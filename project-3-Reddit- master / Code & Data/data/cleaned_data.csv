Being homophobic is anti-men,"As a bi man, I feel like there's lots of anti-LGBT talk in men's rights circles. This is mainly because being effeminate or anti-masculine seems like it's being forced to act womanly, but in fact it's the opposite.

Not letting men act how they want because it's not manly enough or isn't the 'right' kind of masculinity is forcing men to act a certain way. Truly supporting men's rights is letting them act how they want.",0,0,"['Being', 'homophobic', 'is', 'anti', 'men']",Being homophobic is anti-men

Asking for advice in avoiding the wrong type of woman.,"So, being on this sub for a long time has given me a lot of paranoia regarding women. Specifically, avoiding them. I personally lack a lot of social skills, being a social outcast for most of my high school life and even in college. I have friends who were falsely accused of rape and had their lives ruined because of these allegations (one killed himself because he was completely ostracised, even from his family).

I have started living on my own in an unfamiliar environment and was wondering if there are general red flags to look for or just advice like that on avoiding the type of woman who would falsely accuse me of certain actions. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

Apparently men’s shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes. I got to the shoe aisle, and noticed immediately that there was a designated ladies’ shoes section, a designated kids shoes section... and that was it. There’s literally no men’s shoes section. Slightly annoyed at this, I figured they were probably just hidden against the back wall on the opposite side of the kids section from the ladies shoes. And they were. Kind of. There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men’s shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men’s shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second. Why on earth is there a section of women’s boots smack dab in the middle? It’s on the exact other side of the shoe section from the ladies shoes. The heck is this? How painful are they going to make shoe shopping? I just want one decent pair of shoes. And the guys selection is so narrow that if it’s not freakin cowboy style steel toed boots, it’s classy dress shoes that you would like wear to a wedding. The heck happened to all the sneakers? Oh wait there’s one brand of sneakers with maybe three sizes available, even though the shelves are clearly fully stocked. 

It’s just so frustrating. Okay rant over now.",0,0,"['Apparently', 'men', 's', 'shoes', 'are', 'not', 'a', 'thing']",Apparently men’s shoes are not a thing
(Most) Gay men are on your side,"I'm a 29 year old guy. Been openly gay since I was 12. When I say gay, I don't mean a stereotypical  obnoxious, narcissistic attention seeker at ""pride"" (shame). I mean I am just a regular guy who happens to be into guys. If you passed me in the street, you would just think me any normal bloke and if you remain a regular associate of mine it's highly likely a few years before the penny drops and you realise I'm gay.

I want all of you to know that all men (and women in fact, but this is not about them) share the burden of the current social climate. I hate being lumped in with the ""gay community"" because to me it's gone so loopy and so far aligned with feminist/gender ideology that to be associated with it is an embarrassment. Please understand there are countless other gay men just like me who are the silent majority. We aren't all insufferable narcissists trying to join the coven. 

I've been in a stable relationship with my partner for 5 years now and we really do have the most wonderful, equal and loving relationship. Both of us are so aghast at the current state of ""liberal"" politics to the point we've resolved to eventually getting a place in the country and becoming self-sufficient so we can watch the world burn from afar.

Chicks can’t hear the word “no”,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in this particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably deep due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. 

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Toxic masculinity ruining men’s mental health. Sexual assault on men is serious too.,"I could write a whole book on this; mens rights, and toxic masculinity. But one thing that I do not understand, is the perception to many women I try and talk to (I don’t force these topics, this just happens when they come up) that I’m against women’s rights, and “can not say this because I’ve never felt true oppression”. I’m not even saying oppression here. What I’m saying, is that I think rights should be equal across the board. Women’s rights does good things. BLM does good things. Many movements do good things, but supporting mens rights does not make me a fascist conservative. I look at many of the situations that have happened to me, and close friends of mine, and if you were to flip the genders, people would be in jail. For example, I, not my friend have been physically tied down, and raped. I mean I’m 6’5”, 200 something pounds. I do not need to be physically scared of that. But things that have happened to me is mentally manipulated into sex among other things. Said “no I don’t want that” for them to be like “it’s ok it’s ok”, or a girl berating me to her friends that I wouldn’t fuck her, so I gave in to things out of guilt. Or after things fall off with that person, and I am perceived as the bad guy because I could not live up to her sexual needs, and lose many friends over it. This is happening to a close friend of mine, and he has failed to see it. Everyone laughs when he tells people “I don’t wanna fuck her but she makes me”. It’s funny, because he’s a guy. But it’s not funny. It can fuck you up. For 5 years I could not even think of having sex, and now, I still have a bad relationship with sex because I fear that something bad will come of it; that I’ll become a bad guy because of it, or like I am a villain when I don’t want to have sex (god bless my girlfriend for being great with this). But I am normally laughed at for this. It is not taken seriously. My friend, does not take me seriously, yet is miserable in his situation. He won’t get out of it, because he’s been manipulated to think it’s ok (he now even knows it’s not ok but doesn’t know what to do). 

And there is toxic masculinity. These issues come up, and I’ve heard girls tell guys to “man up and fuck me”. Or when a guy comes out with these sort of issues, they are laughed at because “you’re a guy, you liked it”. Or when a man’s mental health is in shambles and they are told to “toughen up” everyday, until one day they kill themselves. In October 5 people. 5 peers of mine, ranging from kids I coach, to a second father though out childhood of mine took their own lives. In one month. They cried for help, but we didn’t hear them because “they will tough it out”. I watched a man drink himself away, depressed, drunken and dying. Everyone saw he needed help, but no one helped him. He died in October too. What I want, is not to abolish women’s rights, I think they are meaningful. What I want is to be treated the same, and the mental (and physical) wellbeing of men to be treated the same as our female or non-binary peers. I know what the stats say. I know these sexual abuse cases are less common. But they do happen, and but they are not treated the same. 

We can be hurt too. We can be mentally hurt and scarred, but no one likes to recognize that.",1,0,"['Toxic', 'masculinity', 'ruining', 'men', 's', 'mental', 'health', 'Sexual', 'assault', 'on', 'men', 'is', 'serious', 'too']",Toxic masculinity ruining men’s mental health.

Men can't say no? [YouTube: Mediocre Tutorials and Reviews],"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70UAAaOmKfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70UAAaOmKfY)

""My body my cho... oh, I forgot, I got a dick. I'm *supposed* to be the horny, perverted sex.""

I've been trying to make a list of all the things that a man could say no for, and it oddly fluctuates, though some are obvious:

* Not attracted
* Don't feel like it
* May be too good to be true
* In a relationship
* Faithful to a religion
* Scared of STDs
* Don't want kids or get trapped
* Masculinity or pride

Notice how some of these women seem to have been stuck in ""female empowerment"" echo chambers where they are taught they are *automatically* the most entitled of anything. Especially the aggressive ""yellow"" haired woman. Women want equality, but still reap the exclusive double standard benefits of being a woman, which are stronger than whatever privileges we are supposed to have, whatever they are.

I could lose my brother,"Hi guys, im in tears writing this as I just learned that my brothers ex has put an AVO out on him with the accusation that he stalked her, drove past her house and followed her in his car. My brother cut communications with this girl and even being near her causes him to hyperventilate badly and eventually have an asthma attack. No evidence has been presented of this happening as his ex's house has security cameras.   


My biggest worry is that if she wins and the AVO is out then she can say at any time that hes near her and the cops will pick him up and he goes to jail for 2 years plus a $5.500 fine no questions asked. Our town is extremely small which means he could be seeing our cousin while shes at Mcdonalds and he gets picked up because of the 100m radius on the AVO.

"Wikipedia labeling a football (soccer) player as ""sexual harasser""","So out of curiosity I decided to check the Wikipedia page of a football (soccer) player who plays for a club in my country (I saw the result of a match played recently).  
And while I was looking at his personal life where I saw a sentence that made me angry and dissappointed  
Quote:  He is the son of former international basketball player and inductee of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2019 Mohsen Medhat Warda. And he is a sexual harasser"". 

He is accused of sexual harassement from a woman who claims that he harassed her sexually via Snapchat. They never met in person (if they did she does not mention it at all) and the only communication was via Snapchat messages (everything according to her claims). 

If he did harass her let the court decide if he is guilty or not (she said she will show the messages to the authorities). 

It is just sad for men to be judged like that. You are accused of sexual harrasment and everyone is pointing a finger at you. You are guilty before the case even reaches the court. Ηe faced similar accusations in the past which resulted him being dropped from his national team pickings but later returned due to lack of evidence. Unfortunatelly for him when the manager changed, he did not participate again. It can cause a lot of damage in a player's career because he can easily be dropped from being a key player to being sat on the sidelines until this is over. Not just for his national team but for whatever club he plays for

I posted a link to the article so everyone can have a look. It is in Greek though (Could not find anything in English)  but the description basically says what I wrote here. It states her claims and that now a lot of women contacted her to say that he harrassed them as well. You can take a look at the images which contain her messages and her claims (these are in English).",0,0,"['Wikipedia', 'labeling', 'a', 'football', 'soccer', 'player', 'as', 'sexual', 'harasser']","Wikipedia labeling a football (soccer) player as ""sexual harasser"""

Gender Differences in Suicide Prevention Responses: Implications for Adolescents Based on an Illustrative Review of the Literature," [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4377906/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4377906/)

This review considered a broad array of published and peer-reviewed research that evidenced gender differences in the effectiveness of suicide prevention efforts. Twenty-two studies evaluate common universal prevention programs as well as targeted programs were used. 

The main type of programs that are analyzed are: school-based prevention programs, community-based prevention programs and health-based prevention programs.

The results of this review point to the priority for tailoring prevention programs so that adolescents, a high-risk group for suicidal behavior, can maximally benefit. Currently, females appear to be the primary beneficiaries of several prevention efforts, while males more often exhibit deleterious effects from exposure to programming. Concerted effort is needed to promote strategies that will also benefit males. A fruitful direction may be to separately implement and administer programming to males and females. For hard-to-reach males, preference-based programming allows an element of independence.",0,0,"['Gender', 'Differences', 'in', 'Suicide', 'Prevention', 'Responses', 'Implications', 'for', 'Adolescents', 'Based', 'on', 'an', 'Illustrative', 'Review', 'of', 'the', 'Literature']",Gender Differences in Suicide Prevention Responses: Implications for Adolescents Based on an Illustrative Review of the Literature

Circumcision shouldn’t be allowed for consenting adults either.,"I always hear talk about how circumcision shouldn’t be allowed until 18 (or whatever the adult age is). However, allowing it at 18 is wrong for the following reasons:

1. If I went to a hospital and asked them to chop off my finger, they would refuse, and rightfully so. If a person wants a healthy part of them removed, they must be grossly misinformed into thinking that’s a good thing.

2. If (in western countries, presumably) an adult woman went to the hospital and asked for FGM, she’d likely be refused. Rightfully so. Why should MGM be any different?

3. Stemming from the first two points, there will be so much propaganda thrown to intact children to pressure them into making a horrible choice the moment they turn legal. Propaganda from adamant cut people who could no longer mutilate children at birth, propaganda from the for-profit medical industry that still wants its revenue...how much is a choice a choice at 18 if you’ve been miseducated and brainwashed into making that choice? To me it’s not unlike the college and predatory loan situation in the US.

TLDR; the legal starting point should be that the foreskin is recognized with the same respect that fingers are: A healthy part that no one should be able to request an amputation of for cosmetic reasons.",0,0,"['Circumcision', 'shouldn', 't', 'be', 'allowed', 'for', 'consenting', 'adults', 'either']",Circumcision shouldn’t be allowed for consenting adults either.
Surrogacy as a single man,"What's up men! Even though my mind is made up to remain single in order not to fall victim to marital laws, I'm certain I want to be a father. I live in western Europe and I intend to save up 10k dollars to pay for a surrogate mother in my home country. If you're wondering why it's so cheap, I'm from a developing country and 10k is a whole lot of money over there. 

The problem I have now is that I feel a bit awkward for considering this option. I'm the first child(and only son) in my family as well as the first grandchild from my mother's family and ideally everyone would love to see me in a huge wedding paid for by family followed by a big ceremony for the birth of my first child. I know these ideas may seem weird to people in the West but it's tradition where I'm from. I guess what I'm asking of you men is to help me feel less awkward about going against my tradition and disappointing my family. Of course, I'll be an object of gossip amongst people in my community if I finally choose this path.

When matched for age, race, prior offending, type and severity of offending, the study finds that:  
\-A substantially larger percentage of males receive prison than do females (47% compared to 33%, respectively)  
\-A substantially larger percentage of females receive probation than do males (42% compared to 34%, respectively)  
\-Male sex oﬀenders receive longer sentences than female sex oﬀenders. Males on aver-age receive prison sentences that are more than 20 months longer than those assigned to females (102.9 compared to 81.4), intensive probation sentences that are on average 1.5 months longer (20 compared to 18.5), and probation sentence lengths that are on aver-age 5 months longer (62.7 compared to 57.).  
Male sex oﬀenders, all else equal, are perceived to be more dangerous and culpable than their female counterparts and so experience more punitive and incapacitating sanctions.  
But the study is too female empathic. Its conclusion try to find excuse for judge:   
""these ﬁndings do not support advocating for policies that “even the score” by becoming more punitive for females""  
And they go on on how maybe male offenders are really more dangerous, that male cannot be treated without prison or that women cannot be treated in prison (like all the feminist bullshits saying that prisons is not for women). They say all that without any proof. Instead of being concerned that female abusers are given a free pass, are in liberty while potentially dangerous and are not punished for their action, they prefer to protect female sex offenders. What is funny is that they were wondering about if they were going to find that women would be punished harsher. I wonder if their reacrion would have been: ""do not punish women lighter"" or ""policy should be immediately implemented to be faire toward women !"" ? ",0,0,"['Study', 'The', 'Gender', 'Gap', 'in', 'Sex', 'Offender', 'Punishment']",Study: The Gender Gap in Sex Offender Punishment

Participants ( N= 423; 276 women and 147 men) read a vignette depicting either a couple having consensual sex (control), or a male or female aggressor who initiates sexual intercourse via verbal coercion, use of alcohol, or physical abuse. College students were provided with legal instructions of sexual assault then asked to pro-vide a verdict, degree of guilt, and legal components.

Ratings of guilt were lower when the aggressor was female compared to male. In addition, male victims were more likely to be perceived as providing consent and less likely to experience fear of bodily injury when the aggressor was female.


Male were aslo less likely to put the blame on male victims but I believe that they found that result because men and boys only learn that they are potential rapists, not potential victims.",0,0,"['Study', 'Evaluations', 'of', 'Sexual', 'Assault', 'Perceptions', 'of', 'Guilt', 'and', 'Legal', 'Elements', 'for', 'Male', 'and', 'Female', 'Aggressors', 'Using', 'Various', 'Coercive', 'Strategies']",Study: Evaluations of Sexual Assault: Perceptions of Guilt and Legal Elements for Male and Female Aggressors Using Various Coercive Strategies

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/320276?seq=1#metadata\_info\_tab\_contents](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/320276?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

Males offenders receive substantially longer sentences. These disparities are primarily generated by departures from the guidelines, rather than differential sentencing within the guidelines. Departures produce about 70 percent of the male-female difference. Meaning that it was not because of the context that this disparity exists (as feminists want us to believe) but because judges get out of their way to help women. Males are also less likely to get no prison term when that option is available; less likely to receive downward departures ; and more likely to receive upward adjustments and, conditioned on having a downward departure, receive smaller reductions than females.

downward departures: judges giving lesss than the minimum sentence

upward adjustments: Higher sentence than what is asked",0,0,"['Racial', 'Ethnic', 'and', 'Gender', 'Disparities', 'in', 'Sentencing', 'Evidence', 'from', 'the', 'U', 'S', 'Federal', 'Courts']","Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities in Sentencing: Evidence from the U.S. Federal Courts"
"Study: The Determinants of Punishment: Deterrence, Incapacitation and Vengeance (drivers who kill women get 56 percent longer sentences)","

About murders:

""Male offenders receive a 6.2 year longer sentence than female offenders if the victim is female and a 6.9 year longer sentence if the victim is male. Killing a woman also results in a substantially longer sentence. For male offenders, killing a woman increases the sentence length by 4.2 years. For female offenders, killing a woman results in a 4.9 year longer sentence.""

Therefore if you are a male murderer, you are punished harder. Whatever you sex, if you murder a woman, you are punished harder.

About drivers who kill someone:

""In the Bureau of Justice Statistics data, the gap for male offenders between male victims and female victims is 5.1 years""

If you run over a man, you will get a 5.1 years shorter sentences, than if you kill a women. It means 53% shorter sentence.",0,0,"['Study', 'The', 'Determinants', 'of', 'Punishment', 'Deterrence', 'Incapacitation', 'and', 'Vengeance', 'drivers', 'who', 'kill', 'women', 'get', '56', 'percent', 'longer', 'sentences']","Study: The Determinants of Punishment: Deterrence, Incapacitation and Vengeance (drivers who kill women get 56 percent longer sentences)"

"Asking for Advice: Men over the age of thirty who experienced sexual violence or assault as a child, what are some things your partner can do to help?","So I wanted to ask after the experiences of men who sought help due to the experience of sexual assault or violence in their childhood. My (24f) boyfriend (38m) is a survivor of childhood sexual assault but he doesn’t feel comfortable talking about it, I only know that it happened when he was very young and it was his older brother who assaulted him. I don’t know where, exactly when or what happened and I’ve never told anyone else. 

He very casually references his trauma in conversation as if it’s no big deal, an indicator I recognise as one of severe and unresolved childhood trauma. He says quite shocking things in passing like it’s all good and it’s nothing to worry about, but when I ask if he wants to explain more or discuss it with me further he instantly withdraws and goes quiet. 

I immediately believed him of course, and never questioned the validity of his experience. I’m always gentle and don’t try to prove him for answers. 

It’s not my right to know since it’s his story and I completely respect that. He told me the first time I asked that “you wouldn’t want to know what happened to me.” So I gently told him that it’s not about “wanting” because nobody wants to know that kind of thing and how it happened to a child, but it’s about need, since I’m his partner and I love him I feel it’s important that he tell me things like that. But I’m not pushing, like I said, it’s his story and I followed up by telling him that it’s his life and when he decides I need to know is entirely up to him. I reassured him that it’s 100% ok if he decides that I never need to know. 

But I feel like this has impacted him heavily for a long time. He was in an abusive relationship for about 15 years and I suspect that his ex wife either didn’t believe him, belittled him for his assault, or he never told her. As a result, he constantly deals with thoughts of depression and struggled at the beginning of our relationship accepting simple acts of care and consideration. He never puts himself or his own desires first, in almost every regard. He works himself to the bone and almost never allows himself any free time. He often puts himself down, calls himself ugly and fat and overweight despite looking like a normal man his age and height. He feels he doesn’t deserve good things and has told me that’s how he feels about himself.

body-shaming women isn't okay but doing it to men is okay and funny to most people,"have you ever heard about a plus-size male model? no because they  don't exist, it okay to shame men for having small penises or being shorter than 6ft ( only 20% of men are 6ft or taller ) on Twitter for example if a male disagree with a girl's opinion its a small dick energy but god forbid you to want to date a girl with a healthy weight

also something i noticed is that actors and famous men who get hair transplants or take hair loss medication  are shamed by the media and its considered a scandal

why are femisnsts ( and most women who identify as feminsts ) so self centered and think women only deal with problems ?,"an example is  how women think that only the women in the middle east are oppressed which isn't true 

i have 2 middle eastern male friends they were SEVERLY physically abused like using electricity to shock them or using heated metal ( which is common in some places like Egypt ) and one of them LITERALLY  lost his spleen because of getting beaten  meanwhile female get only screamed at ( they are physically abused sometimes too but not as bad a men )

males are expected to go into good colleges and work extremely hard jobs ( as young as 10 ) meanwhile females stay at home which is bad but not as bad

female circumcision in the middle east is illegal male circumcision is legal and expected

meanwhile, feminists are like WoMeN iN tHe MiDdLe EaSt HaVe It HaRd ThEy CaNt DrEsS hOw ThEy LiKe ( i know women there have it bad but what men deal with there is much more horrible )

&amp;#x200B;

also how they complain about beauty standards yet they fate men above 6ft only, they complain about domestic violence  1in4 men are victims of domestic violence and 1in3 women but 96% of perpetrators are males which proofs that women get away easily without any punishment, they complain about rape and when men complain about false accusations they are met with hate even tho the proven actual rape cases are 1.5% and the proven false allegations cases are 8-10%

&amp;#x200B;

she completely scratched me \[...\]the guys are like, ‘‘You’re bleeding.’’ she didn’t get kicked out. There have also been times when girls just grab your penis... and they grab hard.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One girl attempted to put her finger up my butthole \[...\] It’s like they think they can do anything they want.

&amp;#x200B;

""she pulled his G-string away from his rear-end, and attempted to shove a dollar bill into his anus.""

&amp;#x200B;

""She was going crazy ... like physically. Scratching me and biting. Biting my ass, my thighs, my arms, like whatever she could grab. I got bit on my ass and it was purple for a week. It wasn’t a bachelorette party ... it was just a regular night. You never know where they’re coming from ""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Matt a stripper

&amp;#x200B;

Women are a lot more aggressive than the men are. They really are. They try to take my clothes completely off. \[...\] You have really aggressive women and I didn’t know that. It’s very intimidating. One time this woman was tugging at my \[underwear\]. I don’t have anything under there, like there’s no G-string or anything. So some people really try to pull them off and they’re really aggressive. They try to bite you too. Like any girl that gets too close ... I have to push them away. It gets me more uncomfortable because I’m already uncomfortable.

We need to start blaming tradcons more for not taking mens issues seriously,The stereotype that men cant be victims of DV or rape or whatnot has been around for the past 5000 years so its not really accurate to blame feminists. Imo its more so the tradcons who still see women as innocent little creatures incapable of harm.

Greatest Feminist Myth: Feminism is about equality of BOTH genders.," 

When you **google** feminism, this is what comes up :

&gt;Feminism is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and **social equality of the sexes.**

This seems to imply that feminism implies **gender equality.**

OPEN THAT ARTICLE FOR FUCKS SAKE AND READ IT.

&gt;Feminism is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes.\[a\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4\]\[5\] Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the **male** point of view, and that **women** are treated unjustly within those societies**.**\[6\] Efforts to change that include fighting against gender stereotypes and establishing educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and **outcomes for women that are equal to those for men.**

Feminism ASSUMES that women are below men and by bringing them up or equal to men they are achieving gender equality. **It is NOT PRIMARILY about helping BOTH sexes.** **It's GYNOCENTRIC.**

**Also if there was a movement with the prefix 'fem' before it to help BOTH genders. It is kinda sexist and gynocentric.**",8,0,"['Greatest', 'Feminist', 'Myth', 'Feminism', 'is', 'about', 'equality', 'of', 'BOTH', 'genders']",Greatest Feminist Myth: Feminism is about equality of BOTH genders.

Why is Australia so pro-women without regard to equality?,"If any country refuses to acknowledge facts, it's Australia, India too.

The blind resume initiative is what led me to believe this. 

They wanted more diversity so they thought to remove names from resumes. They though managers were discriminating based on names therefore against women.

When names were removed, women were at a disadvantage. When names were added, they had more call backs...

So they said scratch this initiative which seemed very fair. We don't want to disadvantage women. 

Banning the Red Pill was another, although I'm not sure on censoring laws in Australia.

I understand wanting more women representation in government but to disadvantage men isn't really the way.

"""Locker room talk""... FOR WOMEN","***Let's hear some stories***

When the topic of ""locker room talk"" pops up, I'm sure you've heard a Feminist link that directly to ""toxic masculinity""---that BS Woke concept that implies certain behavioral traits are restricted exclusively to just one sex.

The truth is many men have heard the female equivalent of ""locker room talk."" That's what we're hear to talk about. For instance, how many of you have heard female coworkers talk about the following or similar to:

* all the things they’ve *shared* \*cough\* on OnlyFans (plus all the money they make) and the people they’ve engaged with and which ones they find attractive
* the women who share how they swoon over men in uniforms and how they just want to rip into them (can you imagine the reaction if a guy just announced he would walk up to a woman and rip her top off?)
* Which celebrities or coworkers they want to wrap their legs around
* the female managers who openly share what type of lube they think works best because it doesn't burn their vaginas (seriously, not only did she talk about that stuff with her coworkers, she's the type that acts all offended and ""professional"" if *you talk about sex* cuz that's a No-No)
* or the women who love to socialize with gay men in similar lewd conversations *in your presence* because, by their own admission, they feel safe to talk all they want about dicks with guys present

Yes, I've heard this type of chatter before in the workplace, and I'm sure many of you out there have heard all kinds of things.... ***so let's hear them. Share your best one(s), don't care how many you want to talk about.***

I know men can talk about boobs all day and say a bunch of things in locker rooms, I would just prefer if we stop pretending that one sex does this stuff just to justify their Woke beliefs that ""toxic masculinity"" is a real thing. So let's hear all the types of naughty things women talk about, often to casually and nonchalant at work, the office, or in the classroom -- the kind of things that would invite a hailstorm of Feminist stigmitizations if it was men talking about these things about women.",39,0,"['Locker', 'room', 'talk', 'FOR', 'WOMEN']","""Locker room talk""...

Having an argument in r/MensRights and suddenly a wild moron appears.,"Having a civil discussion on a post regarding consent laws. I stated that my opinion was that minors should be responsible for properly disclosing their age in order for a claim of statutory rape to be valid.

After a civil conversation with a couple of other members of the sub one person in particular seemed quite disagreeable and closed minded. u/anahawkinss disagreed with my statement quite passionately. At first things were alright and we discussed our positions mostly respectfully but after I had dismantled some of the other users arguments are reiterated my own point and that they weren’t going to change my mind the unthinkable happened.

This user on Reddit in the leading mens rights subreddit no less, decided that since they and I had a different opinion and that I wouldn’t change my mind because of them that I must be a pedophile. u/anahawkinss attempted a number of times in several of their comments to assassinate my character with false and slanderous statements along the lines of me being a “pedo”. 

I think it is absolutely shameful for a person who runs out of arguments to resort to personal attacks and especially one so heinous. In the men’s rights subreddit of all places to make such a wild and baseless statement.

From askfeminists FAQ,"Why don't feminists care more about men's issues?

Feminism has mixed feelings about directly addressing men’s problems. Many feminists fear that addressing men’s issues, or “gender issues” as a broad goal, will move the conversation completely away from women’s issues (remember, we live in a male-dominated society still). So instead they focus on women’s issues, and allow others to focus on their issues. Many feminists would like to see pro-feminist men tackle men’s issues in a way that doesn’t blame women and feminism for all their problems (see MRAs). Many feminists do care about men's issues, but demanding that feminists dedicate exactly 50% of their time and resources to such things is unreasonable. Please check out



As I've said, feminism isn't about equality for all, it's about equality when women have a disadvantage. 

But specifically look at the part of men handle men's issues. But no one cares about men's issues. NO ONE. Not you fuckers. 70% of you care about bashing feminism. (I know I'll get replies only for this comment)

This sub needs to be a little less about hating feminism and more about men's issues. Im not going to respond to you if you want to mention all examples of how feminism has done men a disservice. 

There are bad apples and bad laws. I'm tired of attacking feminism. It's a losing battle.

Focus on luring people to help mens issues, instead 70% of y'all are blaming feminism.

Again, PROGRESS MENS ISSUES. Toxic feminism is going to bring itself down don't worry.

Large declines in men going to college since Covid,"https://hechingerreport.org/the-pandemic-is-speeding-up-the-mass-disappearance-of-men-from-college/

Some brave people out there speaking out...

&gt; While enrollment in higher education overall fell 2.5 percent in the fall, or by more than 461,000 students compared to the fall of 2019, the decline among men was more than seven times as steep as the decline among women, according to an analysis of figures from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.

protecting a man with a security system,"I won't name any names in this, for obvious reasons.  Some years back, it was my job to help a man get his security system up and running, including cameras.  What was going on was he was recently divorced and had visitation rights with his 13 year-old daughter.  However, his vindictive and hateful ex wife was trying to destroy his visitation rights, and his relationship with his daughter altogether.

For those of you not familiar with security cameras, let me explain.  There are two basic approaches to making recordings.  1. You could have cameras that use motion detection to choose whether to record.  No motion = no recording, but if someone walks in front of the camera, it triggers motion and you thus get a clip that gets placed on the cloud.  The idea is to only record what's relevant.  There is no continuous recording.  2. Continuous recording to an SVR.  As the name suggests, this type of system records continuously and keeps the video saved to a hard drive on an SVR, a device similar to the DVR that you use to record TV.

So my job was to get this gentleman's cameras converted over from the motion-based recording system to a continuous SVR-based one.  His reason for wanting the change was simple.  His ex wife was falsely accusing him of molesting their 13 year-old daughter.  He felt the need to have positive proof that he was doing no such thing.  I knew for a fact he wasn't.  If he were doing that, the continuous video would prove that he was.  But he wanted the video system just to get the courts to believe him.  So much for innocent until proven guilty.  Of course, there are some rooms where you typically would not want to have cameras recording, such as the bathroom and the bedroom.  So his plan was to keep the door to the bedroom locked so that she could not go in there even if she wanted to.  Then if she went to the bathroom, he would stay in view of one of the cameras.

I felt bad for the guy, but I was glad to help him defend himself.  I also made sure to state that I'm not a lawyer, but rather a security specialist.  I could help him set up his system and learn how to use it, but I also strongly recommended that he speak with his lawyer to make sure that his strategies were sound.

I never did find out what happened with this gentleman.  Once my job of getting his system up and running was over, I was no longer in touch with him.  The security dealer was then taking over the monitoring of his system.

However, there is one thing I've noticed.  When I relay this story to let feminists know that, yes, false accusations are a real thing that sometimes can happen, they act hostile.  I've been accused of being a ""rape apologist"" for trying to help an innocent man defend himself.  I can only imagine the vitriol his lawyer must get.  The ""believe all women"" slogan is nonsense.  There is no group of people on this Earth that never lies and is never mistaken.  And just because I helped one man to protect himself does not mean I have any sympathy for actual rapists.

Another job I had was to set up an SVR and cameras for a high school teacher to use in his classroom, especially for when he did one-on-one consultations with his students.  He was an unmarried man like me, and was often met with unwarranted suspicion.  With cameras constantly rolling, he had the ability to prove his innocence if he needed to.  Those SVRs don't have unlimited space, btw.  They usually have a 1, 2, or 4 terabyte hard drive.  Depending on the resolution and the number of cameras hooked up to it, it will typically have something like 30 or 60 days worth of footage.  So I had to help the teacher set up a backup system as well, a RAID device that could hold a massive amount of data.  That way he could be protected if someone accused him of molesting them 2 years ago or something.  But even then, there was still the possible danger of footage getting destroyed in a disaster such as a fire or a flood.

What's very disturbing is the number of times I've had conversations with feminists about the importance of due process, and the fact that false accusations are real.  Most of the time, the feminist has shown no concern for the protection of innocent men.  It's baffling to me how some people will take my view that ""you need to protect the innocent from false accusations"" to mean ""I'm fine with women getting raped.""  I don't see any logical correlation to that.

Camera systems can help innocent men, but they have their limitations.  If their footage is lost, they can't protect you.  If the power goes out and any backup power runs out, they stop recording.  They also only protect in specific areas.  That man could only see his 13 year-old daughter in his own home where he knew he was protected.  So much for taking a father/daughter trip to a park or an amusement park or God forbid a road trip.

This is just a small sample of people I've helped with security systems.  This is getting long.  But suffice it to say, I've needed to help men in many more situations than the ones described here.  In my own life, I've also experienced people automatically assuming I'm some kind of predator.  People flipped out when I went to a national park with a DSLR camera and a long lens.  I was there to photograph birds, but people assumed I was some kind of perv who wanted pictures of their kids.

I'd doubt I'm the only one with stories like this.  These stories are real.  And I've got a bunch more.

The patriarchy myth,"The patriarchy. We’ve all heard of it. It’s a mystical society run by men which benefits men. The patriarchy that lets men be the largest majority of men living on the streets
Or the patriarchy that lets boys underperform compared to their female counterparts at every level of education. Doesn’t sound like a ‘patriarchy’ to me.
This patriarchy is also responsible for the oppression of women for years according to feminism, however feminism fail to see that now, in the modern era, they are the majority.
This is why we see things like ‘manspreading’, ‘mansplaining’ etc. Women in the west are no longer oppressed, and so they seek oppression in an era in which, oppression is enviable.
Boys are taught from day one that they are dirty and disgusting, while girls are clean and immaculate in every way. Why do we ‘empower’ our daughters in exchange for the self confidence of our sons?

My Law class is sexist.,"I'm not one to preach the term 'sexist' easily. I understand the extreme nature of the term so I don't use it lightly. With that being said, I am currently attending Sixth Form in England (ages 16 to 18), and Law is one of my chosen subjects. My class has 3 boys including myself, and about 25 girls. I didn't mind this at first, okay, my radar for making friends is very slim, but maybe I can get along well with the girls or at least just get my head down and enjoy the course.

The teacher is female, important thing to note. Relatively young for a teacher, so she spends a lot of time each lesson talking to the girls about some recent album that's came out, or some inconvenience they have with putting some make-up on (this is not a generalised stereo-type based comment, they talk about this a lot) and everything else. Okay, I feel slightly neglected in the sense that I can't join in on these conversations, but if I had a male teacher who liked the same things I did, then I wouldn't hesitate to talk to him about football all lesson.

But when the actual class gets going, minor instances build up to me just feeling uncomfortable... The 'casual conversation' I mentioned between the teacher and students normally goes to talk about how lazy and irritating men can be sometimes, and how they would enforce a curfew if they could for men, and then at what times the curfew would start and they just start discussing a male-free utopia. Then they start talking about privilege.

All of this is amplified by the fact that often, in Law A-Level, the teacher will make up a story to help us understand a legal concept, so we need to apply the legal concept to the context of the story and see who is liable and all of that, in these stories, the victim will often be the female and nearly all of the time it is the Male that has been negligent of their child or abused their wife or mistreated female colleagues. It's never a woman committing the crime.

In addition, if the teacher is mentioning an actual case, she'll mention how some man killed his wife, and then a girl in the class will say something along the lines of ""That's shitty"" and then someone else will say ""Men are trash in general"" and all of these case examples and stories just feed into the narrative of the casual conversation and it creates a very toxic classroom environment. Finally, the teacher tends to commend the female students more, she'll never tell a girl that they straight up got the question wrong but she's very blunt to me whenever I get a question wrong. I'm not using this as my main point as this could be a coincidence but I'm just pointing it out.

I think this is the result of the teacher being slightly sexist and the ongoing 'men are trash' narrative that is trendy to preach if you are a teenager. A Law class of 95 percent girls gives the girls a perfect time to put men in a bad light and not reap consequences. I'm a 16 year old student and I just feel uncomfortable in my Law class.

Today is an historic first for the office of Vice President of the United States,"You may have seen the journalists raving today about the historic nature of Kamala Harris being sworn in as Vice President of the United States.  These journalists are right, but for the wrong reasons.

The journalists are gushing about Kamala Harris being the first woman to become Vice President, but that is not actually her achievement.  She didn't earn that one.  Her actual achievement is being the first Vice President to be handed the job via affirmative action.  Instead of explaining the exact details myself, I will refer you to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/jt7bod/the_vice_presidency_is_being_handed_to_kamala/) post by a well-informed Redditor who explains the issue much better than I could.

So in short, we should celebrate Kamala Harris not as America's first female Vice President, but rather as the first affirmative action Vice President of the United States.  Always remember that she was handed the job for checking all the right boxes in a way that no other contender was able to do by the ""merit"" of the genetics she inherited by being born.  That is quite an achievement like no other.

"There is a strong clinical need for discrete mental health and suicide prevention services for men and boys, without the feminist bias of current failing services","Back in 2019 SBS Australia and the Australian Men’s Health Forum (AMHF) reported that the proportions of boys contacting the Australian government and charity funded Kids Helpline had plummeted from 35% of callers to 21% of callers since 2008. This massive failure to engage with boys by the key children’s counselling service was otherwise met with indifference in the mainstream of child mental health service provision and suicide prevention culture. 
https://www.sbs.com.au/news/coronavirus-worries-have-australian-children-calling-kids-helpline-every-69-seconds
https://www.amhf.org.au/kids_helpline_reaching_fewer_boys

Kids Helpline has acknowledged this loss of engagement with boys, but appears to be taking a feminist ideological approach of “boy blaming” when looking for solutions. The Australian Human Rights Commission in conjunction with Kids Helpline, has recently produced a report analysing issues of concern kids have raised in counselling sessions during COVID-¬19, which shows kids have experienced serious impacts on their mental health, social connections and education. But the analysis is fundamentally flawed as the respondents were predominantly female (&gt;75%), and only include a very small proportion of non-LGBTI boys.
https://kiddipedia.com.au/children-experiencing-serious-impacts-during-pandemic/

Kids Helpline conducted a survey of kids using the service and parents, including questions on how to encourage more boys to use the service. However, the questions asked show an entrenched culture of misandry and victim blaming, by focusing poor service use on issue related to masculinity, rather than service provision. 

Q2- How can we engage young boys to have open conversations about their feelings?

Q3- Do you think this is part of a larger conversation about breaking down barriers of gender stereo-types to allow boys to understand it’s ok to be vulnerable &amp; to give them permission to talk about their feelings.?

Q4-Do you think we need to provide more guidance to boys to give them the tools and language to articulate their feelings?

Completely missing from the analysis is any acknowledgement that the service is run by almost entirely by women, both in terms of management and counselling staff, many of who have radical feminist beliefs with histories of public speaking and publications focused almost entirely on the welfare of women and girls. 

This shallow misandrist approach of blaming male stereotypes is entirely sourced from a feminist ideological framing of masculinity (the strawman stereotype), and reveals a service culture at best unsuitable, and at worst, openly hostile to men and boys. The continuing failure of Kids Helpline to engage with boys, and similar problems related to services provided to men and boys by feminist dominated organisations, suggests a high clinical need for discrete services for men and boys, provided by professionals appropriately trained to deliver services without feminist bias and stereotypes, and without male-blaming. 

Unfortunately, it is unlikely that these kinds of effective specialised services will ever be provided given the current gender bias of the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Sex Discrimination Commission, and Kids Helpline. All of these important public services entrusted to provide and oversee the equitable delivery of services to the most vulnerable in our community, are dominated by women with little or no interest in the welfare of men and boys, women entrenched in a culture of feminist stereotypes and misandry.",18,0,"['There', 'is', 'a', 'strong', 'clinical', 'need', 'for', 'discrete', 'mental', 'health', 'and', 'suicide', 'prevention', 'services', 'for', 'men', 'and', 'boys', 'without', 'the', 'feminist', 'bias', 'of', 'current', 'failing', 'services']","There is a strong clinical need for discrete mental health and suicide prevention services for men and boys, without the feminist bias of current failing services"

incest,"I was on a therapy website where random people can privately listen to struggles. I was texting a lady there about my sexual struggles when she asked to discuss my sexual thoughts. I vaguely described them and kept the conversation towards ""sex is dangerous for me because of STIs, false accusations, honey traps, criminal prostitution, and etc."" But she kept belittling the dangers and she asked again to describe the thoughts.

Usually I'd describe the thoughts, but they were sexual. Sexual communications are a bannable offense. I've been suspended a lot from that website for sexting. I felt very insecure about describing my thoughts and didn't really want to. So instead, I asked if she ever had sexual thoughts and how those thoughts were.

She just vaguely described the thoughts with ""Great thoughts"" or some similar phrase. Since she answered so vaguely, I replied ""I think you are lying."" So she texted ""I had great sex with my stepson last night,"" or some similar phrase. I immediately blocked her.

Any other man might've asked her to go into details or may have fantasized about that, but I didn't. I remembered a lot of posts on r/mensrights about women who sexually abuse boys and men. 

How would a woman feel if she were talking with a man who said ""I had great sex with my step daughter last night?"" That man would probably be reported to the police for child sexual abuse. Men already face stereotypical allegations of pedophilia, to the extent where some orphanages might reject foster applicants simply due to gender. I've been on a babysitting website where nearly 90% of babysitters were women and where my babysitting account was deleted and refunded without explanation.

Some people might assume the step son is an adult who tempted his step mom. But let's be real: the step mom could've complained about the step son's sexual advances to his father or the orphanage. And then why would the step mom be referencing such incest as a great sexual experience? She has the parental authority alone to thwart off her step son's sexual advances, and to even return him to the orphanage under sexual criminal or civil charges. And why would any step son risk losing a parent or supporter for sex?

Her incest can easily involve into an envious fight between the son and the father. Even without the father, the step mom legally has more power than her step son. She can probably kick him out for a night if he stares at another woman. Incest is horrible and that step son is in a lot of crap now. 

On that therapy website, random women tend to block me whenever I describe my sexual thoughts upon request, but today I ended up blocking a woman instead. The reversal is all very interesting. From now on, whenever I'm having a conversation with another women there, I should ask her about her thoughts before disclosing my thoughts. I don't want to be perverted there by women who practice incest.",5,0,['incest'],incest

It always seemed no matter how much effort I put in my grade would either be the same or worse, almost like someone was just saying “nah fuck you your grade is a 67”.

Before we went virtual for this god awful pandemic I usually got really good grades on tests (80s-90s) except for classes on subjects I wasnt very enriched in and just couldn’t concentrate in like English (70s-80s) but now that they don’t have to return the test and show us what we did wrong my test grades have been around the 50-70 range.

Nothing changed the tests aren’t very hard at all (tbh it’s even easier now that I can Google shit that I forget) but now that tests aren’t being sent back to show me what I did wrong my grades even on subjects I’m very good at and very interested in (which means I actively try to learn more about these subjects outside of school and often ponder about them) like math and science classes are slipping?

Coincidence? Definitely not, like I said the subject material is not hard at all the only real thing holding me back is my poor memory and ADHD (which fucks my concentration beyond belief but only when I’m totally uninterested otherwise I’m fine)

A rant about #notallmen,"I want to preface this by saying that while I am not a self identified feminist, I do agree with and support the core values of feminism in principle. What I don't agree with is the whole #notallmen mockery. The sarcastic, eye rolling, straw man style of argument is a complete double standard. ""Women are materialistic"" = sexist hate speech. Meanwhile, ""Men (the same gigantic generalization) actively try to suppress and control women"" = finally someone had the courage to say it. Then the arguments start and the easiest way to dismiss the opposition is the #notallmen defence. The unspoken, assumed, unwritten rule that all women have the right to bad mouth ""men"" as a general term because they only refer to the many bad guys out there in the world. Anyone who gets offended by the generalization has CLEARLY missed the point. They weren't talking about you. In fact, they take it a step further. Not only is your complaint about their generalization pointless, but it is its own kind of attack on them. They already have so many moleters, harrassers, attackers, and such to worry about. Now, they have to worry about you! A typical man who doesn't get the joke and feels offended. It's no wonder that these feminist women have no patience for comments or criticisms about their choice of words or style of speech. They already feel ignored, exploited, and harmed by social norms and men most of all. As a husband who works a full time job in China, washes/hangs the laundry, cooks regularly, does the dishes, vacuums and mops the floor, takes out the garbage, feeds the cats and cleans their litter everyday, blah, blah, blah, on and on, THE POINT IS the #notallmen sarcasm relies on constant  antagonism, insults, and shame.  Obviously, the world is an unfair and unbalanced place. It was NOT deliberately designed by generations of evil men. History set us ALL on this path, we are in it together and should be more considerate to one another. Enough with these blanket, hurtful statements about gender. They do nothing but fuel the fire of resentment and division between all of our common goals.",17,0,"['A', 'rant', 'about', 'notallmen']",A rant about #notallmen

Legal Question,"Without going into too much detail, my ex-fiancée and I have had numerous legal battles over the last year concerning our infant son. She terminated the relationship halfway through the pregnancy and more or less told me that she would raise the baby without me. I successfully took her to court and was granted joint custody. For the past five months, he has split his time evenly between two parents. 

I have petitioned to change his last name to mine, as his mother wouldn’t allow it at birth. I am wondering how successful you guys think my petition will be. 

Things worth mentioning: I am the plan holder for the medical insurance that covers him as a dependent, I have no criminal conviction (or even a speeding ticket) on my record, I signed his birth certificate and the mother has signed a form acknowledging that I am the biological father. I’m hoping that at worst the judge decides to hyphenate the name so that my name is still on his birth certificate.

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights. 

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

The Deafening Silence of Reasonable Women,"Hi all, 

Back in August, I was having some drinks one evening in the bar patio with a couple of dozen younger friends, and was pulled up by a 20-something friend - who otherwise considers himself a Conservative, despite hailing from a very leftist area - and his female friend, about a t-shirt I had on, depicting nubile women, shall we say, approaching states of undress.  

You guessed it - I got the usual patter about ""Objectifying"", ""Sex objects"" etc.  

I replied, ""Guys - it's Saturday night.  This is a public house (bar).  You have to be 18 and over to be drinking here, so we're all grownups and can handle a little skin, especially as there's no genitalia or nipples depicted.""  My friend launched into a diatribe about women's ""feelings""...you can guess I steered the convo onto other matters pretty quick. 

Now, in summer, I wear such t-shirts precisely because so few people do, because there are so few left available in the shops.  Because our rights to do what we men do are under ceaseless attack.  This is my way of flying the flag, or rather, wearing it.  And I've been doing so a decade, now.  

This was the 2nd, maybe third young woman in that time who has expressed distaste.  One bi girl expressed lust over a particularly attractive girl displayed, and we had a chuckle, TOGETHER - two very different people - about taking it in turns with the girl.  Share and share alike.... :) But I digress. 

The point is this....where is the reasonable, yet outspoken, contingent of women?  It's often said that the heaviest brains are the quietest.  The ones who would give a lucid, cogent insight into the way they view my t shirts.  Or view anything.  

The ones who'd say, ""Look mate, we women don't want to be considered weak or neurotic, but the truth is yes, we ARE physically weaker, more prone to depression/neuroses etc, we don't play Chess, Darts, or drive F1 with even a tenth of the success of men or half of us suffer from body dysmorphia, some of us are feminists who are sore seeing so many naked women, and some of us are outright jealous of these young fitties because we can't have such powerful attraction to men.  And of course you have a small minority of women, a tiny minority even, who don't suffer any of the aforementioned hangups, and think it's a healthy male libido that appreciates womanly curves, drum tight skin and thick, long, lustrous hair"".  

Yeah, a few of you guys are laughing right now - and a fewer still gnashing your teeth in anger - at the thought of a woman (n)ever uttering such deep, and frank truths.   Yet I'm CONVINCED such women exist, millions of them even, but in a collective state of fear, only daring to tell the truth to those lucky enough to be their husbands, sons, brothers and even rarer best male friends.  Their collective silence, I would submit to you, is WORSE than the feminists; the latter at least leave you in no doubt about their stupidity, but what about OUR right to have sense about women coming from all angles including from women?

(on a wider perspective, society's nasty habit of withholding the truths that are painful for everyone in the short term but beneficial to the recipient long term, whilst disguising it as ""Politeness"", is something I find deeply immoral - but sadly that's outside the scope of this sub)   

For a gender that prides itself on its communication skills, women are staggeringly poor at relaying exactly what bothers them.   I suspect that to do so, in this case, would first require them to self-analyze to an extremely uncomfortable degree, the ultimate conclusions exposing them to their hypocrisy - those being that despite their protestations of equality, they were never equal, and never going to be equal.  That lack of honesty, with us men in particular and with themselves in general, imo, is one of womanhood's greatest modern failures - perhaps its greatest.",9,0,"['The', 'Deafening', 'Silence', 'of', 'Reasonable', 'Women']",The Deafening Silence of Reasonable Women
What is Positive or Good Masculinity,"Okay before I start off, this question is semi rhetorical. I feel like I kind of know what good and positive masculinity is or at least what it should be. But it just seems like all the media and Feminist publications ever talk about is Toxic Masculinity and they never talk about Good Masculinity. They always insist that not all Masculinity is bad and yet they never tell us exactly what exactly it is in Masculinity that isn't bad. I'm sorry if this is coming off like a rant but I have honestly have just reached my limit on hearing the term ""Toxic Masculinity"" all over social media and even in the news. I really just want to hear good things about masculinity especially from feminists, the same people who say they don't hate men yet often say very hateful things about men.

"Gender pay gap is a claim to bring men down: If women are cheaper to employ, why don't businesses fire all men and hire women..."," Gender pay gap does not make sense: If women are cheaper to employ, why don't businesses fire all men and hire women? 

I can't understand feminist non-sense. Men and women must have equal access to employment, which they do. The fact that there is a pay gap does not mean anything. For example, women might have different priorities in life and less experience compared to men. Also, they choose different professions that pay less and are more likely to work part-time. Assuming that women get paid less than men within the same post/company, even though they have the same qualifications, experience and performance, then it could be said that women do not negotiate their salaries hard enough or prefer to apply to lower paying posts/adverts, because they perceive these positions as less competitive.

If there is a gap we must empower women to take more risks, instead of bringing down men and nurturing victim culture, conflict and hatred.",109,0,"['Gender', 'pay', 'gap', 'is', 'a', 'claim', 'to', 'bring', 'men', 'down', 'If', 'women', 'are', 'cheaper', 'to', 'employ', 'why', 'don', 't', 'businesses', 'fire', 'all', 'men', 'and', 'hire', 'women']","Gender pay gap is a claim to bring men down: If women are cheaper to employ, why don't businesses fire all men and hire women..."

Why are schools so sexist sometimes?,"At school this girl was being a petty little jerk in like 5th grade (I’m not gonna get into the whole story unless you want me to) but anyway towards the end of it all she started hurling some profanity and I told on her, it was 5th grade you can’t blame me that much, and this always sexist gym teacher said “mind your own business and just eat your lunch.” And so I was dumbfounded. Then this little crotch goblin told the same gym teacher “he was swearing at me and calling me names.” And he tells my teacher. My teacher had multiple witness accounts against this and other numerous times she’s said some real vulgar crap.

The things that made me want to join r/MensRights (Love you guys btw),"\*Warning: this could be upsetting or triggering, contains sexual abuse\*

&amp;#x200B;

I saw a story from a guy who was violently raped when he was young.

That already got me upset. But it gets worse.

When he decided to open up and get therapy, the therapist told him that he didn't believe him, and called child protective services on him because they assumed the man was abusing his wife and children. The guy divorced his wife because he was scared he would hurt them or something bad  would happen.

So basically, a therapist, a person meant to believe in and help people, looked at an emotionally unstable person who has been through serious trauma and reached out for help and thought:

This person is a man, he must be terrible.

Honestly, why???

The other thing that made me want to join was Johnny Depp's and Amber Heard's crazy ""Nobody will believe you because you're a man"" thing.

Then there's the overall radical feminist thing. Honestly the worst.

The last thing is, women are really privileged these days, and can be absolutely toxic.

Women also get compliments and such all the time.

Men's suicide rate and severe self-harm rate is much higher than women's; but they remain bashed by the internet and in general. When was the last time a man got a hug or a compliment without being attacked or called gay?

"""Never get committed (marriage) &amp; Never provide to her ” Not MGTOW","Feminist have pushed Women not perform the feminine role and denounce responsibility to their actions. It's high time men denounce their roles too

In my point of view traditional masculine and feminine role served a purpose. To keep checks and balances for both men and women in the society.

Men provide and protect the house. Women provide kids and make the house into a liveable home. Both promised monogamy and care for each other in marriage.

Now this is being dismantled step by step &amp; promotes favouring only to women.

I am not suggesting mgtow, but some what similar. Sleep around don't commit to relationship, until your extremely sure. Consider this as your marriage. Don't buy her anything concrete(gifts, cars, house or money). If you spend on her make sure you are a part of it like a dinner, vacation trip. Don't sponsor spa &amp; make overs, that's her responsibility to keep her attractive to you. If she pushes for marriage, start searching for your new mate and break up when you find one. You will always find a better one. 

If you are like me and want a kid, hire a surrogate mother (cheaper than a car) to have your own kid or adopt.

strange request,"The other day, I was at the store when a young woman asked me to take her card out of the ATM. Allegedly her nails were preventing her to take the card out.

Now I'm a nice guy. Whenever any woman asks me to reach for something that's high on a shelf in a food store, I reach for it.

But I had to get a card, not food. And I had to get it from an ATM machine, not a shelf. So I said that I couldn't help with her card because I didn't want to infect her with COVID-19.

She wasn't disabled. She wasn't old. She was within reach of the card. She just had to use her fingers in a certain way to get it. Did she want to piggyback on me, to avoid touching the dirty floor too?

Any other man might've tried to be chivalrous and aid her, but I've been wary around young woman. I don't find much criminal reports about them, and a lot of the known reports seem to portray them as innocent. But I know women, like humans and animals, have the capacity to prey on others. A society that fails to report or publish such predation doesn't affect that predation's exist. If nobody told me about gravity, then that doesn't mean that I won't fall off a cliff.

"Why is it that so many young girls (and boys) acknowledge feminism is bad, yet say it's ok for men and boys to be mistreated because ""we've done it for thousands of years""","I've talked to a lot of people in school, and a lot of them (mainly the girls) tend to say they agree that boys have it harder in society, but it's our fault because we've been ""oppressing women for the past thousand of years"" and this is what we have to deal with. I argued back ""it's not our fault it happened"" (even though now I know perfectly well that women were **never oppressed**) and she said ""well it doesn't affect me so I don't care""

The problem with so many of these younger to-be feminists is that they're just taking this ""victim"" attitude like everyone in the world somehow owes them something, and then they grow up to be these nasty, toxic, man-hating feminists who deny all bad things women do in the world yet say stuff like ""men are natural born rapists"".

marrying,"One way to stave off sexual predators is by having a wife.

But what if she has extramarital sex? Imagine living with a woman who contracts herpes or other new or random STIs from other men that can be passed onto me, even without my having sex with her. Living with her would shorten my lifespan rather than extend it, which the latter was the goal in avoiding sexual predators.

Why did she marry me if she's going to have extramarital sex? How can I make sure that I don't marry a sexual predator, especially when I barely have any connections with childhood female friends?

What if she wrongfully initiates divorce, using it as a tool to take resources from me? I've read of men who have been divorce-raped. Maybe I can read laws protecting me from such wrongful divorce but she can always fabricate evidence, documents, and witness. And I could lose children! My mom and dad divorced, and my mom took all three children. I can't imagine losing a child, even to a predator. Remarrying after divorce is believed to be near adultery, so I might not ever rightfully recover.

I could initiate a divorce in many situations, but I feel such divorce is shameful under Christianity. And again, remarrying is like near adultery. Outside of Christianity, my resources would likely be taken away too.

If I do decide to marry, for the sake of staving off sexual predators, then I'd need to be careful with whom I marry. I probably shouldn't rush marriage. I can probably find local marriage and divorce statistics to review the longevity of some marriages in my society.",3,0,['marrying'],marrying

prostitution watch,"Prostitution is illegal here, but some local prostitutes still try to trick men into buying diseases and being robbed. Some local prostitutes get really desperate for resources too, and would stalk and prey on any man; just as a hungry animal would eat any prey when starving. Some prostitutes can even make use of a man's life, in the event that he has no resources to steal.

Before leaving home, I forgot to carry my defense against female predators and prostitutes. But since I was already out the door, I didn't bother to turn back to carry the defense. What's the worst that could happen?

While observing nature, I crossed by some woman who seemed pretty normal. But then I remembered that I was walking in an area far from the buildings, cars, and roads. It was in the area that I came across two people who appeared to be having sex and tried to communicate with me, so I became alert.

After a while, I looked back and she had turned around as if she were stalking me.

She was wearing bright colors, maybe to visually attract prey. She was wearing tight jeans that had rips showing black pants or leggings underneath. Why would anyone wear such revealing pants during the cold winter?

Maybe she was an ordinary woman. But when she passed by me again, quite soon after our first encounter, she didn't appear to have shoes. She was stepping on the mud with black socks, even stepping in a puddle. It was not a usual sight. Maybe she wasn't sober.

Maybe she needed help, but she should've asked me for help. She's an adult and has the capacity to seek help. I'm not falling for that ""women are innocent"" or ""women are easily frightened by men"" crap. Women are adults and need to act as such. And I'm not letting my guard down simply because of gender. A female bear can eat a man just as gruesomely as a male bear can.

I would not be surprised if she was a prostitute. Through the way she was dressed, her distance away from witnesses, and her proximity near me; her being a prostitute/predator was pretty obvious. There were also two men further up the park trail that she was walking up. I don't commonly see two men working out together at that area.

I'm happy that I kept my distance from her, though I really didn't like her proximity near me. It was an ugly and unpleasant sight. I really should've carried my defense, to keep her away. Well, I learned my lesson.",2,0,"['prostitution', 'watch']",prostitution watch

"I really hate it when someone says ""teach men not to *insert violent crime*"", ""toxic masculinity*, and any other buzzy words.","This post is a rant.

I don't mind if I'm a gay man, I'm just also one of the brothers that I'm fighting for!

It's really annoying when someone could pull out t34©H m3N n0T T0 *insert violent crime, ex: rape, pervert, etc.

The context in there is misandristic and it's flawed.
The phrase is often generally implied. The only subject in the context is ""men"".

Teach men not to *insert violent crime. Why though? Do men do that unless they are taught? Even that phrase makes seem the violent crime normalised at the first place.

The criminal be like ""jeez, am I doing bad even though I'm matured enough to understand and know what I'm doing? I have to stop though, thanks for reminding""

Blames the crime is only to men and erases female sexual abusers too.

-------

The mainstream's view regarding masculinity is extremely misleaded. As they see masculinity is only bad stuff like crime and boys can't cry.

And annoyingly, when some guy just did wrong by their personal situation, and that guy happened to be a man, people will blame, toxic masculinity, that it just generalizes men's nature that they do those stuff. I think it's a False Equivalence fallacy, comparing a male criminal, to a male who's just eating ramen at the afternoon with his son, and happened to be both men, assumed that they have the same nature.

The term ""toxic masculinity"" was only originated by the mythopoetic men's movement(1980s and 1990s), which is advocating for self-help and therapy for men. The term became widespread in 2010 when the popular writings, media, and the mainstream has been using the term to refer masculine norms.

You can't remove violence, rigorous ambition, and competence into the male psyche, and that doesn't mean it's bad. It's males' biological instincts, and forcing something to remove at its natural state doesn't do good, it will just cause inappropriation, annoyance, irritate, and ignorance.

The violence can be used to good to fight tyranny like the army, instead of unnecessarily hurt people.

The rigourous ambition that make guys do risky stuff can be harnessed to do heroic actions.

The competence and greed of males can be useful for building economies and sports, rather than cheating.

You can't make good men by making them less men.
You can't make good men, by taking the ""men"" away.
They become good if they stop doing the bad.

Masculinity is not toxic, it's just by how you use it.

What is the biggest problem facing father's today?,"I'm going to argue that it is the division of labour in the home, it is the fact that so many of us fathers feel not just the need to provide for our families, but the obligation that it is solely our duty to make sure the rent/mortgage is paid, that food is on the table and that our kids have access to the resources they need to make it into adulthood as a well balanced, healthy and productive adult themselves.

That should not be the case, the third wave of feminism we are in right now has rightfully championed for women's equality in the workplace, however that same movement actively works against mens equality in the home, while the traditional gender roles at work have been crashing down for 50 year's, the same has not happened for the traditional gender roles at home, both for legislation and societies expectations, and there is a good reason for this.

It is cheaper for our government.

Our government knows that men have been conditioned for hundreds or thousands of years to be the sole income earner in the home, and we do that because we want the best for our families, and that fact it used against us, one of the primary metrics used by the court for who get's primary custody is ""who has been the primary caregiver before separation"" and of course because we want to work and provide for our families, that is the mother.

because we want to provide for our families, our spouses don't have to work, they don't have to grow a career and they end up doing the work at home with our children.

And that's where they have us, during separation our lawmakers know that we can make money, because we have been for years, and they know that it takes money to raise children, so they can get us twice, first they make sure that the mother of our children get primary care of the kids, they know that they have been at home not growing a career for year's, and so cant earn as much, so we pay child support, they know that we will have to work more, and so we will pay more tax, while also subsidising our kids mother through child support, they know that if we get primary care or even 50/50 they will not get as much tax revenue, and will have to support both parents even if its what's best for the children.

So how do we combat this? simply put WE can't, those of us that are already in this situation are going to be stuck in it, as long as the cycle continues like this it's going to stay the same.

But what we can do is try our best to teach our sons, and the young adults in out lives to be careful who they have children with, I think that it's great the women have been given greater access to the workplace, but in order for us to have greater access to our children we have to hold our partners to that, we have to be selective about who we have children with and make sure they are contributing to our families finances well before children are involved, and more importantly we have to make sure that WE are involved in our households and the raising of our children.

If we want change so that we are involved with our children after separation, we must make sure we are involved with our children before as well.",7,0,"['What', 'is', 'the', 'biggest', 'problem', 'facing', 'father', 's', 'today']",What is the biggest problem facing father's today?

The second article is about a prostitute who uses a male accomplice, I believe. As always, the man gets arrested and the woman (true culprit) is acquitted or ignored.

If you look for news articles or information concerning prostitutes online, you are going to get a lot of sex worker advocacy or prostitution victimization (or highlighting prostitutes who get hurt by men rather than men who get hurt by prostitutes' STIs or prostitutes' crime schemes.) It's sad to live in a society that defends pathological and criminal predators but punishes their infected or robbed victims. Some people, like my own brother, even victim-blame male victims by saying they are dumb for hiring the prostitutes in the first place. Oh boy, I'm happy that prostitution is illegal where I live: some man has common sense here.

But some articles are encouraging me to do some prostitute-busting on my own. It'd be nice to keep those predators from giving hiv and other diseases to local working men. In the beginning, I might start by busting stray prostitutes before those who use male accomplices.

On the dangers of hooking up with women.,"I stumble on this post https://np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/kxs5gp/quarantine_revealed_something_nasty_about_dating/

Apparently, many women are afraid of unfamiliar men. And they have every right to be - though I don't know if murderers really use dating apps to find victims. And if they do, what are the chances to end up with one?

Anyway, that got me thinking about the occasions when women have tricked me or my friends. 

When I was in my early 20s I travelled a lot in Europe, sometimes alone sometimes with friends. Once I in a railway station in Hamburg waiting for the train, my friend left with a young woman. I didn't know what was going on but later on I found out that she had led him to a room where he got robbed. When he started asking about his wallet, a couple of men entered the room. Luckily, my friend manged to escape. This was early on on our Interrail, but he had to return home having lost most of his money. 

Once in Ibiza I went to a bar - or perhaps it was a nigh club - with a friend. A couple of ladies came to sit with us and asked if we could buy them drinks. You have to remember that we were about 20-year-old guys from Finland. Anyway, I warned my friend against it but he was a rich guy, a drunk rich guy, and ordered drinks anyway. When we got the bill the sum was something so insane that even my friend started to get second thoughts. So, we left for the toilet and managed to get out - though there was some sort of strange curtain labyrinth between the toilet and front door -  and then jumped into a car we had rented and drove away as fast as we could. The only time I have driven while heavily under the influence. 

The first time this pattern emerged on my travels was in Athens where I was without company. Nothing terrible happened but the experience was a bit  scary - and educational. A girl about my age started talking with me in the street. She seemed very nice and seemed to be interested in me. After a while she asked if I wanted to go to a café with her. She led me to this murky place without customers and left immediately after I had sat down. Three older, shady-looking men sat down with me and just stared at me talking to each other in a language I didn't recognize. Without thinking I got up, my heart pounding, mumbled something about leaving, and left. Whatever the plan had been they let me go. (Later on I have learned that you should not act like a victim in a situation like that but show self-assurance. Perhaps I did that without thinking about it by not staying but leaving immediately.) 

Anyway, it's a pattern, attractive women targeting young and drunk men and leading them to potentially dangerous situations. As you all probably know already - though I really didn't when I was young. 

Boys and young men should also be at least a bit afraid of women. Also on dating apps.",168,0,"['On', 'the', 'dangers', 'of', 'hooking', 'up', 'with', 'women']",On the dangers of hooking up with women.

As of right now, I do not know when I will be able to return to this project and want to extend my deepest apologies to the community. The delay was unforeseen and unfortunate, and I will shorten it the best I can.

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you wondering how far I've gotten, the data has been mostly cleaned and is getting organized into jamovi, where progression should be a lot smoother. Once the transfer is done, all we need to do is run an analysis and go over the results. These will be posted to the sub and things will progress normally from there.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, I want to thank you all for your patience and understanding. I will likely be away for a bit while I resolve things at home, but your voices and insights are valued and I look forward to hearing from you when I return. Until then, please take care, stay safe, and I hope to see you again soon.",1,0,"['Survey', 'Update']",Survey Update

"Crazy idea, but should ""making oneself dependent"" also be considered domestic abuse?","So I know a lot of people think domestic violence law in the UK is kinda crazy. ""Controlling"" is extremely vague - if I'm being attacked by a wild dog then I'm trying to control it if I pry its jaws open ... I think it essentially relies on an implicit ""reasonableness"" criteria and I've never heard of a couple have a mess break-up where they considered the other to be reasonable. 

Anyhow ...

Scottish legislation includes ""making B dependent on, or subordinate to, A"". For example, forcing a woman to stop work so she relies on the man for income.

However, surely the inverse is also controlling. If I break my legs or quit my job or make myself dependent in some other way, this would put my SO in a very precarious position - I've put them in a situation when they can't leave without causing a lot of harm. This would be especially difficult if alimony was at play.

&gt; The relevant effects are of—

&gt; (a)making B dependent on, or subordinate to, A,

&gt; (b)isolating B from friends, relatives or other sources of support,

Why the stereotypical view of men is so negative,"This is inspired by from Roy Baumeister's *Is there anything good about men?*

Men,  compared to women, are at the extremes of almost any Bell curve that measures human traits (if there is natural variance and the averages of the sexes are close to each other - like they often are). So, there are, for example, more geniuses and retards among men than among women. 

Furthermore, we humans have this tendency to notice and remember things that are out of the ordinary, the dog bites man kind of stories. And because men are at the extremes we tend to find these extraordinary stories about men much more often than about women. It's much more likely that the richest people are men rather than women. Or violent thugs.

And because we the confirmation bias - we look and see evidence that supports our prejudices - we can easily become convinced that men are successful and evil while women aren't.

But why is successful negative? There are a lot of people who think that success is somehow dubious to begin with. Furthermore, Feminism has managed to tell people that the success men enjoy has not been achieved fairly.

So we see and remember men who are morally disgusting.",4,0,"['Why', 'the', 'stereotypical', 'view', 'of', 'men', 'is', 'so', 'negative']",Why the stereotypical view of men is so negative

"One more reason why wage gap is a ""statistical error"" (from Roy Baumeister's Is there anything good about men?)","The book is really good (though he sometimes doesn't know all the relevant facts but who would). His point: 

&gt; There is a legal minimum wage. Of course, even if the legal minimum wage were not a factor, there would still be the de facto minimum of zero. Nobody works for a negative salary. A negative salary would mean, essentially, that if you were really incompetent you would pay the company to let you work for them.
&gt; 
&gt; Again assume that the average inputs are exactly the same for men and women: the same qualifications, the same abilities, the same efforts and sacrifices. Assume the average man and woman produce exactly the same quality and quantity of work. And assume that there are more men at both extremes.
&gt; 
&gt; There may be a minimum salary, but there is no maximum. And so at the high extreme, the top-achieving men can pull up the men’s average salary. Meanwhile, at the low end, the floor (the minimum wage and the zero point) prevents the low-achieving men from pulling the male average back down. As a result, men’s average salary will end up higher than women’s—even if the average man is precisely equal to the average woman on every single factor that determines salary.

Futhermore he argues that the same mechanism affects grades:

&gt; In many college classes, the majority of students get A grades. Failure is increasingly rare.
&gt; 
&gt; The highest possible grade in most colleges, or what statisticians call the ceiling, is an A. The lowest (the floor) is an F. Over the last couple of decades, all grades have drifted upward toward the ceiling. The floor is far from the average, and the ceiling is close to it.
&gt; 
&gt; The low ceiling will affect the average grades of men and women.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember, we have more men at both extremes of actual achievement.
&gt; 
&gt; The really high achieving men, however, can no longer pull up the male average, because of the low ceiling. There is no grade above an A. (Curiously, many universities do not even permit A plus grades.) Lots of people get A’s. And so the super-brilliant students get the same grade (A) as the moderately bright and conscientious ones.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, though, the low-achieving males will pull the male average down. There are more men than women getting the really low grades, and as these stand out more and more because of grade inflation, they will exert a strong downward pull on the men’s average.
&gt; 
&gt; The result? Women will get better grades than men, on average.",5,0,"['One', 'more', 'reason', 'why', 'wage', 'gap', 'is', 'a', 'statistical', 'error', 'from', 'Roy', 'Baumeister', 's', 'Is', 'there', 'anything', 'good', 'about', 'men']","One more reason why wage gap is a ""statistical error"" (from Roy Baumeister's Is there anything good about men?)"
My school experience,"This happened to me in school.

The teacher was an absolute PoS. Generally she was incompetent and disliked, but here is one particular incident involving her.

In our school, it was the practice to stand up and wish the teacher when she entered. Most teachers would wish back- Good morning, children- or something like that. This particular teacher would say ""Good morning, girls"". Reason being that ""Boys behave badly"". She would also ignore any doubts/questions asked by boys, scold boys and let off girls for the same mistakes and had an obvious bias while marking papers.

So one day, we(boys) decided to *not* wish the teacher- why should we, when she disregards us completely? So we did that.

She, predictably, got furious, as we 'disrespected' her. The matter went to the principal and she(principal) initially was very angry but became softer after she heard our point of view. The teacher was reprimanded and we were let off with a ceremonial warning.

I stumbled upon the above document tonight, and didn't expect to have been so effected by it. As a victim of child sexual abuse, reading through the above sentiments really fucking hurt me. I don't have anything, no one really to depend on for emotional clarity but myself; which is more or less the point I suppose, I spent so many years denying the pain of a secret I was waiting for permission to let myself in on. Reading through these guidelines made me feel as though I were back before I no longer had the choice of denial, before I was able to free myself from the burden of absolute responsibility for everything I experience, before I realized that existing as I am and feeling how I feel doesn't make me a monster like him; I spent my entire adolescence painting new masks for every occasion, every clique, every moment. Everything was fine so long as I managed to be anything but Myself. But charades is a party game, and suffice it to say, the party ended when loneliness and isolation set upon my every moment. All that time spent acting, like characters in a vapid sitcom. It's no wonder I remember so very little before my 18th birthday, there simply never was anything real to remember; how could I have been so content to live as little more than a means by which to satisfy the situational approval of others? I let myself down, and lost 10 years of my life as a consequence, not to mention all those ""friends"" I spent so much time pleasing and trying to impress. Frankly, I don't want to do that to myself any longer, regardless of whatever people may think of me, I need to vindicate myself against this strange fucking contempt I've shown for myself. So honestly fuck it, why should I second guess my desire to standup on behalf of my own experiences and feelings?

These are emotional claims, though I could certainly condemn them empirically also, however, in this instance, I feel uniquely justified in just being fucking angry about these ""best practices"".

How the fuck do these people find it remotely appropriate, or necessary to teach boys why doing harm to other is wrong? As if I couldn't possibly understand what it feels like to be violated, to be voided of trust and security, to be hurt and to keep being hurt and feel it's okay because no one ever told you it wasn't? As if the only way for my own experiences to matter is dependent on it's relevance to the well-being of others? How fucking dare these people presume the authority to insist upon what my obligations should be, and how exactly it is I ought to behave.

Anyone who is capable of selectively defining a boy's trauma in their own adulterated words for purposes which benefit ANYONE but the boy whose trauma they are addressing, without even bothering to pretend as though they have his interest at heart (god forbid, as a fucking priority), is clearly a deeply immoral person. Why should I matter any less than anyone else? What the fuck gives them the sense that's it's okay to assert MY complicity in the perpetuation of the very violence to which I was victim? Fuck these people. Honestly, I'm done being nice about this, if they want to make me the enemy of their perfidious cult, fine, whatever the fuck it takes to prevent them from doing further harm to innocent boys on the basis of THEIR OWN PROJECTIONS. I am not responsible for the falsehoods, biases, and down right hateful opinions of others. This has to stop. Insisting that boy's are somehow complicit in a system WHICH DOES NOT EVEN EXIST by using satire-worthy double-speak terms like, ""compassionate accountability"", is simply an unacceptable way to treat children.

I felt disgusting, ashamed, and monstrous even without the help of feminist indoctrination, had I been taught to accept those feelings perpetuated largely by MY trauma as realities intrinsic to my identity as a boy? The self-hatred I suffer was once so intense that I fell into a habit of scaring myself with searing metal-tweezers; had I been made to internalize the voice of this document, I'm confident the extent of my self-harm would have fair surpassed merely a wrist covered in burn scars.

Statements like this one:

&gt;Is the program focused on building empathy while not devaluing women or reinforcing the idea that men need to protect women? Does it acknowledge and respect the harms men themselves may have experienced without losing focus on the harms they may have perpetuated?

And

&gt;Does the program create a safe place for men and boys to understand their roles and responsibilities in ending violence? Are safe spaces created for diverse men and boys to learn, reflect, and change?

Seriously? How fucking stupid do they think males are to accept this shit? These feminist ideologues go OUT OF THEIR WAY to clarify that the ONLY reason they're aren't stating, in plain terms, that which they believe is not out of a concern for boys\` well-being. Of course not. Rather, the use of meaningless jargon is employed so as to ""facilitate this process in compassionate ways in order to prevent disengagement, resentment, and backlash"", as opposed to the myriad potential harms this psychopathic conspiracy theory is likely to cause a boy in terms of shame, self-hatred, alienation, and absolute demoralization.

Just a final message to anyone capable of looking through the document and not finding it shockingly appalling, and indeed akin to a form of compulsory psychological child-abuse: no, I DO NOT acknowledge my male privilege; no, I AM NOT complicit in an imaginary system you believe to have been created by boys and men for the purpose of abusing women and girls; no, I DO NOT need your approval as a victim of sexual abuse; no, YOU DO NOT get to claim responsibility for my own sense of morality; no, I DO NOT owe restitution to anyone for existing as I have always done: innocently.

If I were capable of submitting to this nonsense, and somehow retained some iota of rationality, I wouldn't waste time in discussions of my ""male privilege"" (whatever the fuck that even means). Nor would I waste my time digging deeper into my cognitive dissonance regarding the illusion that feminism in its current form actually cares about my well-being, I'd simply accept the claim being offered: even in treating a traumatized boy, the goal is not to help him, merely it is to mitigate the threat he poses to women and girls; males are obstacles at best, and threats at worst, and the traumatized one's pose an even greater threat, thus as the well-being of boys and men was never a concern, the absolute most feminist action a male can take is suicide. Right? We're not going to talk about realities. Like the fact that 80% of suicide victims are male, or that 1/6 isn't a particularly dissimilar proportion to 1/4, or any other issue which shows males as a population in clear need of help. We only discuss male mental health after the latest school shooting, that is: another incident of a mass-murder suicide. What the fuck am I to make of that except to say that we clearly don't mind suicides in which the sole victim is also the perpetrator, in fact, we might prefer it when men and boys take their lives, provided he does it out of sight, so as to avoid subjecting potential witnesses to the burden of his last failure.

While it's true the awareness to the fact that, contrary to popular belief, men and boys do feel pain and they do suffer, has risen through the years, I cannot help but feel I'd prefer silence to an awareness which castigates me as an accessory to be used. I'd much prefer to be treated as invisible than to be treated as dangerous. To be treated as damaged and THEREFORE dangerous is beyond what I can handle. Time and time again, the world makes itself clear to me: it doesn't care about ME, and when it appears to, I'll never need to look very hard before I find the catch. I feel demoralized, maligned, and willfully misunderstood; if I could pretend not to feel I would, but I can't do that when someone else's words reveal the truth that indeed I do feel, but does so only in order to redefine those feelings in service of it's own goal.",23,0,"['To', 'those', 'who', 'subscribe', 'to', 'feminism', 'you', 'can', 't', 'expect', 'me', 'not', 'to', 'shiver', 'after', 'a', 'life', 'in', 'the', 'cold', 'I', 'm', 'done', 'acquiescing', 'to', 'being', 'treated', 'like', 'something', 'you', 're', 'entitled', 'to', 'control']",To those who subscribe to feminism: you can't expect me not to shiver after a life in the cold.

"I hate how people are able to laugh at and make jokes about male genital mutilation or support any form of male genital mutilation and emasculation, and no one makes a big deal about it!","It seems like the number of radical feminists who laugh at and make jokes about male genital mutilation or support any form of male genital mutilation and emasculation are growing.

Not too long ago, I was reading comments on YouTube about circumcision, and I found a comment suggesting having boys castrated after birth.

Here's what the person said in their comment:

**""I think castration on boys shortly after birth should be legal and should be a option made by the parents like how circumcision is. Think about it, a lot of women's lives would be better and safer if most men were castrated, since less women would get raped or murdered and they wouldn't get harassed and stalked by men, and they wouldn't be sexualized in the media and in fiction all the time. Also men tend to be violent because of their testosterone level, so there would be less violence in the world if most men were castrated. And also, if most men were castrated, they also would do better in schools and behave more better. So I think societies would be a way better place if most men were castrated.**

**And also, the idea I have in order for women to still get pregnant is that have the men who are not castrated paid large amounts of money to donate sperm at sperm banks. Or we can start creating artificial sperm or find another way to get women pregnant without the need of sperm.""**

I think the person's comment got deleted since I can't find it. But recently I stumbled upon another comment that is similar, but the main thing that was different with the comment was that instead of castration, the person was suggesting that the whole glans of a boy's penis should be amputated shorty after birth. And like with the castration comment, the comment actually received a couple of likes, and some people commented back, saying that they agree with it.

As I said, it seems like our society now thinks that nearly all men are bad, when it's actually only very few men out of the whole male population. It now seems like our society is now a misandrist society.

Even if these are just jokes, they are a very fucked up thing to say. Circumcision is already bad enough, we don't need worse stuff like castration and amputating the glans of the penis to start happening.

"Poll: Politically, I'm wondering about the balance of the Men's Rights subreddit or MRA movement. Does this group truly cross the aisle or is it one sided?","Sorry if this has been directly addressed. I searched through for a similar post and didn't find one being direct.

Politically, in the US especially, the idea of men's rights appears to be one sided. With one side ""advocating"" for it and being called misogynistic if they do and the other embracing the ideology of feminism and toning down masculinity to atone for perceived past transgressions, it seems you can't share the MRA belief across lines. 

I'd like to believe this crosses all walks of life, regardless of race, politics, religion (excluding overtly gender biased believers) or other uniquely defining characteristic. Fighting for your children, your physical and mental welfare and ensuring you have an open and non-judgemental support system along with an equal voice to women in all aspects should be a right for all men.

Since Men's Rights are about mental well being, equality in outcome given an even playing field and addressing glaring issues with the declining performance and health of boys and men, I'd hope this is more than an echo chamber for one side.

I see the average kid knows that the wage gap is fake...,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1Onniy08AY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1Onniy08AY)

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see from this video, the majority of kids know that the gender wage gap is **FAKE AND BS**. It's only the kids that have been raised by feminist parents or been taught fake feminist beliefs in school that believe this nonsense.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a fact that women shop more and do a lot of other things while men are physically stronger and are better at sticking to a single task than women, and A LOT OF KIDS ACKNOWLEDGE THIS. It's not until feminists start saying ""Gender is a 'social construct' and women and men are completely equal"" that these kid's minds are screwed up.

&amp;#x200B;

Many feminists will argue that it is these kids that are not ""educated"" enough, yet there is clear proof here by even some kids who **see the real world and see the work place** that it is common sense that the gender wage gap is **COMPLETELY BS.**

Liberal MRAs,"Many years ago I assumed all MRAs were extreme right-wingers due to all the feminist and media propaganda. I’ve always been liberal/left-wing and value fairness and egalitarianism, and when i learned of all the ways men are treated unfairly in the legal system and how society has embraced narratives about the “patriarchy” that are unfair to men, my liberal instincts lead me to embrace MRA ideas. Does anyone else have this experience? I embraced feminism before because of all the stories of how society is unfair to women, but that value of fairness led me to the MRA sphere when i started doing some research and stopped blindly listening to feminist talking-points",58,0,"['Liberal', 'MRAs']",Liberal MRAs

&gt;French blogger Pauline Harmange admits that she hates all men.

(when at most knows a handful)

&gt;She received a torrent of online abuse.

(not evidenced)

But what follows is just, I have just got no words...

&gt;**Toni Warrior says she doesn't trust men at all**  
&gt;  
&gt;Life was great between us. Then last Christmas, after we had been seeing each other for three months, he announced that he wasn’t sure if he could take on another bloke’s child.

Because you are not entitled to demanding people take care of kids that are not theirs.

&gt;HE LED ME ON WITH FALSE HOPE  
&gt;  
&gt;But after another two months he told me it was over – he couldn’t accept my daughter. He led me on with false hope and absolutely broke my heart. I was just blind to the fact he wouldn’t be a stepdad.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here I am, almost 30, and living with my parents. Mum and Dad have been together for 31 years and my brother with his girlfriend for 13 years.

A single mother at 30 blinding to the fact that singlemomness most likely means you can't have a relationship.

Should learn from her brother.

&gt;I recently approached a guy when I was out with the girls. He looked me up and down and said, “Babes, you’re not my level – I don’t talk to anyone who isn’t earning thousands a week”.

Respect for that guy's sense of irony!

&gt;Another guy tried to stop me from eating lunch, telling me to have coffee instead, otherwise I’d end up fat. I was shocked and thought he was joking. He wasn’t.

Basic sense of health, well being and care for people is no joke.

&gt;That’s why I just don’t trust men at all. Guys are in relationships for one reason only.

I can think of one, finding a decent lady willing to put some effort on something... that reason let you out.

The rest is hilarious as well...",30,0,"['OH', 'MAN', 'They', 'cheat', 'walk', 'out', 'on', 'you', 'or', 'just', 'want', 'sex', 'why', 'we', 'hate', 'men']","OH MAN They cheat, walk out on you or just want sex – why we hate men"

Why the resistance to make responsibility gender-equal?,"Let's be painfully honest: today a female points your finger at you publicly, then cries/screams/accuses at you, depending on the intensity of the action you are doomed: jailed, beaten, or at least restrained to be arrested. That's a huge lot of power from a class that's supposedly oppressed.

It's extremely worrying that people influenced by feminism appear to do anything possible to prevent that privilege from changing, and it's hard to tell if it's plainly because of too much ideology or simply certain people to remain in certain power...

For example, I think it's very profitable to run organizations where people are paid to “address misogyny”. What's the incentive to combat something whose very existence means I get paid a huge salary? (people in these organizations usually have higher-class-life enabling salaries)

why all men are sexual.,"(This is a conversation I just had on some online chat support website. Since some women seem to always complain about men being sexual, I decided to text some woman to try to help understand the issue.)

Female: Hey there. Welcome. What brings you here?

Me: I am a male fighting intimate thoughts. I need to remember that bare intimacy in a bedroom is dangerous for me.

Female: Could you give me a reason why you think this is a problem?

Me: Wait, you don't know sex is dangerous?

Female: Too much of anything addicting counts as an addiction and we all know addictions don't end well. But what gives you the impression sex is dangerous for you? Has anything led to this?

Me: I've received a lot of sex education. So you'd have sex with anyone?

Female: Personally, I wouldn't. But we are all human and we are made to be intimate. It's how nature makes us reproduce. I'm assuming given that question, you would? Correct me if I'm wrong.

Me: No I wouldn't. And you wouldn't too. Because it's dangerous. It's like saying ""I don't jump into fire, but you can do it."" Do you think I'm that stupid?

Female: It can be yes. But it's not life threatening. There's certain limits to be taken. Sex can lead to consequences that are dangerous. The act itself isn't much so. 

Me: oh ok, well thanks for taking 9 minutes to finally accept that sex is dangerous, which was a fact I had already started the convo with. I literally started the convo with that fact, and we had to waste 9 minutes to reconfirm it.

Female: So you're saying sex is dangerous and you want to avoid intimate thoughts. I'm not saying I disagree with your statement but I don't agree to all of it. Sex isn't a bad thing, if you don't control yourself and there's a mutual understanding between everyone involved, it's ok.

Me: So if I have sex with someone under mutual agreement, and then get hiv, its ok.

I am not a misogynist but... (A Chilean SIMP comic),"Two years ago, the Chilean author Damivago published a comic titled: “I am not a mysoginist but...”

This comic had certain appraisal on networks like Twitter. It indistinctly depicts men in demeaning way, supposedly telling stories of men that under negation of their own misogyny still act creepily towards women. This comic has a huge level of projection coming from the author, apparently.

GF Pregnant,"Topic: GF Pregnant due in July. No plans to get married or live together. State Florida 

Goal: Establish paternity, establish fathers right, come to a paternity agreement i.e. how many nights each parent gets. Calculated CS and get and in the system and start paying. 

I've gone thru one divorce so I have an idea how the legal system kind of works in Florida but this one is a little different. GF is pregnant right now and the goal right now is to have a healthy child. We talked about how things would work and typical women can never get a straight answer. 

 I'm wondering at one point I need to seek legal advise. I think a one hour paid consultation now would probably answer some questions now, but its probably way to early to pay a retainer. 

Based on my research, when the child is born. I can be listed as the father on the birth certificate, that doesn't really mean anything. I may be asked to sign a voluntary paternity  acknowledgement, that's a big NO. Ideally we would work together on a paternity agreement that includes a paternity test to just be 100%. My guess she will balk at it. 

So what's next? hire a lawyer and serve her with papers? At the time of the birth she will on Medicaid, she has a job and income, but she was able to sign up durn the covid shut down no questions asked. My research says if your on assistance which includes Medicaid she has to help the State locate the father an establish paternity. So I may get a free test there. But they don't get involved in timesharing or other parent issues. 

So what do you think fellas? not looking to avoid anything. Just wanted to be ahead of the ball and pay my fair share and be part of the Childs life. Am I overthinking this or will the pieces fall in place. What are some pitfalls to watch out for?",14,0,"['GF', 'Pregnant']",GF Pregnant

Munsnet (UK) - avoid like the plague!! Biased Moderators.,"A few months ago, my wife initiated a divorce. Obviously this was an upsetting time for me, so in order to get a woman's perspective.

* I was told in no uncertain times:
* I would lose all of my assets
* I wouldn't see my child at all.
* If the wife couldn't afford the remaining mortgage, I would be 'locked in' for the next 14+ years to paying the mortgage and having that debt hanging over me to prevent me buying/renting again.

**As it turns out that advice was bollocks.**

In reality:

* I gave 60% of the equity of the House in cash (more, based on her being the primary caregiver).
* I retained the marital home.
* I gained 3/7 nights and a good proportion of the holidays giving me 3+ nights per year (important for childcare as well as child maintenance costs).
* My pension, as it was largely pre-marital, I gave her 20% of the pot.

So, I went back, politely to leave a comment on the site. The idea was to leave a post, so future men can see what the reality is like, in accordance to Section 25 of the Matrimonial Act.

As you can imagine, I was immediately beset by screaming banshee's on the site. Some posters were reasonable, other's indulged in 'fantasy roleplay' claiming:

* I must have a small dick.
* I would forever be alone.
* Other inane baiting.

The moderators, acting in accordance to the leanings of the site deleted the thread, hoping to gaslight  men in similiar situations.

There are radical feminists who think that the world would be a better place if all men were gone or at least if the male population was reduced to ten percent. What's your opinion on that?,"How would the world be a better place if all men were gone? 

A lot of women tend to think that all men are bad just because of the crime statuses. U.S Department of Justice homicide statistics 1980-2008  Of all homicide victims, 76.8% were men and 23.2% were women. 67.8% of those homicides it was male on male crime. 21% was male on female crime. The rest of 11.2% is female on female crime and female on male crime. 

Just because most violent criminals are men, it doesn't mean most men are like that.

Here's a quote from radical feminist **Sally Miller Gearhart**: **""\`Why have any men at all?' wrote Sally Miller Gearhart in a 1982 manifesto titled \`The Future–If There Is One–Is Female.'  Gearhart is an advocate of ovular merging, a process that involves the mating of two eggs, which has been successfully accomplished with mice.  Only female offspring are produced.  I've always worried that one day women would figure out how to get along without us and they would be able to reproduce unilaterally, like sponges.  It's not genocide, exactly. It's more like job attrition, the way employers cut back positions without actually firing anyone.  \`A 75 per cent female to 25 percent male ratio could be achieved in one generation if one half of a population reproduced heterosexually and one half by ovular merging.' according to Gearhart.  \`Such a prospect is attractive to women who feel that if they bear sons, no amount of love and care and non-sexist training will save those sons from culture where male violence is institutionalized.'""**

Sally Miller Gearhart has a theory that the only way to save the world is to reduce the number of men to ten percent of the total population.

I think I just solved a bit of the problem with abortion,"This popped in my head and I just put it into writing as quick as possible but still.

If the father doesn't want to take care of the child he can sign something before the birth that means he is not the father (it would basically mean that he wouldn't be the father in the eyes of the court and wouldn't be responsible for the child. If he wants to he can still be involved with the child but in the eyes of the government he wouldn't be a parent, meaning that if the mother wants the child she can take it and the father cant do anything about it). If the father wanted to be the father than he would still have to sign something that would mean he is the father of the child and in that case everything would remain the same as it is now. If the father knowingly abandons the mother of the child before birth than he will be listed as the father and would have to pay child support and all the other stuff. However if the father is not informed about the fact that the mother is pregnant with his child and is only informed after the birth than he does not have to take care of the child in any way. In this case the father can still sign the thing (contract?) that makes him the father in the eyes of the government without input of the mother. The mother can also sign away their responsibility of the child to the father (this must also be done before the birth and if done after birth the father must be in agreement otherwise the mother must pay child support). All of these can be signed after the birth as long as both the father and mother are in agreement. If both the father and mother do not want the child they will then be allowed to have an abortion or the baby will be put up for adoption after birth.

My experience with the difficulties of feminist men's communities,"Let me start off by saying I have been an active feminist for decades, but over the last 5-10 years my interest in men's issues has grown. I think feminism has been built on a solid foundation and developed a lot of useful tools and concepts.

However the difficulty I have with feminist communities is lack of willingness to introspect or address toxicity within the community. I have been a member of /r/MensLib for quite a while now, and have heard many members discuss this problem. However, these posts are almost always deleted.

For me the last straw has been recently. About a month ago I made a thread discussing the issue, but it was swiftly closed by a mod and said hat the tone was too much about feminism and not enough about men's issues. To me discrimination against men is absolutely a men's issue, and discrimination from feminists is an extremely pressing issue.

After about 3 weeks I had thought about it a lot, and discussed with many other users. At that time I decided to make a new thread, being extremely focused on the issue at hand, and making it clear my problem isn't with feminism as a whole but only with sexism.

Disappointingly, this thread was closed within a few hours. The reason the mods gave this time was that it wasn't ""concrete enough"" and a bit of ""gender war"". I sent several messages over the next week looking for clarification and to ask for help to improve the thread. This culminated when the mods made it clear: 

&gt;We don't allow posts that focus on feminism, because fundamentally feminism as a movement is not about men. There are times and places that constructive criticism of specific feminist spaces or movements can be appropriate, but when a post on our subreddit is about feminism or about experiences in feminist spaces, it inevitably winds up being unproductive and attracting a huge anti-feminist contingent, regardless of how benign the intentions were behind the post. 

This is extremely disheartening for me. The community had been built with the assertion that the focus is on men. Here is a quote from the MensLib wiki that I strongly agree with:

&gt;MensLib is a movement and community specifically to identify, discuss, and address men's issues, and to support men. Because women and women's issues are often closely related to men's issues, they often are introduced into our discussions by way of complement or contrast—but our priority is always on helping men and tackling the issues they face. 

Unfortunately, it seems that the opinion of the staff has changed since that wiki was made.

I feel I am at a great loss. I am not certain that a feminism-allied movement can truly address men's issues if their first priority is to shield feminism from criticism. I don't think that oppression of men is something that should be ignored. Although I have had many problems with the MRA community in the past, at the moment I feel it is the only men's movement that can truly address sexism in all forms.

While I think that feminism is compatible with true equality, I do not think that feminist communities can help move equality for men forward (besides standing aside and being allies). 

For reference, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/ks5yvg/struggling_with_sexism_within_our_community_at/) is the second thread, and I have pasted the OP below:

&gt;As a feminist interested in men's issues, I find one of the biggest barriers to progress is our own communities. It feels very difficult to talk about men's issues in feminist spaces, and moreover difficult to criticize problematic behavior within the community without it being reframed as either being ""anti-feminist"" or ""you just don't like that person"".  
&gt;  
&gt;In particular, I find this problem is worst when a high-profile female feminist expresses anti-male sentiments and a male feminist attempts to address the problematic behavior. In this situation the woman is defended, while the male is silenced. I think this makes the problem worse by reinforcing the idea that the problematic behavior is correct, and that those saying it isn't are just sexists. It also emboldens those who hold similar opinions. There simply isn't the community support to combat anti-male sentiment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Without the ability to address sexism within our own movement, it's difficult to imagine we can make serious progress in society at large. This is an issue I've been struggling with, and talking to both feminists interested in male issues and feminists in non-male rights communities has only made me feel less confident about my ability to combat sexism, and our movements ability to combat it.

Dear America...,"Now that the election is over, and the leftist ideological cabal - feminism, socialism, corporatism, social justice, BLM, Antifa, etc - have taken control, how long will it be until you stop blaming everything on white males?

A few more questions:

1.  How much do you want, up front, as a one-time payment for all the perceived ills?  From reparations for slavery, to sexism, racism and all the other crimes of people who have long since died?  Name your price!

2. If you refuse to take money up front as a final payment, then what are you asking for?  You just seized control on a global scale. The Oligarch's now have control, and control of all social media, all legacy media, all of the banks and banking systems, and almost everything else.  What more are you asking for? 

3. Men in the first two decades of the 21st century have paid, and paid hard, for simply being fathers and husbands. They are the sole net providers of tax dollars, and they overwhelming occupy the most dangerous job positions in the Western world- black, white, Latino and all other men. If this subjugation is not enough. What do you see as the final answer? How much more suffering will be necessary to erase the debts of our ancestors?

4. Media ridicules white males on a constant basis - all day, every day, in bizarre ways - how much ridicule will be enough? Do you have an end game here or should we expect permanent underclass status?

Many men would like simple clear answers to these questions (and others), but anyone who has insights here would be most welcome. I think most men would appreciate honest answers.


Dear Men Reading this.

I suggest you buckle up. Because the likely answers to these questions, if the left were being honest are the following:

1. We don't want to be paid off. We want men to work as long as they live, for as far into the future as we can exploit them, and we want to steal from them at will through taxation and court judgements. You will NEVER be free.

2. The subjugation of all men, everywhere for the benefit of women and the wealthy for all eternity. We want you as a permanent underclass and to shut up about it.  

3. It was never about paying off the past. We want to take what is yours and in order to get enough votes to do so, we have to make it sound like you are benefiting more than others. That riles people up and makes your very existence seem unfair.  We accomplished this. Now shut up and get back to work. Loser.

4. You as an underclass IS the end game. We are about 90% there now. Enjoy the 10% while you can.  If you are extremely good looking, or one of the wealthy elite, then you are in the top 3%. The other 7% we keep there as an example of how men have it so good, to keep the peasants from complaining.

I believe the best way to fix the issues with gender equality toward men is fixing the disparity in dating and desire,"Every man knows this, most women have so many options and most men often don’t have one. You go on a women’s tinder and she has 10 times as many matches as you have. Women are discussing with her friends at the bar about which guy to go back with, and most men are hoping one women gives them the time of day. Why is this the case? What can be done to fix this? I believe I can explain this and provide a solution.

Let’s first start with male and female biology and psychology. Women are attracted based on emotions and men are attracted based on looks. Obviously looks and how the person makes you feel matters to both men and women, but this is what it takes for men and women to decide if they would be willing to sleep with each other. This is stuff that goes back to our cavemen days. Most guys though are mediocre to clueless on how to attract a women. Women however don’t need to know how to do anything but look good. Most girls look good enough to at least have some guys hitting them up. Men are hoping just one responds. Here is the core issue with this:

Men want to win the girl over and then have her wanting to come back. Women want to be won over and then when they are, they become emotionally invested in the guy. She wants to then chase down this guy afterwards to make him hers. A perfect dating world is men can all feel confident talking to women to have options and then women can have guys that are interested they can chase and try to win over. Women still like all the attention for sure. Who wouldn’t get an ego boost with so many people wanting you. That’s why girl’s egos when it comes to dating is so high. Any person with that kind of attention will look at themselves as the prize to these people. Women hardly act on a man that chases and comes off as him needing her. 

The dating world needs an equal but different ego boost for guys and girls. Guys can feel ego boosts from getting the girl and getting her to come back for more. Women can get theirs from guys approaching and showing interest in them. A man should work to get her interested and a women should work to keep a man’s interest. The problem is, this ideal world would never be possible with the current dating disparity that exists between men and women. This disparity gives women unique power in the dating world. They can get away with what many men would consider “unattractive” qualities as compared to men. 

Zodiac signs for instance is one thing I think most guys don’t care about or flat out dislike when a girl is way too into it. If you just like it for the fun of it but understand it is not real and don’t take it seriously, that’s cool. However, there are so many girls whose personalities are shaped by their zodiac sign. That is so unattractive to me as well as most other men. I also don’t want to talk about zodiac signs online or on the first date at all. Think about it like this, unless a women said she is a big football fan, don’t talk about last nights game on the first date. To me, it is the equivalent of something to talk about in depth with your girlfriends later on in certain circumstances and not with guys you’re just meeting. The thing is, unlike men talking about “bro” stuff on the first date or in messages before meeting, women can talk about something like zodiac signs and still have interest from lots of guys. 

The main point I am trying to prove here is men can’t get away with not being the type of guy women want as compared to women who can get away with not being the kind of guy men want. If the disparity in dating did not exist, this would not exist. Men with lots of dating options will not give women with bad qualities the time of day beyond more than sex for the most part. If all men had options like how women do, we would be able to naturally reduce female toxicity in relationships the way women can with men. If no simps were out there rewarding the toxic girl, it would force her to change or suffer the fate many men out there have which is being alone. It’s bigger than just in relationships too. If nearly all men had enough options to feel confident about turning down the crazy feminists, then there would be real life punishment for the toxic viewpoints. 

I believe the end of quarantine is the time men need to make this happen and take charge. We have a unique opportunity where so many women have not been flirted with in real life for over a year and are dying for it. We as men have to get off of dating apps where women have control over whether you will even match and get a chance and just go out and talk to women in real life. I am not just talking picking up girls at bars and nightclubs, I am talking just meeting girls during the day, having fun conversations, and getting numbers to set up dates. Most men however don’t know how to properly do this because it was never taught to us. As men, I believe this is something we should all know and we need to make as mainstream as possible as fast as possible. 

Women do a great job making information about looking best for a man mainstream. Every woman knows exactly what soaps to use for reducing pimples, best makeups, etc. They all know how to look a certain way to attract men who are attracted to what they see. Men need to make information about attracting a women based on how we make her feel mainstream. I think just teaching young men from a young age in high school just how to talk to women in a very general sense when there is less pressure and women don’t even know what they want yet is how we fix this. There are so many youtube channels and course teaching all these methods and ideas to get the hottest girls and most men watching those videos just want to understand how to talk to women in general. We need to teach men the baby steps when they are babies in the dating world. 

I notice so many guys in high school or middle school either feel like it is hopeless or just don’t care and they should. The truth is, many of the guys that seem to get girls easily in college and later on in life did many cringy things in high school that would have cost them later on. As a man, you have to go through these things when you can get away with them to an extent which is high school. Many men either don’t learn the basics or don’t try to and when they really want a girl in college, everyone else is far ahead of them and they have the dating knowledge of a 16 year old. It is quite hard to become great for a 25 year old when you haven’t even approached a girl in real life before. Expecting someone to go from that to master pickup artist is crazy and unrealistic. 

So to conclude, I believe this is how the disparity can be fixed: men need to learn right now how to approach women in real life and take full advantage once quarantine is over and we need to teach high school kids to very basics so they can learn all the other things naturally through experience. We need to teach men in general how to become their best selves before they are in their 20’s and 30’s and never learned how to get women and have to play catchup which is so incredibly hard.",16,0,"['I', 'believe', 'the', 'best', 'way', 'to', 'fix', 'the', 'issues', 'with', 'gender', 'equality', 'toward', 'men', 'is', 'fixing', 'the', 'disparity', 'in', 'dating', 'and', 'desire']",I believe the best way to fix the issues with gender equality toward men is fixing the disparity in dating and desire

Definitions of Feminism,"Obviously, the dictionary definition is a smokescreen. Feminism has never been about equality. John the Other's definition would seem to pretty accurate:

”A doctrine built on the pre-supposition of victimhood of women by men as a foundation of female identity. In its goals is always the utilization of the state to forcibly redress this claimed victimization. In other words, the proxy use of violence and wealth appropriation. In whatever flavor, and variation, these two basic features are common to every doctrine using the label feminism. Feminism is therefore, a doctrine of class hatred, and violence.” (John The Other, “Why not date a feminist?” A Voice For Men, 4 June 2012.)

"Why do people automaticaly identify the topic of ""gender equality"" exclusively with feminism?","I study medicine, and beside useful subjects i also have a lot of useless faculties, one of them being sociology. For today's class, a group of my peers had to give a lecture on ""gender as an aspect of social stratification"".

If i were to prepare that lecture, i'd want to compare inequalities men and women face, how could it affect their social position, and then leave it up to the students to make up their own minds on who is more disadvantaged in our society. I figure this is the most fair and objective way to approach that topic.

Unfortunately, doing anything of sort didn't even crossed my peers' minds. Their lecture was a long, feminist rant of both real and imagined inequalities women face, that only mentioned men in context of opressors and a problem that needs to be taken care of.

There was no mention of inequalities in labor market causing men to take up more dangerous jobs, no mention of how women are given exclusive parental rights in 60% of cases opposed to 5% of men, no mention of inequality in retirement age and a system that treats men like disposable work machines, no mention of how men are forced to parttake in military and are treated like disposable within it, no mention of any other issue that men face.

"One area that feminism has failed to liberate women is around childcare. And I don't think this is a coincidence. Everything considered equal, the trade-offs that parents make greatly benefit women at the expense of men.","The focus on unpaid and emotional labor that feminists talk about actually reinforces traditional gender norms, including the providership gap, the wage gap, and the child care gap.

And while you often see feminists talk about these gender norms, it's usually only done as a way to attack men and paint it as something that harms women, which then prevents men from objecting to it and pointing out how unfair it is.

Instead of seeing this dynamic as exploitive, women everywhere use feminist rhetoric it to justify their lifestyle as ""earned"" through their unpaid and emotional labor (which is a very similar argument that traditionalists use). Men are encouraged to work and do more because their wives and girlfriends cook and clean. It's only fair that he works an extra 10 hours a week and does the yard work because she spent her time caring for him and cooking him dinner.

As a result, men don't have the social capital to say, ""this isn't fair, I think you need to work more, and let me stay home more"". The fact that she works less is justified by this messaging in society, and is then ultimately blamed on him, instead of her life decisions.

She then reaps the rewards in the form of less stress, a better work-life balance, more time at home, more time with the kids, guaranteed financial support, a better home life, better health outcomes, better social support from networking, a longer life, and implicit biases in family court.

That's not to say that there aren't mothers out there giving it their best. But the road that turned them into homemakers is paved by feminism, not the actions of men, or the patriarchy.

[At best, feminism has found an ally with traditionalism, which also helps to reinforce this gender dynamic.](https://www.wokefather.com/egalitarianism/the-embrace-of-new-traditionalists-and-feminists-female-privilege/)

Works at Department of Tourism (2018–present)

What was the most gruesome crime you have ever learned of?

Trigger warning

The man in the picture is Dan Shisia Matakhaya, a 31 year-old Kenyan police officer.

￼

He was not born with this frightening appearance. What you see is the result of a normal argument he had with his wife.

One day, Matakhaya and his wife disagreed about a house issue. He considered it as a normal argument and later on that day, he left for work. He had a night shift so he came back home the day after, at 05:30 am.

As he had been working all the night, he went straight to the bed to sleep.

This is the moment his wife chose to come and pour acid solution on his face. Then she ran away. But it was not enough for her to spoil his face, she also acted so that he couldn't escape the bedroom. She had poured water on the floor and connected it to electricity. As soon as Matakhaya stepped on the floor, he felt the electric shock.

As he was screaming, his neighbouring workmates came and found him in his despair. They took him to hospital. His life was saved, but unfortunately not his eyes. Now he is permanently blind.

His wife was firstly arrested, then they released her later on bail. Matakhaya forgave her for what happened but he said he is not going to abandon charge against her. He only met her at the court and all she said was that she doesn't know why she did so.

It is absolutely frightening, absolutely insane, absolutely baffling that women can do basically anything and have a chance of having some white knight cops and lawyers and judges excuse their behavior and just release them on bail. The bail thing is stupid in its own right, but this takes it to a whole new level.",1,0,"['The', 'story', 'of', 'Dan', 'Shisia', 'Matakhaya', 'is', 'sad', 'and', 'extremely', 'frightening']",The story of Dan Shisia Matakhaya is sad and extremely frightening

I'm so frustrated,"This is a post about the results of my argument about Men's Rights and Feminism with my friends. It doesn't contain any new information, study or anything relevant. Read this only if you are curious.

I'm a young male and I'm part of a group of friends, all of the same age. We've been friends for longer than 10 years and always openly talked about many subjects. Recently the topic of feminism was brought up because the girlfriend of one of us (also present in the group) decided to share an instagram post about ""fight for WOMEN in domestic violence"". I knew it wasn't going to be an easy pill to swallow but I decided to comment about it and share my views which go in line with some of the arguments also shared here about the issue.

The group has 10 people, 7 dudes (me included), 3 dudettes. It turned into a conversation about HOW WRONG I AM, about HOW OPPRESSED WOMEN ARE and that I'M BLINDLY OPPOSING WOMEN. In that conversation, half were mostly quiet, but the 3 girls and 2 guys were completely vocal against me. SO I decided to bring some numbers up. They started ranting about the validity of those sources, accusing them of lying (numbers about domestic violence comparing men on women and women on men) or accusing the numbers of not being relevant to the conversation (in case of male suicide rate). They rejected the thought that there's no gender based oppression and quite passionately defended that the society was male dominant and female oppressed.

At some point I concluded, there's no argument possible, they just don't want to listen and/or don't want to know/care. So I just shared thetinmen page, the red pill documentary and left the conversation. Now I'm still collecting my thoughts but I'm so sad. I'm realizing that the world is unfair and there are lots of problems but the blame isn't on the 1%, the blame is on the 99% being fucking sheep and preferring to talk before studying and reflecting. I always had a subconscious idea that the ones who I have enough closure to call friends were integral people with whom I could share my views and have a factual argument where it would be possible to reach a logical consensus based on evidence. I'm wrong and I feel lonely.",47,0,"['I', 'm', 'so', 'frustrated']",I'm so frustrated

Study claiming men are better off after divorce is deceptive,"Some recent posts here and on r/askfeminists have cited [an article in the Guardian](https://web.archive.org/web/20201109021615/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/25/divorce-women-research) that purports to show men are actually better of after separation. With the replies on r/askfeminists heavily censored.

It turns out the article is a masterclass in fake news.

The study cited does not include child support payments. This seems a curious omission, when this was the main complaint given by divorced fathers at the time of the study [see here](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/divorced-fathers-fight-back-over-maintenance-mp-calls-for-review-as-new-child-support-rules-take-their-toll-on-hardpressed-parents-1509072.html).

After divorce men are forced to work more hours to pay the child support, but receive less disposable income because of it. After divorce women may give up any work they have resulting in less income from work - but they still may have a higher disposable income because of the child support.

Counting money women receive and men pay as money men receive, seems highly negligent if not deceitful.

Are modern women and feminists contributing to the rise of men who identify as incel?,"Before anyone blows up at this question, and wants me banned because I identify as incel, I'm simply asking a question and seeking out some honest answers and discussion.

I've spent a fair amount of time in both incel and MGTOW forums over the course of the past few years and there seems to be a common thread amongst both, which is that women today have some very unrealistic high standards and requirements when it comes to dating men, much of this which is be propagated by modern feminism that all women are special and entitled to the very best of high value men they wish to pursue a relationship with, regardless of their own value or what they bring to the table themselves. Therefore there's a whole pool or men which seems to be rapidly growing, who feel they're completely unwanted and unworthy of any type or romantic relationship with women, because the ladies are telling these guys they're just not good enough. This only fuels an already depressed bunch of men into a rage of bitterness and anger, which can sometimes lead to misogyny and hate towards females for being too superficial and vain, which then get stereotyped into a bunch of basement dwelling lazy adult men, which I've found not to be entirely the case with so many of them.

MGTOW's will even acknowledge that there are guys women will right-up reject for not being good looking enough, or that these kind of men are told to wait until they've had their fun in their 20's and early 30's, and will settle down with them when they're no longer desirable to the hot guys they no longer attract, which in way seems to correlate to the same conclusion, only a certain select number of men are even worthy of women's attention in todays dating market.

This points me to Men's Rights Activist Karen Straughan, who said the following...

[***""I know guys who are 35 years old, who are virgins, they have good jobs, they want to have a family, they want to have a wife and kids, and they are just not going to be able to do that, and they know it. Because there is one flaw that would have been overlooked 50 years ago, they would have found some women, some homely, chubby woman who would have been willing to settle down with him, and now that's just not the case.""***](https://youtu.be/SrhgDQjxDaw?t=841) - [Karen Straughan](https://incels.wiki/w/Karen_Straughan)

Having heard this quote many, many times over the past year or so, it really makes me believe she is right in what she's saying, that the requirements women have today when seeking a male partner is ultimately contributing to more and more single and lonely men, many of which then fall into the rabbit hole that is inceldom.

Please discuss, as I really want to have a civil and well thought out discord about this.

The “patriarchy” is little more than the projection of women’s desire for power and they subvert responsibility for this by unjustly placing it on men.,"Hierarchy 

—

In the female dominance hierarchy, women compete indirectly. All women have various ambitions, but keeping those ambitions secret is key to their success.

If you’re unfamiliar with how female dominance hierarchies work - just think about how women talk to one another *when they think no men are around listening* 

Women desire having power, status, control of a “high value male”, and having more “whatever” than the other women in her social circle do. But they do not want to *look* like they are grabbing for power. When women have something that other women do not, they will often plot to find ways to either bring that girl down, or raise the rest of the group up to her level (“hey Jessica, does your new bf have any brothers or friends?”). Notice how jealous girls get when one of her friends gets a boyfriend. It’s not that the girls really care about having a specific guy for her, it’s more that they just want a boyfriend because someone else got a boyfriend. Refer to any of the dating subreddits for stories about this ad naseum...

The female dominance hierarchy is innate in females just as the competitive pecking order hierarchical process is innate in men. For guys, think about the instinctual, subtle cues and body languages that guys communicate to one another when first meeting - often times there is boasting between men to compare accomplishments and victories, to demonstrate status and competence. Much of this is automatic and you don’t even realize you’re doing this until after it’s been said - you probably rationalize by saying that you’re just making friendly conversation by talking about your interests. Women have their own hierarchy but it is nearly imperceptible to most men. It is this way likely because natural selection meant this was the most effective system for the human species to prosper in.

Definitions

- Psychological projection - is a defense mechanism in which the ego defends itself against unconscious impulses or qualities by denying their existence in themselves by attributing them to others

- Cognitive dissonance - the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes, especially as relating to behavioral decisions and attitude change.

- Patriarchy - a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it.

—

Where do morals come from? No not philosophically - where do you first learn about morality? 

For the vast majority of people, it’s from their mom.

Most social etiquette, rules, norms, manners, etc. are communicated from the mother to the child. Most mothers are often repeating the lessons they were taught by their mother, tweaked by her life experience. Over the generations, an evolution of societal rules will culminate. The problem is that these “rules” often get in the way of the dominance hierarchy. 

Sometimes this is good - Jessica gets a new BF? Guess if you murder Jessica, you could assert your dominance in the hierarchy.  Except one problem - someone decided that murder is bad (even though we find justifications for murder all the time throughout history). So, how do you ascend the hierarchy when many of the most effective tactics are against “The Rules” and give you cognitive dissonance?

Subvert the rules by spreading a rumor about Jessica being a slut. Reputation destruction is a bullying tactic that is EXTREMELY common in women - as any woman can tell you if they ever were a teenage girl. This is not something they necessarily grow out of. Look at how politics are done today. Look at twitters cancel culture - which demographic primarily uses that?

If women desire power, and they have to compete with men, but their rules prevent them from overtly chasing power, they must instead subvert the rules by...who can guess it? Reputation destruction.

Instead of competing and grabbing for power and status as a man would - through honest competency and overt competition - many will instead victimize themselves and say that they are “oppressed” and “not allowed”, “don’t have access to”, etc. for whatever it is they desire. 

Think about the wage gap - women STILL claim to believe that it’s about sexism when it’s been clearly shown, innumerable times, that employers cannot pay women less than men - if they could, every single employer would hire only women so that they could pay them less. Women, instead, *CHOOSE* careers that pay less on average than careers that men *CHOOSE* to go into.

Nope! It’s still the patriarchy 

How do women test their man? They make him chase and pursue her. They make him demonstrate his commitment to the idea that she is more special and more unique to him than other women. They mainly desire *his* desire. This also conveniently allows them to dance the line of plausible deniability if they don’t find him attractive enough - they can easily say that the man perused her and she tried to say no, but that damn patriarchy again forcing women to placate men and be subservient to their will!

Conclusion


This system of victimization and blame shifting is the greatest example of Sun Tzu’s the art of war. Subvert subvert subvert. And we men are almost completely unaware of it. 

As time has gone on, the contradictory nature of feminism and women in general is starting to become more apparent. “Patriarchy” is little more than the projection of the female desire for power.

This dovetails nicely into male disposability theory as well. But that’a where I’ll stop for today.",15,0,"['The', 'patriarchy', 'is', 'little', 'more', 'than', 'the', 'projection', 'of', 'women', 's', 'desire', 'for', 'power', 'and', 'they', 'subvert', 'responsibility', 'for', 'this', 'by', 'unjustly', 'placing', 'it', 'on', 'men']",The “patriarchy” is little more than the projection of women’s desire for power and they subvert responsibility for this by unjustly placing it on men.

Brainstorm for a new project on men's rights,"I've been thinking on this idea for a time and I want to put it here on the table to discuss it.

**Motive**

I define feminism today as a politically motivated movement that abuses women, manipulating them, undermining their identity and ultimately rendering them vulnerable so indoctrination to their ideology and other forms of extremism becomes easy.

The vast majority of feminists, alienated by that very manipulation, become resented and hostile towards men, some of which also leaks down to non extremists but people that identify as feminists purely due to their definition which is virtuous.

The power for censoring of feminist lobbyist is deproportionate against our attempts to inform people, way too many new people adhere to ideology and the huge majority adhering to feminism are extremely resistant to different views. It's simply a losing battle.

Today I am deeply worried of having to put up with this for the rest of my life, and I honestly simply want out but I don't have the resources to be well informed about how to migrate to a more sane society where one can actually be a man and not be demeaned all day long every time I turn on the TV.

**The idea**

The idea I come to throw here it's to make an online map that properly analyzes and weigh what countries are still a place for men to actually live freely and not fearing false accusations, discrimination by law or general hostility in a day to day basis.

This map could be colored to demonstrate how hostile each country is to men, and all this information can be retrieved and analyzed to affect their score.

A list of ideas of aspects to document and to make up the scores of:

* Since when this country is Influenced by feminism.
* Is there a ministry for women issues?
   * Is it also the one supposed to dictate norms on gender equality?
* Successful lobbying against men
   * Laws
   * How they have influenced the media
   * How many feminists are in the media business
   * Interventions meant to manipulate gender views
   * Interventions with the intent of indoctrinating against men

What are your opinions on modern dating and whether it's worth the risk for a male in 2021,"To start, I'm 18 and come from quite a Catholic religious background, and although I still hold some principles from that time and some of the morals are ingrained in me, I'm not necessarily overly Conservative when it comes to relationships, so this question is directed to anyone of whatever orientation /religion, and I'd like it to be noted these are just my beliefs and opinions.

Over the last few years I've been quite hesitant about entering a relationship with anyone, I find it quite hard to trust a partner and overall feel that I am quite jealous, more so keeping jealous thoughts private but my actions can reflect how I'm feeling so I suppose it still needs work. In this way, I am very traditional in the belief that when you're with someone, you are tied to each other and have loyalty to one another. So these open relationship ideas I personally just see as an excuse to cheat and not feel bad about it. Then I also see an influx in young girls starting onlyfans accounts and degrading themselves online, which again I don't think personally I could be with some who shows themselves freely or for profit to others online without first being in a dedicated relationship with them.

I believe these are logical stances to hold but I'd like to hear from others as well.

Now when it comes to the following, I don't like that I think these things but admittedly it is going through my head so here's my more illogical issues:
I'm not comfortable with the idea of thinking about a partners previous sexual history. I dread the day that I'm with a girl for example, meet another dude and they can say ""ha I did x or y, with your gf"". This would be childish and immature yes but there are undoubtedly people like this in the world so I'm not sure how I'd approach a situation like that, which brings in the idea of ""leaving sex till marriage"" which I'm not completely against but THEN you come across the issue of should modern men even be considering marriage due to the unfairness of divorce settlements and the average outcome of relationships at the moment.

I see a lot of men (and women tbf but I'm speaking from my perspective) having a lot of trust issues when it comes to choosing a partner nowadays and it seems like society is just focused on quick hook ups and casual sex based on pure lust and nothing else.

But I've experienced relationships that have meant a lot to me and it seems an awful shame to sacrifice the notion of a future with someone you could potentially care a lot about merely due to the possible negative outcomes.

That's my thoughts, I apologise if they are sort of scattered I needed to rant. I would truly appreciate any anecdotes or opinions from others as to their opinions or positions on effective dating in 2021",32,0,"['What', 'are', 'your', 'opinions', 'on', 'modern', 'dating', 'and', 'whether', 'it', 's', 'worth', 'the', 'risk', 'for', 'a', 'male', 'in', '2021']",What are your opinions on modern dating and whether it's worth the risk for a male in 2021

Also Obamas insane policies in education seriously harming boys, almost by design:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0wCBFNTVhk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0wCBFNTVhk)

As ive posted before, teachers mark girls higher for IDENTICAL work, to the point where just changing to a.girls name gets a boy 1/3 grade higher mark. as well as punishing boys differently. See below for all the studies. What do you expect when feminsim teaches extreme misnadry, male privelge theory etc.... that feminise teachers will be like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Previous submission got deleted by mod eventually so reposting here... still check it out as many excellent comments from men and women about their experience of this bias... many pointed out very obvious misandric comments from their teachers, some teachers even commented about their biases:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers\_mark\_girls\_higher\_for\_identical\_work\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/)

This is an unpopular fact as it widely held in society that women and girls are discriminated against in education and in work, indeed in everything in life.

Note; below is general statement, countless awesome teachers but....

**Education is an example of institutional sexism. Now this data should to even feminist not be surprising... after all they call male majority and even female majority places as rife with sexism and ""male norms"" i.e. women have to act like men... is it any surprise then in teaching where 98% of early educators are female, 90% primary school teachers are female and these teachers have often studied gender studies type radical subjects at uni, and all HR and admin is female, that there is ""female norms"" being applied in education..... that the default child is a girl according to teachers? As the following data shows e.g. female teachers punishing boys for entirely normal behaviour that they dont understand; marking girls higher for IDENTICAL work, and giving higher predicted grades (despite boys objectively getting higher real life assesments) as they prefer girl students as model students and can relate to girl students better.... it is no wonder that schools are reducing play times, even removing physical education completely and replacing it with in class movement.... i.e. an entirely anti boy environment.... if 40% of boys are being drugged with aderal in some schools, do you think 40% of boys are unwell or maybe its the teachers who are shit and the system they made?**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Over then entire OECD countries globally, a large scale study showed that girls were given higher marks for IDENTICAL work to boys. OECD also showed that a boy receives 1/3 higher grade if the teacher does not know he is a boy. Interestingly this gender gap goes away when it is a male teacher doing the marking.

Cornwell found that boys in all racial categories are not being *“commensurately graded by their teachers”* in any subject *“as their test scores would predict.”*

The answer lies in the way teachers, who are statistically mostly women, evaluate students without reference to objective test scores. Boys are regularly graded well below their actual academic performance.

Boys are falling significantly behind in grades, *“despite performing as least as well as girls on math tests, and significantly better on science tests.”*

After fifth grade, he found, student assessment becomes a matter of *“a teacher’s subjective assessment of the student’s performance”*, and is further removed from the guidance of objective test results. Teachers, he says, tend to assess students on non-cognitive, *“socio-emotional skills.”*This has had a significant impact on boys’ later achievement because, while objective test scores are important, it is teacher-assigned grades that determine a child’s future with class placement, high school graduation and college admissibility.

Eliminating the factor of *“non-cognitive skills…almost eliminates the estimated gender gap in reading grades”*, Cornwell found. He said he found it *“surprising”* that although boys out-perform girls on math and science test scores, girls out-perform boys on teacher-assigned grades.

The report also found that:

* At primary level 85% of teachers are female. This has remained roughly the same since 2003.
* At secondary level the percentage of male teachers has fallen steadily at first and later precipitously from 40% in 2003 to 31.7% in 2012.

**It has been shown that boys and girls do better in reading when they have a same sex teacher. Just one year with a male teacher reduced the reading gap by 1/3 for 13 year old boys. It has als been shown:**

In another study in the work place researchers asked supervisors to grade two poorly written essays and to provide feedback directly to each writer over chat, so that the writer could improve. At this point, the writers' names (Andrew or Sarah) were revealed, revealing that one was a man, the other a woman. Participants submitted a grade to each writer, as well as substantive comments to improve their essays.

Participants were more likely to tell white lies to the woman writer,  **inflating Sarah's grades nearly a full letter grade higher than from their initial private evaluation. They also gave her more positive comments than they gave Andrew. In contrast, the man's in-person feedback was statistically indistinguishable from the participants' undisclosed evaluations of his work.**

**Please note:** When this study was reported, it was reported as being discrimination towards women as their performance was being upgraded and they weret being given correct feedback, rather than the more obvious statement, that men are being disrimnated against and women work is being marked up.

Boys 'being held back by women teachers' as gender stereotypes are reinforced in the classroom

[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1307856/Boys-held-women-teachers-gender-stereotypes-reinforced-classroom.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1307856/Boys-held-women-teachers-gender-stereotypes-reinforced-classroom.html)

Christian Hoff Sommers explains how boys are being punished for normal behaviours:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFpYj0E-yb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFpYj0E-yb4)

Do Schools discrimiante against boys: Dr. Jim Dueck, author, former Assistant Deputy Minister of Education for the province of Alberta, and former head of Accountability and Student Assessment, performed a revealing analysis on current practices in student assessment. The results were not only remarkable but very disturbing, exposing what might well be an institutional suppression of the performance of male students.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ)

Related, despite a widely held view to the contrary, in a large scale national study, women are favoured 2:1 over IDENTICAL or even slightly more qualified men in STEM applicationss but gender BLIND helps men significantly, and the latter is now becoming less commonly applied as a result.

[https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360)

This could go to explain why many prominent claims of discrimination have failed as there is a perceived bias but on investigation, this is proved false e.g. US womens football team equal pay claim led to the judge saying the women were paid more than men, or women suing Google only for Googles results to show they were paying mens less.

Funding:

Females given $6 billion per year more in grants by government for education despite being the overwhelming majoirty in university

There are also 11 female only scholarships per 1 male one, with some universities have 100 female only scholarships and none for men, again despite men being a minority in university, and in alsmost all courses (even in STEM technically men are a minority, its only a few specfic subjects e.g. physics, computer science that men are a majority while women are a majority in Medicine, Biology, Nursing, Psychology, Veteniary Medicine etc)

**At home (similar ins school):**

Boys are more likely to receive corporal punishment from their parents then girls ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952896/)). They are also, in general, more likely to recieve severe verbal and physical punishment from both mothers and fathers ([source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227312033_Harsh_Discipline_and_Child_Problem_Behaviors_The_Roles_of_Positive_Parenting_and_Gender/link/55aeac6b08aed9b7dcdda4c0/download)). Some studies indicate the difference is less pronounced at the home and may be non-significant in the first years of infancy ([source](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/113/Supplement_5/1952.full.pdf)), but the difference is still present in the same direction as it is in schools for most of adolescence.

**Can something be done? Of course:**

[http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept06/vol64/num01/Teaching-to-the-Minds-of-Boys.aspx](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept06/vol64/num01/Teaching-to-the-Minds-of-Boys.aspx)

This school took a boy friendly approach. What was applied is explaied in detail. **Boys performance rocketed, gender gap went and girls performance went up nearly as much too.**Current system is bad for everyone but it just s happens it massively favours girls. I think it will get worse bad sterotypes about boys and now literally every other story about manspreading, mansplaining, toxic masculinty, menaretrash (real hashtag on twitter) all will not help. There is no political will... in the UK the head of uni admissions even said she thinks its a scandal no one is doing anything about plumetting uni levels for boys and if any other group it would be an outrage.... Uni of Arizona has 160 female only scholarships and 2 male ones despite women outnumbering men in almost every single degree... in the very few that they dont in STEM (not even all stem, for example more female medics, biology, vets) they are actively recruiting girls but doing nothing for boys

Telegraph article on number of men in teaching, and techers openly admitting to sexism in favour of girls:

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html)

I do know from my own direct experience that many young women of the 1960s and 1970s went into teaching inspired by a feminist mission to raise the self-esteem and the social position of girls. I could name at least half a dozen women teachers I knew personally in the later decades of the last century who were proud to say that they favoured girls in class to make up for the oppression of women in the past. The moral dubiety – and outright sexist prejudice - of inflicting second-class treatment on little boys who could bear no personal responsibility for those alleged (and profoundly questionable) historical crimes never seemed to trouble those apostles of equality. Men are hardly likely to become primary school teachers because they feel they owe a duty to their sex

By the same token, I can name a similar number of feminist commentators in the media/political establishment who celebrated the rise of educational attainments for girls in school as evidence that females are, by birth and nature, superior to males. As girls overtook boys in grades and exam results at all levels throughout the education system, those sisters were cock-a-hoop at their gender’s triumph – never acknowledging that the advantage of one sex must have been bought at the expense of the other. Not one Secretary of State for Education in the last 40 years has expressed concern that the [gender divide in academic achievement ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/11364130/Girls-do-better-than-boys-at-school-despite-inequality.html)reflected a worrying ethos in schools that imposed disadvantage and inequality on boys. They wouldn’t dare.

Along with the politicians, men, as a whole, simply gave in to this feminist-driven growth of inequality with the bovine supinity which has characterised their outlook for the last half century.

So a guy my age was legit flirting with me for days and I mistook it for something else,"It was sometimes in November. I was waiting for the bus and asked him when the next bus would arrive. We started talking mainly about Tv shows and then about, music, military serivice, mental health, nutrition, normal stuff. He said I should watch Rick and Morty. We sat next to each other on the bus and I thought I had finally made a decent friend and even asked for his insta (j think that's when he got the wrong idea).At one point I told him he felt like an actual brother since my actual brother has schizophrenia.(before I knew what was going on). I the following days, his uncle died and i was genuinely saying how sorry I was.(again, I think this had a different unintentional effect in him). After noticing that I wasn't having it, He asked in a very vague, indirect way ""i may be wrong but.."" - I don't remember the exact words, but he basically tried to gaslight me into thinking that I was flirting with him, and that's when I laughed in disgust almost, (I have no problem with gay people at all, but I myself am straight) and jokingly asked if he had a crush on me, he said no. I thought it was just a misunderstanding. The next day I wrote him essay how I was sorry if I had given him the wrong impression, and that I was raised to be nice to everyone. I gave him some time after the funneral before invinting him for beers. He politely declined and then he ghosted me completely. It took me weeks before I realized what had actually happened so sadly, none of us got what we wanted. I just thought I'd tell this story here.

I want to discuss a bit,"First please don’t downvote this post to hell, I have very different opinions than people on this subreddit, I want to discuss.

I’ve seen a lot of ""antifeminisme"" on this subreddit and I have to disagree, feminism is a good thing, some posts say that it’s a ""hate stuff thing"" there are a lot of feminist rally in my town and, even though I haven’t participated in them I have talked to a lot of people and some of my classmates are very activists, they where always very open to discussion and very kind.

The second point I see a lot is female rape is as big as male rape, now rape is a serious crime that can ruine a person’s life (that’s why we should take rape allegations seriously and not make fun of it, that’s why a lot of rape victims male or female are afraid of saying it) but in the US there are 7.7610058 times more female rape than women.

Than about women’s abusing men or straight out murdering them, same, according to this source: https://www.thehotline.org/stakeholders/domestic-violence-statistics/
women experience about 1/4 women are abused and 1/7 men are, that’s a pretty big difference.

My point isn’t that, what this subreddit seems to think feminism is, that we should put men and women to the same stage, like if you want to make bill gates and some random dude equal, we shouldn’t give 10’000 bucks to both

You should talk more to people who have a different opinion. Oh and btw have you ever bed insulted, someone ever said something sexist to you or almost sexually assaulted you in the street because of your sexe ? I haven’t, all my friends haven’t but girls have to deal with this a lot.

Toxic Masculinity Doesn't Exist - An Essay,"Toxic Masculinity doesn't exist.  Don't even acknowledge the term.  It's specifically used as a dog-whistle to automatically associate negative traits with masculinity.  Sort of like ""deplorables"" was used by Hillary to disenfranchise poor white voters, how the term ""thugs"" is currently used as a placeholder for the ""n-word"" by racist idiots,  and the sarcastic use of ""religion of peace"" is used by racist losers to refer to Muslims in the media,  the terms aren't meant to explain or highlight any sort of behavior as much as they are used to associate negative traits with certain groups and encourage irrational hate against them.  It's a trigger word used to do what females do best: **causing divisions by way of Relational Aggression.**

These terms are a form of relational aggression.  They're trying to encourage a culture where open discrimination against men in public places like work and school will be acceptable.  If it becomes publicly acceptable, it's going to become a word used to do nothing other than shame men.    


It should be as offensive to you to have that term ***even be used in public***, just like it is to refer to blacks as ""thugs,"" poor whites as ""deplorables,"" or sarcastically use the phrase ""religion of peace"" when referring to Muslims or Middle Easterners.  Imagine actually using those terms RIGHT NOW in your workplace, school, or other public places.  You would get CRUCIFIED because they absolutely are horrible terms to use and their connotations are KNOWN.  Everyone knows they are placeholders for more hateful words use by trashy low-lifes at the fringes of society.  


Feminists look at *""strong""* female role models and refer to them as ""positive, encouraging, empowering""  but men who have those exact same traits, if they're even allowed to exist in mainstream media anymore, are referred to exhibiting ""toxic masculinity"" ONLY because they're men and for no other reason.  Don't let misandry be publicly acceptable behavior online or in real life.   


Don't answer to or acknowledge the term Toxic Masculinity - it's a losing proposition.  You're getting bullied into working against yourselves by acknowledging it exists.  By answering to it, you're opening the door that allows those conversations to happen and for the environment I explained above to flourish.  Toxic masculinity doesn't exist and anyone that does use it should be looked down on and shut-out.",7,0,"['Toxic', 'Masculinity', 'Doesn', 't', 'Exist', 'An', 'Essay']",Toxic Masculinity Doesn't Exist - An Essay

Military / Child support and custody battle,"Hey I am joining the Army this month, and will be going in while fighting a bit of a legal battle. This last week my kids mom decided she was not going to let my daughter (8) go to my wedding. She's using covid as an excuse, however Ive spent nearly every weekend with her since this covid thing started. She was served papers and now is being spiteful. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone had any experience in child support norms in the military? I will be an 0-1 after all my training, and can't seem to find much on how it's calculated. I assume it can be set in my originating zone of Missouri, as that is where I filed for joint custody and everything. I've been paying $500 a month as an agreed upon amount, however she just got a corporates job and will likely be making more money than I will be in the military. 

Any advice will help, thank you.",5,0,"['Military', 'Child', 'support', 'and', 'custody', 'battle']",Military / Child support and custody battle

Experiment (MRA side),"OK, so I'm conducting an experiment with this subreddit and r/Ask Feminists. I already know some cases of discrimination against men, such as with false rape allegations, family court, reproductive rights and non-reciprocal cases of domestic abuse and intimate terrorism. Can you give some more examples of cases where men are clearly discriminated against or at a disadvantage where there aren't any uncontrollable variables are at play? And as an aside, do you think gender and race quotas are doing more harm or good? 

For the aside, I don't agree with the gender and race quotas. While they do get POCs jobs, they will never know whether it was on their own merit or if the company decided that they had 'too many white people' or 'too many men'.
 That could cause them to second guess themselves, which could lead to mental health issues down the line, especially anxiety. Also, it means that there might have been a white man who worked his ass off for his degree and prepped himself for the interview, who was relying on the company to hire him since he was qualified for a job they wanted. And he was dismissed because of his skin colour. And if he doesn't know about the diversity quotas, then he would assume that he wasn't the best candidate, so he may delve into unhealthy habits and develop mental health issues of his own, most likely depression.

 So what's the outcome? The POC works at a job they feel like they didn't earn, the white man is unemployed, and both develop mental problems.

"Why are all old people so damn toxic to young men, and why do you think America is failing?","I've noticed that especially aimed towards men, old people are just absolutely cancerous. After having lived with my aunt to help keep her at home for a year, I figured out fast how disgusting old people can be. Ignorant, stupid, childish, rude, demanding, and then add in some hatred of young people and you get an old person. I think they're far outliving their normal age limit thanks to the medical advances fucking all younger people over. We get our inheritance later, we have trouble having children and caring for them, because our parents expect us to drop everything and help care for them 10-15 years, and we get oppressed by an older population that won't let us change the country in the ways we want to. Honestly, that last part is the worst of it. Too many old people hold down the best jobs, and are still in positions of power. Their thinking is incredibly archaic, and doesn't line up with 90% of younger men and women in America. Why is there even a minimum age limit imposed on our presidents? I don't want Joe Biden at his age to be president. He's ancient and his policies are going to favor what old people want, and not the young people that have to deal with them.

This is just my personal experience with older people, and I'm sure many of you haven't dropped everything to try and help someone you thought you knew and cared about. It can be really really terrible. I gained weight, I lost income to help care for her, I had next to no free-time, and I was constantly insulted for being a young man, which I heavily resented her for and still do. Do any others think that old people are really just destroying the country for the younger generation? If not, what else can you blame for the way the country has been heading? Birth rates are down, feminism is up, hatred of men is up, and we're finally seeing people leaving America in droves.

Also, has anyone wondered where exactly our taxes are fucking going? One of the highest taxes in the world and yet we still have nothing to show for it. Where's our cheap healthcare? Where's our fast public transportation like bullet trains? If I lived in Europe, I could visit many different cities by train and add some variety to my life. In America, I have to drive on crowded freeways for hours and deal with the constant threat of a wreck. America seems far behind the times thanks to companies wanting to milk car, gas, and oil sales for as long as possible. I do think America needs to purge that shit and focus on actually improving social growth by improving public transportation and healthcare. Rework the fucking healthcare, for God's sake. It's terrible! I don't even care if every single car company leaves America because of public transportation, because where are they going to go? Not many other countries still need cars, so good luck to those money-grubbing bastards.",14,0,"['Why', 'are', 'all', 'old', 'people', 'so', 'damn', 'toxic', 'to', 'young', 'men', 'and', 'why', 'do', 'you', 'think', 'America', 'is', 'failing']","Why are all old people so damn toxic to young men, and why do you think America is failing?"

He’s helped raise her daughter since she was 2.
She pushed (forced) them into a Poly relationship after their 1st year of marriage. 
(Can’t really call it poly if the husband doesn’t consent, huh?)
He went to care for his Dad with Dementia in Florida after a year in that situation but they kept in touch.
Then Covid hit and in March &amp; her Polyboy left to shelter with Family. 
She asked him to come up (to Connecticut) to be with her and her daughter. So he packed up the Florida apartment, flew his Dad up into a New Townhome, moved their stuff from the old apartment into the new home.
That was March. July she goes looking for a new guy and found “the one” in September. She’s been dating the new guy since. 

He’s had enough and he’s divorcing her in February. The daughter, now 14, “seems” to be taking everything in stride but tells him she’ll miss him so much after he moves.

I’ll show him this post after a week of comments. The reason: I want him to know it wasn’t just coming from me. That’s why I stated this as informatively as possible. 
I even almost left out the part where he’s a combat vet with ptsd taking care of his Viet Nam-era vet father with dementia.

What do you think are the most positive forms of masculinity?,"It's true that some socially constructed ideas of masculinity (perpetuated by both men and women) end up hurting men. However masculinity isn't inherently bad, and rather than focussing on the negatives we should celebrate the positives. 

So what do you think is the most positive masculine trait?

Personally, I like self-confidence. To me the ""manliest"" men are those who aren't afraid of what society thinks of them or what they will be labelled. Who aren't afraid of being called gay, or dressing weird, and acting like a clown. To me there's nothing more manly than not giving a shit what people think about you. And I think that's a positive thing, and everyone in society should be more confident in themselves.",18,0,"['What', 'do', 'you', 'think', 'are', 'the', 'most', 'positive', 'forms', 'of', 'masculinity']",What do you think are the most positive forms of masculinity?

How do I support men’s rights without sounding like an MRA,"On mobile, pardon funky stuff
I’ve always thought of myself as a egalitarian, and when I was younger that believe mostly pertained towards women, though in recent years I’ve begun to notice the men’s issues and care more deeply about them, as I see them as a bigger threat at the moment. Recently I’ve been watching a bunch of Sydney Watson, shes charismatic, and when it comes to men’s rights, she’s not overly red-pilled, though some of her content is. For a while I have been trying to defend both sides of the spectrum, but as a white male, I am finding increasing struggles defending men and coming off as an ‘MRA’

Of course, I should specify why I don’t want to sound like an MRA. I’m sure many of us understand the difference between a lot of people who support men’s rights, and MRA’s, where MRA’s can be a lot more violent and toxic, or follow in third wave feminism’s footsteps and practice equality through putting down women, and not picking men up.

I want to support my fellow men in a constructive, helpful way that when talking to misandrists, actually ring a bell, so that they can’t just dismiss me as a sexist/misogynist. So if anyone has learned to walk this fine line, of supporting men in a way the opposite side doesn’t see as opposition, but instead a means to the same end goal-equality",33,0,"['How', 'do', 'I', 'support', 'men', 's', 'rights', 'without', 'sounding', 'like', 'an', 'MRA']",How do I support men’s rights without sounding like an MRA

Good movies/shows for young boys?,"Hi everyone,

Been fighting to see my son for 3 1/2 years now after his mom abducted him to her home country. 

Since I applied for the return of our son to his country of residence under the Hague convention, she has waged a brutal war of attrition, using all the classic tools of the trade against me including false criminal accusations and parental alienation. 

What irks me most is that she is feminizing him by having him wear tiaras in public, wearing dresses, and buying him girls' toys like dolls and princess castles. 

He is a real boy though, and whenever he has the choice will always choose classic boy toys like cars, toy guns, Pokemons etc.... 

Lately he's been asking me to buy him girl tv-show related toys that I'm sure his mom is making him watch. 

I'll hopefully be seeing him soon and would like to introduce him to some male-positive tv shows/movies/cartoon series that I'm sure he'd prefer over his mom's choices for him. 

I was hoping for some advice from you guys regarding what I should look into for a boy his age (he's almost 7 now) that would show him that being a boy is ok and to role models that he can ""look up to"" when I'm not around. 

Any thoughts?",44,0,"['Good', 'movies', 'shows', 'for', 'young', 'boys']",Good movies/shows for young boys?

If i don't want to be friends with women, because i don't want drama or feelings that are bound to happen, i get labled as sexist and misogynistic.

I get it, women had a tough time in the past, but you can't just hurt me, belittle me or dismiss me. I want equality for all but going after men is not the answer, lift women up not bring men down.

It's getting near the birthday of the girl who destroyed my life and drove me to attempted suicide.

I need help:(,"Me M 20.  Her F 23
My ex and I got into it nearly 2 years ago. She beat me up pretty good left a gash across my chest, bite marks and bruises, she had like 2 bruises from me trying to get her off of me. We both have pictures of the abuse. My mom tried reporting her to my ""mandated reporter"" social worker WHEN IT HAPPENED who did nothing about it. She also has video of another time when she was beating me up and I also tried to push her off of me and pin her and I was screaming at her, but obviously the video is cut to only where I start dominating the fight. The videos delete after so long, so she must've recorded on her phone from where I start getting her off of me. So the police cannot get the original video most likely unless they talk to the company who does the security footage as the original deleted. 

She reported me for Domestic Violence, Aggravated Assault, DV in the presence of a child, and criminal mischief all felonies, 2-3 weeks ago, and I got arrested and spent Christmas and a little over a week after that in jail before I was able to finally bail out. This all took place about 1.5-2 years ago. Her and I have been broken up for the last 6 months bc she cheated on me. She also filed a protective order, and SIGNED MY DAUGHTERS NAME ON IT😡 idc about her anymore but don't infringe on my relationship with my daughter. 

Couple questions with my new charges
1. Why didn't she report it 2 years ago?    2. Why didn't she report me 6 months ago when we broke up, why wait tell a couple days before Christmas??    3. Would the Aggravated Assault fall off seeing as I didnt have a weapon, and I genuinely believe I was acting in self defense (though the way she cut the videos doesn't make it seem like that)    4. She put she was scared that I would come to her house after being served the protective order which just kept me in jail for longer, how is she scared if she waited almost 2 years to report it?    5. HOW DO I BEST PROCEED WITH HAVING SPENT ALL MY MONEY ON BAIL AND NO LONGER BEING ABLE TO AFFORD A LAWYER? public defender is the best i can do. Is that going to be sufficient to prove my innocence? Especially seeing as the court system favors girls. 

(You know if she reported ME to my social worker instead of my mom on HER 2 years ago that they wouldve taken action) 

Also I was never read my rights when I was arrested.


But I was kinda being dumb at the start and not shutting up bc they were saying they had video and I didnt deny anything which probably doesn't look the best on me, I just took the ride😔 

Also my mom remembers when I was walking into my moms garage and my ex punched me, then when I walked inside I was carrying my daughter inside, and the ex punched me in the dick and my mom told her to knock it off.    6. Will having my mom as probably the only person who's actually seen it help me enough to get out of this mess??",28,0,"['I', 'need', 'help']",I need help:(

 I am in US on work visa and basically from india...

I had supported my wife to help her get masters in engineering after marriage... I had supported her father financially and medically whenever he used to hospitalized... I helped her brother to get job... I have a son from her...

She basically was angry on me that I am not leaving US and coming back to india to live with her parents... 

I my self is a victim of domestic violence... my wife used to hit me with baseball bat, punched me on chest and slapped me many times and used to give me blood scratches by her nails over my body .... 


Long story shot... she wants me to be her slave and when I finally decided to denied that ... she filed all kind of cases on me, parents, sister and her husband ( which is what you get in india... your whole family gets accused into false cases even though they have nothing to do with anyone of you).....

I am fighting my cases in india since 4 years during which I am also not able to speak or see my son due to court orders and many other issues...

I finally left any hope that I could ever talk to him... In india women gets maintenance for life and child support for very long time... I have been awarded maintenance order (to her and my son from date of filing so I have to pay her since 4 years cumulative money) ... that I have started paying right now... 


I am lonely, depressed due to that I had developed diabetes and many other medical lifestyle issues... I am trying to improve my self... I hope i will one day...


I am thinking this question since 4 years ... I did everything that society, law , people told me to do... 

I loved her.. respect and supported her and her family... give to her and her family in needs... respect all women in my life and office and female colleagues... I never cheated or involved with anyone else than my wife... I never went to prostitutes... 

I basically been a best man I can to her... but still for society and people I am a bad guy and looser father...


I wanted to kill my self but somehow come out of that thought... today I have seen a video where a so called rapist got mob justice where people penetrating stick in his ass and dogs eat his groins (penis and balls) alive.... where em he was shouting in pain and people force the clothes in his mouth.... now no body is sure whether he was proven rapist... I felt so much worse about it... I know a case where mob killed an innocent man and hanged him naked... later confessed by girl that she got afraid of her affair with another man and in hurry she lied about this man....but that guy got killed by mob...

I am really afraid of this world... where women’s words are reality and men’s innocence is a joke..

Feminists Censoring Logical Fallacies That Hurt Them,"Wikipedia and other pages have been manipulated into removing articles on logical fallacies that harm the feminist narrative.

The most evident one I've been able to find is the article on Apex Fallacy.  It is when people look at the highest positions of power (politics, CEOs, celebrity, etc) and see those positions are held by men. Then they falsely assume all men have that level of power when completely ignoring that it takes a lot of power and generational wealth to get those men into those places..

Why is it ignored? Because it weakens their argument to acknowledge women who were born into the same privlidge always had the same doors opened to them.  This helps secure funding for sexist scholarships, grants, and other government funded programs that ignore young men who never had those opportunities to begin with. It helps out underqualified women in positions of power and privilege they haven't earned. 

Having the highest rates of suicide, mental illness, stress related diseases, death from violence, etc is not privlidge.  It's a symptom of exactly the opposite.",14,0,"['Feminists', 'Censoring', 'Logical', 'Fallacies', 'That', 'Hurt', 'Them']",Feminists Censoring Logical Fallacies That Hurt Them

No na you can't boys so think 100 times to say that girls are weaker than boys""**

**""Being a boy I personally think that- women are really stronger than men also in outwards and inwards😶I have got this idea from my mom 😐""**

**""When people say that girls or women are a burden, ask them who gave birth to them, ask them who makes their food, ask them who knows what they do. And ask them who supports you till the end  and loves them till the end.""**

**""We girls and women has that ⚡ power  That anyone do not have 😠""**

**""Who says girls are weaker if they want they can do anything""**

**""In real life,girls are stronger actually according to the psychologist  But due to mental pressure and always listening that boys are stronger and they can do anything so that's why girls become weak.  Don't listen others just keep going by yourself""**

&amp;#x200B;

It always seem like when there's something about female empowerment, there always has to be women who act patronizing to men because of it. No gender is better than the other. 

Yes, women can be strong and there's many women who are stronger than men are. But then our society needs to stop teaching men to put their lives at risk for only women and expect hem to risk their lives for women in order to support that fact. If women can protect themselves, then why do they need protection from men?

Women can't just act superior to men, and then expect them to help them when they need their help. You can't have your cake and eat it. 

That is what is annoying about our society. They try teaching men to protect women, while at the same time teaching women that they are strong and don't need men. They need to stick to one thing. 

As for the whole ""women can get pregnant and handle childbirth while men can't thing"" that's a stupid comparison. For one, men can't get pregnant, and two, every women handles giving birth differently, some handle it very well while others don't. Also, men are the reason why women get pregnant in the first place. If it wasn't for men, women couldn't get pregnant.",11,0,"['It', 'seems', 'like', 'less', 'men', 'want', 'to', 'protect', 'women', 'in', 'this', 'world', 'now']",It seems like less men want to protect women in this world now

"Study: Women leaders did NOT do better at handling COVID and the reason it was claimed was due to sexism: hyper-focusing on good women, ignoring bad women, hyper focusing on bad men, ignoring good men (the study is generous, women leaders actually did significantly worse)","[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9102585/COVID-19-Countries-led-women-NOT-fared-significantly-better-pandemic.html?login#newcomment](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9102585/COVID-19-Countries-led-women-NOT-fared-significantly-better-pandemic.html?login#newcomment)

The reason this was sexist nonsense is because the original claim (women leaders better handled pandemic which was falsely claimed by a study then cited bu UN, WEF, Times, Guardian, BBC, etc) was:

1) Entirely false to being with

2) Due to Gamma Bias

# 1) entirely false to being with 

See here, not only did female leaders, but even higher female majority parliaments did worse:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/idz5ih/self\_according\_to\_european\_cdc\_and\_oxford/](https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/idz5ih/self_according_to_european_cdc_and_oxford/)

To be clear, to me with a brain THAT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN... there are countless factors, but it makes it even more hilarious those agenda drive fake researchers tried to say women did better, when they literally did worse.

The study saying otherwise was absurd in its logical gymnastics to try and paint a false picture: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ie5zng/fundamental\_analysis\_flaws\_underlying\_just\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ie5zng/fundamental_analysis_flaws_underlying_just_about/)

# 2) The reason: due to Gamma bias: 

[https://malepsychology.org.uk/2018/12/04/why-are-there-so-many-disagreements-about-gender-issues-its-usually-down-to-gamma-bias/](https://malepsychology.org.uk/2018/12/04/why-are-there-so-many-disagreements-about-gender-issues-its-usually-down-to-gamma-bias/)

Within the “celebration” cell, for example, the positive achievements of women are routinely celebrated as a gender issue. Within the same cell in the table, the positive actions and achievements of men are not similarly celebrated or gendered. For example, when a group of boys was recently rescued from dangerous underwater caves in Thailand, it was not reported as a gender issue or as a positive example of masculinity, despite the fact that all the rescuers were male.

In the “victimhood” cell, domestic violence against women, for example, is highlighted as a gender issue, whereas domestic violence against men is played down or completely ignored, despite the [substantial numbers of male victims](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-013-9194-1). When men make up the majority of victims (e.g. suicide, rough sleeping, deaths at work, addiction), the issues are not highlighted or portrayed as gender issues.

Within the “privilege” cell, male privileges are magnified in our media and politics as “patriarchy” whereas female privileges (for example relating to children and family life) are played down or ignored as gender issues.

The overall impact of gamma bias therefore, according to this hypothesis, is that masculinity is made to look significantly worse than it really is whilst simultaneously femininity is made to look significantly better than it really is.

[Sexual Aggression Victimization and Perpetration Among Female and Male University Students in Poland](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0886260515609583)

This is a 2015 study which examined the prevalence of victimisation and perpetration of sexual aggression since age 15 in a convenience sample of 565 Polish university students (356 females). While there was a larger gap in self-reported perpetration of sexual aggression, self-reported victimisation did not differ significantly by sex - the overall self-reported victimisation rate was 34.3% for females and 28.4% for males.

Broken down by coercive strategy, the highest victimisation rates were found for the use or threat of physical force (women: 23.1% and men: 20.5%), followed by the exploitation of their incapacitated state (17.6% and 11.7%). The victimisation rate was lowest for the use of verbal pressure (11.6% and 5.4%). Note that the victimisation rates for men and women when it comes to the forms of sexual aggression which involve force (experiencing unwanted sexual contact through use or threat of physical force and exploitation of incapacitated state) are virtually equal.

Their results regarding victimisation are broken down further in Table 2 by victim-perpetrator relationship and type of unwanted sexual contact. When one looks at gender differences at the item level, some interesting details reveal themselves.

A higher proportion of men than women reported unwanted sex from an (ex-)partner (10.8% and 6.8% respectively), a friend/acquaintance (9.8% and 4.3% respectively), and a stranger (6.9% and 1.4% respectively) through the threat or use of physical force. An equivalent or greater proportion of men than women also reported unwanted sex from an (ex-)partner (4.9% and 3.7% respectively), a friend/acquaintance (6.8% and 3.1% respectively) and a stranger (2.4% and 1.4% respectively) through the exploitation of their incapacitated state.

""With regard to the coercive strategies used by the perpetrator, the threat or use of physical force was the most commonly reported strategy, indicated by 73.8% of women and 62.1% of men, followed by the exploitation of the victim’s inability to resist, with 40.5% and 31.9%, respectively, and the use of verbal pressure, with 26.9% and 21.4%.""

[Violence and Sexual Coercion in High School Students' Dating Relationships](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007545302987)

The present study sought to investigate the extent of dating violence victimisation in a New Zealand sample of senior high school students and the perceived reasons for the violence, emotional effects, disclosure of the violence, and relationship consequences. Participants were 200 female and 173 male senior high school students aged 16 to 20 years (mean 16.7) who volunteered to take part in the study.

Students were asked about unwanted kissing, hugging, French kissing, genital contact (‘‘being felt up’’), and sex. Overall, 130 female students (76.9%) and 91 male students (67.4%) reported they had experienced one or more incidents of unwanted sexual activity. Similar numbers of male and female students reported most types of nonconsensual sexual activity; the exception was being felt up, which significantly more female than male students reported.

Students were given a list of 11 possible reasons for engaging in unwanted sex. Overall, perceived reasons for sexual coercion were similar for boys and girls. A substantial number of students reported having unwanted sex to show that they loved their partner (44.2% males, 34.7% females) or because they thought it was what the partners wanted (36.9% females, 35.6% males). Alcohol was also commonly reported as a reason for unwanted sexual activity. More than a quarter of each group (29.8% of males, and 26.9% of females) reported alcohol or drug use to be a main reason for the unwanted sexual activity. Significantly more male students reported having unwanted sexual activity because they thought their friends were doing it (21% males, 10.1% females). Relatively few students, male or female, reported fear of losing a partner, being held down (forced), being threatened with harm, or being hassled as reasons for unwanted sexual activity. Notably, almost as many males as females reported being held down and forced to have sex.

[National Baseline Study on Violence against Children: Philippines](https://www.unicef.org/philippines/reports/national-baseline-study-violence-against-children-philippines)

This study was the first ever national study on violence against children in the Philippines. Overall, 3,866 children and youth aged 13-24 years from 172 barangays in 17 regions of the country, participated in this survey. Among them, 1,979 were males and 1,887 were females.

The researchers sexual violence as “taking photos or sex videos of being naked or engaging in sexual activities, unwanted touch, forced attempted sex, and forced consummated sex.” The first two include someone forcing the child to make the pictures or videos as well as the child doing it himself. 24.7 percent of males, compared with 18.2 percent of females, reported experiencing sexual violence.

About 3.2 percent of children and youth experienced the most severe form of sexual violence - forced consummated sex (anal, oral, and/or vaginal) during childhood. The prevalence for males was 4.1 percent, significantly higher than the 2.3 percent among females who experienced forced consummated sex.

[Sexual behavior and experience of sexual coercion among secondary school students in three states in North Eastern Nigeria](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-6-310)

This is a 2006 study exploring the reproductive health knowledge, sexual behavior and experience of sexual coercion among secondary school students in North Eastern states of Nigeria. Face-to-face interviews were conducted for 624 consenting students who were randomly selected from eighteen secondary schools using an 83-item structured questionnaire. Data was collected on demographic profile, reproductive health knowledge, sexual behavior and experience of sexual coercion. Behaviorally specific questions were used on coercion.

They asked respondents whether any of the following ever happened to them: whether ""someone touched your body against your will"", ""someone tricked you in order to have sex with you"", someone tried to force you to have sex"", ""someone forced you to have sex"", ""someone beat you for refusing to have sex with him/her"" ""someone gave you drugs in order to have sex with you"".

They found that more males than females reported being victims of sexual coercion. Table 5 shows the proportion of students who had experienced sexual coercion by gender.

||Male|Female|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Report any form of coercion|120 (37%)|104 (35%)|224 (36%)|

[Sexual Aggression among Brazilian College Students: Prevalence of Victimization and Perpetration in Men and Women](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232227972_Sexual_Aggression_among_Brazilian_College_Students_Prevalence_of_Victimization_and_Perpetration_in_Men_and_Women)

This research measured the prevalence of sexual aggression and victimization since age 14 among 742 first-year college students in Brazil (411 women). A Portuguese version of the Short Form of the Sexual Experiences Survey was administered to collect information from men and women as both victims and perpetrators of sexual aggression.

""Reports for the past 12 months and the period from age 14 up to 12 months ago were combined to yield an index of prevalence since age 14. The combined prevalence rate of victimization for the two time windows (past 12 months; since age 14 up to the past 12 months) was 27% among men and 29% among women across all aggressive strategies and sexual acts. In the total sample, verbal pressure was the most frequently reported aggressive strategy (19.3%), followed by exploitation of the victim’s inability to offer resistance (13.6%), and the threat or use of physical force (4.9%). Comparing men and women, the prevalence rates were, respectively, 16.4% and 22% for verbal coercion, 15.8% and 12% for exploitation of the victim’s incapacitated state, and 4.6% and 5.1% for threat or use of physical force. None of these rates differed significantly by gender.""

To obtain a nonredundant index of each participant’s victimisation and perpetration status, respondents were classified according to the most severe form of sexual victimisation they reported, using a scoring procedure proposed by Koss and colleagues:

1: Sexual contact (without penetration) through the use of verbal pressure, exploitation of victim’s intoxicated state, threat or use of physical force, but no attempted sexual coercion, sexual coercion, attempted rape, or completed rape.

2: Attempted sexual coercion, that is, attempted oral, vaginal, or anal penetration using verbal pressure, but no sexual coercion, attempted rape, or completed rape.

3: Sexual coercion, that is, completed oral, vaginal, or anal penetration using verbal pressure, but no attempted rape or completed rape.

4: Attempted rape, that is, attempted oral, vaginal, or anal penetration through exploitation of victim’s intoxicated state or threat or use of physical force, but no completed rape.

5: Completed rape, that is, completed oral, vaginal, or anal penetration through exploitation of victim’s intoxicated state or threat or use of physical force.

Because men had significantly more sexual partners than did women, this variable needed to be controlled to avoid a confound between gender and sexual activity. While they found that nonredundant victimisation rates were significantly higher among women for sexual coercion and attempted sexual coercion, even when controlling for number of partners, no significant gender differences were found for sexual contact and for the more severe forms of attempted rape and rape. 2.9% of women and 1.5% of men experienced attempted rape, and 5.1% of women and 5.8% of men experienced completed rape.

Among those men who reported at least one episode of victimization, 65% answered the item about sex of perpetrator. Of those, 72% were victimized only by women, 16% only by men, and 12% by both men and women. Among the female victims, 67% indicated the sex of the perpetrator. Of those, 96.3% were assaulted only by men, 1.2% only by women, and 2.5% by both sexes.

However, this study found a larger gender gap in perpetration, with far more males having reported perpetration than females.

[Experience of sexual coercion and risky sexual behavior among Ugandan university students](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-11-527)

In 2005, 980 (80%) out of a total of 1,220 students enrolled in Mbarara University of Science and Technology in Uganda participated in a self-administered questionnaire covering socio-demographic and religious factors, social capital, mental health, alcohol use, and sexual behaviour.

Experience of sexual coercion was based on a response of ""yes"" to any of the following questions: ""You have been *forced* to show your sexual organ"", ""Someone has *forced* you to let them touch your sexual organ"", ""Someone *forced* you to let them suck or lick your sexual organ"", ""Someone has *forced* you to let them show you their own sexual organ"", ""You have been *forced* to watch someone masturbate"", ""You have been *forced* to masturbate someone"", ""You have been *forced* to take part in oral sex or to lick someone's sexual organ"", ""You have been *forced* to take part in sexual intercourse with the penis in the vagina, or someone has inserted an object into your vagina"", or ""You have been *forced* to pose for a sex photo or sex film"". In the absence of any affirmative answer to the above questions, and with an affirmative answer to the question ""You have not been *forced* into any of these"", the individual was classified as unexposed to sexual coercion.

The reported prevalence was very similar between the sexes: 33.1% for females and 29.9% for males.

""Occurrence of male child rape \[in South Africa:\] Weighted by province and urban/rural areas, 9% (based on 13915/127097) reported forced sex without consent in the last year.

""In response to the question about the sex of the perpetrator, 32% of those who answered (7755/23889) said the perpetrator was male, 41% (weighted value for 9879/23889) said she was female and 26% (6255/23889) said they had been forced to have sex by both male and female perpetrators. Male abuse of schoolboys was much more common in rural areas while female perpetration was more an urban phenomenon.""

""Male schoolchildren in South Africa suffer high rates of sexual abuse, many of the assaults perpetrated in school. By the age of 18 years, two in every five schoolboys reported being forced to have sex, mostly by female perpetrators.""

""This study was a cross-section of children present at sample schools during a single field visit. The anonymous, facilitated self-administered questionnaire prevented registering class members not present at the time of the visit, and no effort was made to contact those who were not present as this would make them identifiable as individuals. It seems reasonable to assume that, if anything, the survey underestimated sexual violence among schoolboys.""

**Commercial sexual exploitation of boys**

[The Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in New York City](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/225082.pdf)

This is a study conducted by John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan on youths working as prostitutes in NYC. When the researchers put out a call for commercially sexually exploited children (CSEC), they ended up with far more boys than they expected. The boys ended up outnumbering the girls to such a degree that the researchers stopped accepting boys and tried to gather more girls who were being pimped.

Yet despite this effort, the researchers still found that almost half of the victims of CSEC were boys. Of the 249 children they included in the study, 119 were girls, 111 were boys, and 19 were transgender. Those results debunk the idea that only or mostly girls are prostitutes.

The researchers reported their own surprise at the large number of boys who showed up to be interviewed for their “self-reporting” study, which was not looking for gender differences. Even though boys had been previously mentioned by some policy makers, practitioners and researchers, this study did not focus on them as a significant segment of the market or on their unique sets of problems. The report said: “While we might argue about the relative proportion of boys versus girls in the sex market, there can be little doubt that boys are far more numerous…than is commonly acknowledged. Policy makers and practitioners who are concerned about the growth of CSEC markets need to account for and respond to all of the youth that are swept into it, yet there is scant discussion about boys, and no services for them at all.""

This is a Norwegian report and is written in Norwegian, but there is an English summary towards the end. ""The Ung i Oslo study, a representative study of approx. 12,000 youths in Oslo, showed that 2.1 percent of the boys and 0.6 percent of the girls had given sexual favours for payment. The mean age for first time sex selling experience was 13.5 years for boys and 14.1 years for girls.""

[Prevalence and correlates of exchanging sex for drugs or money among adolescents in the United States](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563846/)

This study examined the prevalence and correlates of exchanging sex for drugs or money among a nationally representative sample of 13,294 adolescents in the United States. Data was taken from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, waves I and II, and he lifetime prevalence of exchanging sex was estimated and a cross sectional analysis of sociodemographic and behavioural correlates was conducted. They found that two thirds (67.9%) of the youths who exchanged sex were boys.

[Sexual Assault, Overweight, and Suicide Attempts in U.S. Adolescents](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sltb.12148)

The study analyzed data from a Youth and Risk Behavior Survey that sampled more than 31,000 teenagers in 2009 and 2011. The research continued a preliminary study from 2011 that found similar results using a smaller sample of teens. The poll surveyed students ages 14 to 18 and examined whether the two variables influenced suicide attempts within a year of the survey.

What they found was that 3.5 percent of healthy-weight males with no sexual assault history attempted suicide. That percentage climbed to 33.2 percent for healthy-weight males with sexual assault history, which Anderson attributes to stigma, shame, possible gender role conflict if the attacker was male and the lack of an open support system. Weight alone was not a significant factor in suicide attempts for males. Only 3.9 percent of overweight males with no sexual assault history attempted suicide. For males who were both overweight and had a history of sexual assault, the percentage who attempted suicide was 33 percent.

In contrast, 5.8 percent of healthy-weight females with no sexual assault history attempted suicide. The percentage rose to 27.1 percent for healthy-weight girls with a history of sexual assault. Weight influenced the suicide rate among women: 8.2 percent of overweight girls with no sexual assault history attempt suicide. However, both factors did not increase suicide rate: 26.6 percent of overweight girls with sexual assault histories attempted suicide.

**Men are less likely to view to acknowledge their experiences of sexual assault and are less likely to report it, which likely affects data and statistics on the topic.**

""Across the United Kingdom (UK) there has been a steady increase in the number of males who feel confident enough to report their experiences to the police. However, research conducted by SurvivorsUK has suggested that the percentage of men who actually report their experiences is as low as 3.9 per cent.""

""In 2013 a joint piece of work by the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Office for National Statistics suggested that around 20 per cent of victims don’t report incidents of sexual assault and rape to the police. However, these estimates were developed using data on reporting habits collected only from women. This does though show that there is a clear acknowledgement that a large number of victims decide never to inform the police of their experiences.""

""Figures collected from all the UK’s police forces show that between 2010 and 2014 there were 26,483 recorded incidents of males being victims of sexual assault or rape. This includes 3,748 incidents recorded by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) – the highest rate in the UK.""

""Using these figures alongside the research conducted by SurvivorsUK, we can estimate the number of males over the age of 16 who were sexually assaulted or raped between 2010 and 2014, who did not report their experiences to the police.""

""These numbers suggest that across the entire UK between 2010 and 2014, 679,051 sexual assaults and rapes of males took place. Of these – 652,568 were not reported to any police force.""

""In the geographical area covered by the MPS this would equate to 96,103 sexual assaults and rapes of males between 2010 and 2014 – with 92,355 of them not being reported.""

**Discrimination against male victims of sexual assault.**

[Police Perceptions of Rape as Function of Victim Gender and Sexuality](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1350/pojo.2009.82.1.466)

In this study one hundred and twenty-eight United Kingdom police workers of various ranks read a hypothetical rape scenario in which victim gender and victim sexuality were experimentally manipulated before completing a 12-item rape attributions questionnaire focusing on perceptions of victim blame and assault severity. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) were then performed. Overall, police workers were largely pro-victim although, as expected, they were more negative towards male victims than female victims. Contrary to expectations, these trends existed regardless of victim sexuality.

How many braincels do these people have?,"Feminists will treat men like some sort of priviledged group that has hegemony over literally anything else, and proceed to blame their entire problems on the ""Patriarchy"", an unknown entity that forces women to be more oppresed than the Armenians in 1916. 

However, they are quick to blame this mysterious force for all of men's problems (Look at r/FragileMaleRedditor, for example, and look for when they can't disscuss something and start summoning this force as the culprit) even though the word itself says this is impossible.

For starters ""patriarchy"" comes from the words Patria and Archy, the first meaning ""Fatherland"" in this case used simply as ""Father"", and the second means ""To rule"". Basically, you could say ""Patriarchy"" means ""Father to rule"" thus implying ""Fathers"" or in this case men in general have a total  paramountcy hover society.

And so, how the sacred fuck does this hypotetical force manage to turn on it's conjurers and somehow cause them to be called gay for wearing a little bit of pink in their shirts? How and why does this esse somehow and magically make men way more likely to kill themselves, if it in theory just makes men live like kings?

MRA TOOLKIT: The myth of women being discriminated in health care or talking about women not being tested in clinical trials (quick post you can copy and paste),"# INTRODUCTION

&gt;Copy and paste this (and thats it) if posters make the above claims, stop wasting your valuable time and energy arguing with feminists making long posts (leave that to anti feminsits e.g. Karen Straughan, becauseits2015, unless of course its your area of expertise, passion or you have talent in it) focus your time instead on activism eg. writing letters (MRAs get things changed all the time with literally one letter or one tweet.... people here don't follow MRA on the ground enough they have thousands of victories). Arguing with a coffee shop feminist on reddit with no power and likely no even real yniderstanding of feminism is"" HIGH effort, LOW yield result"" work.... a 10 minute letter to a company, organisation, school or whatever maybe correcting a journalist on false stats etc is low/moderate effort higher yield... also the positive effect you get when you send a letter and get a reply (and you usually do get a good reply, dont listen to negativity here) reinforces you to do it again.... then post your letter here, which encourages others... see 10x better use of your time than debating Brenda the coffee shop feminist on reddit. I admit I post a lot, but im doing it on breaks and I do enjoy it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also remember when you debate, you are debating for the audience NOT the radical (who is unlikely to change their mind).... thats why be polite, dont lose it, and it doesnt matter if they dont agree, you are arguing for the moderates who will see your argument laid out..... this how people are red pilled

But as I said, dont waste your time doing it, no point!!

# Here Is The Copy and Paste Post: 

Of course women have MANY issues in healthcare and many cases of being let down. As do men. The narrative of \*specifically\* female ""oppression"" or ""systemic neglect"" in way not experienced by others however is a false narrative\*\* Again no one is saying there aren''t issues but the overriding narrative is false. What causes this flawed view? See the last link in this post for why. But first:

**Women not treated as seriously by drs?**

Again huge feminsit talking point and myth:

&gt;Emily Dwass’ opinion piece repeats the charge that female patients’ complaints are ignored by doctors because of their gender.Her impression is not supported by research into this issue. A large nationwide review, which examined 46,868 office visits, revealed that the care received by men and women was similar about two-thirds of the time. When the care was different, women overall received more diagnostic tests and treatment — more lab tests, blood-pressure checks, drug prescriptions, and return appointments.In the United States, we spend twice as much on the healthcare of women than on that of men. Even if you exclude obstetrical care, females at every age receive more medical attention than males. The charge that the healthcare of women is neglected because of their gender needs to be evaluated in that context.*Andrew G. Kadar, M.D., Beverly Hills*

Plus most men percieve it as something offensive. Although 'semantically' its correct, it is not helpful. Even the word 'negro' was used to refer to black african people but ultimately became offensive.

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341832524\_Reactions\_to\_contemporary\_narratives\_about\_masculinity\_A\_pilot\_study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341832524_Reactions_to_contemporary_narratives_about_masculinity_A_pilot_study)

This study did a survey in which about 80% men found the word toxic masculinity as not helpful.

Why should we use a word which is not seen as helpful and seen as offensive? It feels like its okay to be sexist against men. Another example is of the word 'retarded' which semantally was a normal word but got banned.

'Since the word has become commonly used in informal speech, it is harder to see the connection between the original word meaning and the current informal use of the word. For this reason, it may be difficult to understand why the word is still considered offensive. The definition of the word retarded, according to Merriam-Webster dictionary is “Offensive: slow or limited in intellectual or emotional development”. At one point in time “mental retardation” was a medical term used to describe a person with an intellectual disability. However, since then the word has been replaced by the term “intellectual disability” because it is more accurate and accepting. The r-word is an exclusive term that furthers negative stereotypes about people with disabilities. It can be hurtful whether it is directed towards a person with a disability or when used as a synonym for “dumb” or “stupid”. When used in this way it is equivalent to saying people with disabilities are stupid. In addition, the real message of the sentence is lost because the r-word has a completely different meaning than the words “stupid” or “dumb”. There are many other words to choose from instead of the r-word that will better represent the intended meaning.'",1,0,"['According', 'to', 'the', 'The', 'Palgrave', 'Handbook', 'of', 'Male', 'Psychology', 'and', 'Mental', 'Health', 'the', 'word', 'toxic', 'masculinity', 'has', 'no', 'clinical', 'value', 'and', 'is', 'an', 'example', 'of', 'another', 'cognitive', 'distortion', 'called', 'negative', 'labelling', 'usually', 'have', 'a', 'negative', 'impact', 'such', 'as', 'alienation', 'of', 'affected', 'groups']","According to the The Palgrave Handbook of Male Psychology and Mental Health , the word toxic masculinity has no clinical value and is an example of another cognitive distortion called negative labelling usually have a negative impact such as alienation of affected groups."
Is this sub about hating women or just the unfair advantages extreme feminism has introduced into modern society?,"It’s pretty fair to say that for most of history, patriarchal values have placed women as second rate within most societies. Traditional gender roles, women not able to own property, right to vote, wage gaps. I know a lot of those things no longer apply in modern times but other forms of discrimination and disadvantages exist for women (victim shaming, abortion/birth control rights, wage gap still, sexual assault/harassment). Yes I know that men are also subject to many of these things but that does not diminish what women face, and vice versa. None of it is fair for anyone, and one side facing any obstacles does not make it justifiable or less significant for the other. My point being that women are fighting for change to balance the scales that have been against them for so long. My question is if this sub has become a place to attempt to keep women in their place and upholding one unfair status quo by labeling feminist activism as the opposite end of the spectrum. So are you all here advocating for equal fairness, or not? 

Browsing through this sub, I see some posts and perspectives that I can agree with. I don’t personally think women should be given the upper hand and advantage in all facets of society over men. I can agree that extreme feminism has mutated into something just as bad, just for their side/benefit and to me that is wrong. Society should be equally balanced end story. What troubles me about this sub are the posts that have become so inflamed at the idea of a woman even coming close to equal status of a man that it’s not a matter of equality but the evil workings of extreme, unreasonable feminism at play.",8,0,"['Is', 'this', 'sub', 'about', 'hating', 'women', 'or', 'just', 'the', 'unfair', 'advantages', 'extreme', 'feminism', 'has', 'introduced', 'into', 'modern', 'society']",Is this sub about hating women or just the unfair advantages extreme feminism has introduced into modern society?

My opinions on feminism/men’s rights etc;,"(This post is just me ranting or gathering my thoughts tbh)

In regards to the men’s rights movement, I believe that too many members of r/mensrights are anti-women and this makes them just as bad as women, they are like the reverse of feminism, ‘equal but opposite’ is the best way to describe it. They hunt for any reason to attack feminism or more dangerously women as a whole

However, in regards to feminism, I believe that feminists live in ignorance. Oblivious to the fact that men can be oppressed too. Their idea is that all oppression against men can be ‘debunked’ by the fact that women were oppressed much more so than men in previous generations. This idea stays with feminsm today, that women are still ‘more oppressed’ than men.
This myth can very easily be debunked too though, it is the idea that one oppression cancels out another. If someone tells you that it’s impossible to be sexist to men, ask them
“Were Jews oppressed when nazi Germany killed them in their millions simply for their religion?”
The answer will most likely be yes
“But what about the Jews in Israel who are persecuting the Palestinians for being Muslim? Who is oppressed there?”
“But what about the Muslims in Saudi Arabia who are persecuting African migrants in ‘covid detention centres?’
(This should dispel any beliefs of one oppression cancelling another out, relying on the fact that the person has listened and is not in the process of tweeting about you right now)
Although risky, this is the best analogy I can think of

"Biologically engrained, I found the answer","A little long but easy to follow.

Women like men who can protect them (or have traits of that), and want to mate them. 
They have the best chance of survival with the more powerful males.

Men want to mate with the best partner they can find for the best chance at surviving their offspring, so they do whatever the partners find most valuable which is being strong, protective, and risk dying for them. 

This is engrained biologically, because biologically we want to reproduce as a species or any species for that matter. Otherwise they would cease to exist and humans are quite successful as a species.

Therefore:
Men are more powerful (thus leaders), they protect more (thus risk their lives for their mate/children), etc.

Men are engrained to protect the women, because they think it will bring sex to pass offspring.

But women as a whole don't biologically (subconsciously) care about ""protection"" by supporting feminism, they subconsciously want the man that will best give them the best chance of survival, a man with powerful features.

And when women cannot find a partner that can give them this protection, they rely on the collective whole to protect them, hence feminism.

Fear is pushed, and any men that don't like feminism, don't want to protect women. 
There is a collective ""need"" for feminism to pass on children.

Incels offer no biological reasoning to mate for offspring and there is no collective reasons for the survival of the species.
They are hated the worst.

Male feminists offer a collective need to keep them, but no biological desire in a woman's eyes.
They are friends but not mates for offspring.

Men who go off dying or risking their lives for their partner and family that they have, dont care as much about feminism.

Women who have a partner willing to die for them, or partner with power, care about feminism to an extent, their partner can't protect them 24/7. 

Women who deeply care about feminism, fight it so hard because they know they won't be able to find a partner to protect them, they require the collective whole (feminism) to protect them.",1,0,"['Biologically', 'engrained', 'I', 'found', 'the', 'answer']","Biologically engrained, I found the answer"

On Gratitude,"From time to time we get posts from people who are desperately depressed because of the seeming impossibility of getting a fair deal for men, because they have been divorce raped, because they have been falsely accused or for some other reason.


Of all the spiritual practices which might help the one with the highest reward/effort ratio is probably the practice of gratitude.


It is a simple practice to get into the habit of, and there are many ways to do it. In days gone by, people used to express gratitude for food before eating, but this has fallen by the wayside along with belief in God. Nonetheless, taking time to appreciate things is a worthwhile activity.


You can do it by deliberately thinking of something or several things to be grateful for at the end of the day. For a while our family kept a jar of notes that we would add to each time there was something special worth remembering. From time to time we would open it and read them. This had the added bonus of reminding us to do things we had enjoyed before.


As a trainer on a back to work scheme, I used to get the group to come up with something at the beginning of each day. While I couldn’t measure it, I am sure that this made the whole programme much more positive. (These courses tend to be a bit negative since the participants are compelled to attend on pain of losing their benefits.)


What I also found was that many of them could not come up with anything, although I could fire of half a dozen things for them (living in Australia, being in good health, free Internet in the library, benefits while not working,  etc.) After a while, most people got the hang of it and started recognizing the good things in their lives without taking them for granted.

It is an easy habit to get into and one which, if practiced habitually will tend to guard against depression and increase happiness. It being New Year's now might be a good time to start this habit.

Edit: while on the subject of New Year's resolutions, if you resolve to give up smoking, people will come up to you at five past midnight and casually offer you a cigarette. So every year, I resolve to give up oral intercourse. This may not work for everyone.

Bothered by how normalized male circumcision is AKA genital mutilation,"I've never realized how normalized male circumcision is which is just another form of genital mutilation. FYI I'm circumcised but not for the reason you may think and it was medically necessary in fact I'm pretty sure I'm the only male in the family that is circumcised lol. Back to the topic however I am just starting to realizing how normalized even glorified male circumcision is. Something that is permanent and essentially conformed on infants without consent. 

I know this is a shitty example but I was scrolling through the hub today and saw this comment here it is word for word, "" **Wow girl you are lucky... Your man is circumcised so tight the remaining skin on his shaft cant even be pulled up into the same zip code as the base of his glans. Does it turn you on to know that your mans cock was permanently altered to the extreme, the head of his dick removed from its protective sheath and significantly desensitized by 24/7 exposure to friction all for your enjoyment. And the icing on the cake his frenulum, the male g spot, 100% carved out. I bet he can fuck for hours**."" I know that this is a shitty example but reading this just made me sick to my stomach and it the very first time I viewed a circumcised cock in disgust in fact I've lost my appetite just by reading this. I have a link but I don't want to post it unless you guys actually want me to prove it and it's not a gore video btw. This is just one of many different ways I've seen how circumcision is normalized but even glorified. 

Even though I'm circumcised I never really thought of it much and I never really viewed it as necessary but after reading this comment it only reaffirmed it more. If I do have a son in the future I will make sure that he does not get circumcised unless it is actually medically necessary but even then I will try to find potential alternatives if possible. I know that this is a dumb comment from a random video on a porn website but it shows just how menial it seems to many people in society. I know many women as well as men that support this practice and it's just disheartening. The good news is that circumcision rates are declining in the U.S and many parts of the world(except in certain areas due to culture/religion) but the way circumcision is brushed over makes me quite sad and angry.",19,0,"['Bothered', 'by', 'how', 'normalized', 'male', 'circumcision', 'is', 'AKA', 'genital', 'mutilation']",Bothered by how normalized male circumcision is AKA genital mutilation
Road of Bones: A hidden gendercide,"[A road in Siberia](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/11/16/russian-town-dusts-highway-with-human-bones-a72055) , known as the [road of death](https://archive.org/details/KolymaUncut), that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives of prisoners to build. I suspect they were totally or primarily male deaths. Anyone know any gender information on this?

&amp;#x200B;

I've found a couple of quotes more generally that might imply males in heavier work, and I'm aware some females were sent to forestry and mining.  

""As a rule, men were separated from their families and sent to do hard labor. Women, children, and the elderly were left without means for survival. Terrible conditions, hunger, and hard labor caused high mortality, particularly among children."" (Khlevniuk 2004)

""Perhaps because of the camp commanders’ objections, the numbers of women who were actually sent to camps always remained relatively low (as did the number of women executed during the 1937–38 purge). According to the official statistics, for example, only about 13 percent of Gulag prisoners in the year 1942 were women. This went up to 30 percent in 1945, due in part to the enormous number of male prisoners drafted and sent to the front, and also to the laws forbidding workers to leave their factory—laws which led to the arrest of many young women.8 In 1948 it was 22 percent, falling again to 17 percent in 1951 and 1952.9 Still, even these numbers fail to reflect the true situation, as women were far more likely to be assigned to serve their sentences in the light-regime “colonies.” In the large, industrial camps of the far north, they were even fewer, their presence even rarer."" (Applebaum 2003) This book by Applebaum has a chapter on women and children. No chapter focusing on men yet they were the majority victims of gulags.

Youtube: Misandry at the UN and WHO - Regarding Men: and the UN's World Toilet Day,"Yesterday someone posted a link to this video...

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5tZyiQeNzw
* **Misandry at the UN and WHO - Regarding Men**

It's well worth the watch. For some reason the OP deleted the post.

In it we have a guest speaker, James Nuzzo posting evidence of how the UN is sexist against men. In one segment he lists the special days recognized by the UN, and one them was *International Women's Day*. Warren Farrel mentions *International Men's Day* (neither created by or recognized by the UN) and James Nuzzo mentions that the UN does recognize something on Nov 19 (IMD), and that's *World Toilet Day*. Warren Farrel mentioned that he once tried to look up whether they came up with *World Toilet Day* after IMD was created, as an insult to IMD. So I decided to look it up.

When was IMD started?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Men%27s_Day

* **History**

* **Inaugurated in 1992 on 7 February** by Thomas Oaster,[4] the project of International Men's Day was conceived one year earlier on 8 February 1991.[5] The project was re-initialised in 1999 in Trinidad and Tobago.[6] The longest running celebration of International Men's Day is Malta, where events have occurred since 7 February 1994.[7] Now as Malta was the only country that observed the February date of celebrating Men and their contribution to the society, the Maltese AMR Committee voted in 2009 to shift the date for IMD to 19th November.[8]

* Jerome Teelucksingh, who revived the event, chose 19 November to honour his father's birthday and also to celebrate how on that date in 1989 Trinidad and Tobago's football team had united the country with their endeavours to qualify for the World Cup.[9][10] Teelucksingh has promoted International Men's Day as not just a gendered day but a day where all issues affecting men and boys can be addressed. He has said of IMD and its grass roots activists, ""They are striving for gender equality and patiently attempt to remove the negative images and the stigma associated with men in our society"".[11] 

When did the UN come up with *World Toilet Day*?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Toilet_Day

* Observed by:	worldwide
* Date:	19 November
* Frequency:	annual
* First time:	19 November 2001 (unofficially) and 19 November 2012 (as an official UN Day)
* Related to:	UN-Water (convener), World Toilet Organization (initiator)

So the UN came up with WTD in 2001, 9 years after WMD was inaugurated.

I think that spells out pretty clearly what the UN thinks of WMD.

The Wikipedia article lists why WTD is so important.

* Toilets are important because access to a safe functioning toilet has a positive impact on public health, human dignity, and personal safety, **especially for women**.",8,0,"['Youtube', 'Misandry', 'at', 'the', 'UN', 'and', 'WHO', 'Regarding', 'Men', 'and', 'the', 'UN', 's', 'World', 'Toilet', 'Day']",Youtube: Misandry at the UN and WHO - Regarding Men: and the UN's World Toilet Day

Child Support/Alienation advice,"So without diving too deep and personal and disclosing the novel which is my life story ..I'm gunna  try to keep it simple.

I have been alienated from my children for almost 10yrs now. I've done the best I could to keep going and move on with my life with the hope that one day it will be made right. I've suffered so much over the years. Not just from crippling depression and trauma from being helplessly ripped out of my children's life, but also financial ruin. Child support has made it impossible for me to get anywhere in life. I've been homeless multiple times because of it...Lost jobs because of it... vehicles...my license...even been jailed for falling behind.

I just found out through a friend, who did some social media snooping for me, that my ex (the baby momma) has just bought a house. A nice one too. It's big, 3 car garage, large in-ground pool, 2 kitchens, nice suburban neighborhood, you get the point. 

Obviously my ex has come into a large amount of money. From what I have been able to see on casenet, she been battling in civil court for the past several years. But I can't find out the outcome or details because it doesn't disclose that info, plus apparently it was sent to federal court. But my hypothesis is she won a large settlement.

Meanwhile here I am...poor af, living in squallor, well below poverty level. They garnish at least 60% of my pay. Tax returns, stimulus check, all intercepted. I am constantly facing eviction and utility shut offs because I just can't make enough to survive, much less get ahead or save up. I walk over a mile to work in rain, snow, cold, and heat because they suspended my license, not that I can afford to even own a car anyway. Every day is a struggle...and there's no end in sight. I try very hard to stay strong, to be humble and thankful. Some days are better than others obviously, but overall I been pretty good about not letting things get to me so much and making the best of what I have.

I'm not even jealous. Obviously, like it would be to anyone else, it is kinda a blow to the gut. Feels completely unfair. But life is not fair. But honestly, I am glad to know that my kids are well provided for and getting to live the good life. 

So what I am wondering is whether this could affect the child support amount? I can't afford to even get on my feet, and she just bought a huge house (well over $500k). All I have wanted and been trying to do is build a life, one that is stable, one that I could have my kids in again. But I struggle to just keep my electric on and food in the fridge.

 Is there something I should do? Or can do even? Is it even worth it? I can't afford a lawyer. But anyone out there got any advice or suggestions? Thank you for reading.",7,0,"['Child', 'Support', 'Alienation', 'advice']",Child Support/Alienation advice
We need to make our 36th birthdays a cause for celebration. (to raise awareness),"In the US the maximum age of conscription is 35. This means that when you turn 36 you are home free from being sent to foreign lands to get your guts blown out. I feel like bringing attention (by celebration) to this important milestone could raise some awareness of how fucked up the whole thing is. 

I'm in Canada and here it is 45 years old. I'm 6 months away from having this potential burden lifted from my mind. I was 7 years old when on remembrance day my mother told me about how awful war was. My first question was ""Why would any man choose to go to war?"" Her response was that they have no choice because they are conscripted by force. She also told me that most/many generations of young men had been made to go through this and there was a chance this could apply to me when I was grown up.  I said I would refuse. She informed me of the consequences to which I replied ""I will hide"". I can't remember how the rest of the convo went but I remember being scared (I was 7 and yes it was borderline abuse on her part to tell me these things at that age but my mom was a straight shooter).

To the young men here: develop a strong frame,"I'm seeing a lot of sentiment on this sub lately that reads like this: ""I feel hated for being a man, I feel lesser for being a man, I feel sub-human for any reason whatsoever"" 

I wanted to take a moment and address this type of thinking for all you young and impressionable guys on this sub. 

Firstly this is a mental health issue, not a men's right's issue. YOUR personal worldview is YOUR responsibility. 

- Internet algorithms are going to feed you crap that triggers you or keeps your eyeballs on the page, NOT the truth

- What you hear on the news or on reddit is typically extremism

- No one is going to hold your hand and remind you of the above, so begin to practice healthy skepticism of everything you read on reddit

I advocate all men here, especially young men, to become aware and cultivate your frame.

Do you live in a warm, friendly universe? A place where strangers are rooting for your success? 

Or do you live in a dark place where all women and the media and public and reddit are all rooting for your demise, simply because you are a man?

Decide what you think the truth is, question it to see if it holds up from different angles, and then stick to it despite what headlines tell you.

For example, ""kill all men"" and the idea that women hate men is toxic. We can debate whether 20% of women believe this or 80% do. So what about the other group? That group of silent women you never read about, who sympathetically understand the struggle of men and want us to have equal rights? You don't see them because you don't look for them, because our mind sees only what we look for.

Your frame is a *choice*. Either your subconscious runs it (99% of men) or you take charge and decide what it is (1% of men).

Take charge and start focusing on the various groups of women and men out there who want you to succeed, and FEEL EMPOWERED to tackle the struggles that we face as men.",12,0,"['To', 'the', 'young', 'men', 'here', 'develop', 'a', 'strong', 'frame']",To the young men here: develop a strong frame

Are my parents right about this?,"Hi I am a 23 year old woman and feminist with a personal question.
I've got the opportunity to be a model for a body positivity, lgtbq+ friendly overall amazing underwear brand (La Fille D'O). The style of the photographer and also owner of the brand is very direct; with visible nipples, hair and everything.

I am an artist myself and my work is very much about the female experience especially about sexualization of our body. I go completely nude for my own photography, paintings and performance all the time. So even without this shoot my body is out there, in a direct way.

I told my parents the news I would be doing this shoot. They had no problem with me modelling as a lingerie model, but they have a problem with this brand because it is too nude, too direct, overall not pretty. They came with the following arguments;

- what would the rest of my family think?

- What if I needed another job which won't appreciate the nudity?

- I would make their life harder by doing this shoot because they would have to face my family and, wait for it, their colleagues. My father even fears losing his job because of these hypothetical pictures.

This last one really stuck with me. Aren't they just making me feel guilty for living my life, which I try to live in an empowering way?

I am wondering what you think? Is there any way I would really be such a burden? Is this a valid reason for a 23 year old to feel guilty, maybe even hesitating doing the shoot to begin with.



I hope this is the right place to ask this. Thanks!",16,1,"['Are', 'my', 'parents', 'right', 'about', 'this']",Are my parents right about this?

*Constructive attitude* - No history of hate speech including transphobia, ableism, ageism, sexism etc

*Ability to work individually and with a team* -  our moderation team functions in English. While fluency in other languages is very welcome a junior mod should be able communicate constructively with an English speaking team.

*Account age, preferred pronouns*. We won’t be able to accept new accounts or those with little to no post history.
