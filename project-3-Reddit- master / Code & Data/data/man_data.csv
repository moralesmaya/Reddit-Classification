Black men matter,"Now before you read the title and downvote, let me clarify something. Yes, I know that the male experience is not exclusive to black men. I‚Äôm a white guy myself. But the hardest hit group by the modern war on men is almost certainly black men. Think about most of the issues that negatively affect men more than women: disproportionate sentencing, capital punishment, police brutality, fatherless homes, false rape accusations, homelessness, homicide, suicide... the list goes on and on. These issues, be they societal or legal, are often exacerbated for black men. Take sentencing disparities for example. In the US, 1 in 111 white women are in prison. Meanwhile, 1 in 17 white men are in prison. Pretty bad disparity, right? Now get this: 1 in 3 black men are in prison.

What are the reasons for this? Well above all else, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs all about being perceived as a threat. Men are more likely to be seen as threats than women. I think the fine folks here understand that well. For black men, this issue is once again exacerbated. Nothing pleases a racist, misandrist judge more than seeing a young black man being ‚Äútaken off the streets‚Äù because he‚Äôs seen as a threat. And this perception also frequently manifests itself in the form of police homicide. It‚Äôs how a police officer can walk into a random, law-abiding citizen‚Äôs own apartment and [shoot him to death](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Botham_Jean) while he‚Äôs sitting on his couch because she thinks he‚Äôs an intruder. Btw, that police officer will be eligible for parole after just five years, and she‚Äôs currently appealing to have the murder charge dropped altogether. How‚Äôs that for ‚Äúmale privilege‚Äù?

Anyway, the point of this post is not to create division. Once again, I think that white and black men both experience hardships due to our sex. And I‚Äôm not trying to imply that every woman is racist against black men, or misandrist as a whole. My point is just that we should be aware of the experiences of our black brothers, and stand with them as they battle racial inequality in addition to misandry.",1,0

Have you guys ever faced discrimination from the healthcare system that you felt was because you are male?,"I was doing some research on healthcare discrimination recently, which is when certain groups of people do not receive the same diagnosis as other groups, or whose symptoms are not taken seriously, which could lead to further complications.

When I was researching, however, I noticed that it was mostly focused on discrimination that women face in the healthcare system, which basically boils down to them having a hard time being taken seriously by doctors and receiving wrong diagnoses or no diagnoses at all. Even wikipedia's article on ""Gender bias in medical diagnosis"" only talks about how men are taken more seriously than women.

When I read that, I was like ""wait, that can't be right..."" There is no way men are more privileged in the healthcare system than women. To say that would also imply that people take the emotions of men seriously, their problems seriously, or just overall giving a shit about the well-being of men in general, which society has proven time and time again that it does not.          

For me, personally, I broke one of my toes in a basketball game. Even though I could clearly feel that it was broken, and I told the doctors how much it hurt, they just simply thought I could tough it out with an icepack and some rest. Walking on it for several days after that made it even worse, to the point where I finally needed surgery that I might not have needed if they took it seriously in the first place. 

So I wanna ask: What forms of medical discrimination do you face in the healthcare system, such as doctors appointments, hospitals, or getting a diagnosis in a disease or mental illness. Can you tell that that discrimination was from the fact that you are male? Do you feel that issues pertaining exclusively to us men, such as testicular complications, testosterone problems, erectile dysfunction, or even kidney stones (yeah, I know women get them too, but men statistically get them at a higher rate).?         

For the sake of simplicity, lets not talk about male genital mutilation (ahem, I mean ""circumcision""), since we all already know how big of an issue that is.",1,0
Sexist Training in the workplace,"So I work for a very large global company. I was part of a training session that included a guest speaker who was a woman in a very senior role. It was a fantastic presentation, very insightful and forward looking.


In the Q&amp;A afterwards, an audience member decides to ask the ‚ÄúAs a woman leader...‚Äù question, which just ended up leaving a bad taste in my mouth.


The point this leader focused on was essentially ‚Äúwe allocated 30 mins for questions after my presentation. The first 6 questions asked were asked by men. Women wait to ask questions. So to women: don‚Äôt wait [good advice] and to those who tend to ask questions quickly, try waiting before speaking up.‚Äù

Do you think it‚Äôs possible that women are actually the perverts of society?,"How did men‚Äôs value come to be only what he can provide for a woman?

I think it‚Äôs funny cause this girl I was talking to who was super Christian was completely astounded at the fact that I wanted an emotional connection with my partner before having sex.

Men who believe that masculinity is toxic or harmful have lower self-esteem and worse metal health than men who embrace their masculinity as a good thing,"Psychology has historically done a poor job studying men and masculinity.  At best it strives for a one size fits all approach, and at worse it has tried to contextualize everything through the eyes of women and femininity.

In such a model, men are treated as if they were defective women.  The belief is that they suffer from mental health problems in part because they are men, or because masculinity has harmful or toxic elements to it.

It turns out though that men who adopt these beliefs actually have worse mental health than men who embrace their masculinity and see it as a good thing.  In addition they have worse relationships with women, with their families, their friends, and they engage in drug use and alcohol more often than men who reject this view.

Obviously this is just a correlation. But given the APA's [formal (and dare I say *toxic*) stance on masculinity](http://empathygap.uk/?p=2735), I think there are things that we're not looking at right now.

Men cry less because they deal with things differently than women, not because they're repressing their emotions. And those differences might be productive and healthy for them.

The key to better mental health for men might be a healthy respect for masculinity, not a shunning of it.  Instead of trying to redefine masculinity, we should work to understand it better, and offer better services for men based on an honest acknowledgement that men's and women's mental health might require different approaches.

Men are not ""defective women"", and treating men's mental health in that context does not seem to be working very well.

A few sources (with quotes):

&gt;The other dogma, Pinker argued, 'is that repressing emotions is bad and expressing them is good ‚Äì a folk theory with roots in romanticism, Freudian psychoanalysis, and Hollywood, **but which is contradicted by a large literature showing that people with greater self-control, particularly those who repress anger rather than ‚Äúventing,‚Äù lead healthier lives**: they get better grades, have fewer eating disorders, drink less, have fewer psychosomatic aches and pains, are less depressed, anxious, phobic, and paranoid, have higher self-esteem, are more conscientious, have better relationships with their families, have more stable friendships, are less likely to have sex they regretted, and are less likely to imagine themselves cheating in a monogamous relationship.‚Äô

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/apa-guidelines-men-boys.html

&gt;Further analysis using multiple linear regression found that men‚Äôs self-esteem was significantly predicted by older age, more education, and a greater acceptance of traditional masculinity. **Men‚Äôs mental positivity ‚Äì which is known to be negatively correlated with suicidality ‚Äì was significantly predicted by older age, a greater acceptance of traditional masculinity, and more education.**

https://zenodo.org/record/3871217#.X-p1ji2l2J_

&gt;When in distress, women tend to want to talk about their feelings whereas men tend to want to fx whatever is causing the distress (Holloway et al. 2018). **However our mental health services are delivered in a ‚Äúgender blind‚Äù way, so that treatment options that might suit men better are rarely considered (Liddon et al. 2017).**

https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_5

In addition, the APA has discovered that **""many men report experiencing gender bias in therapy""** and **""investigations have identified systemic gender bias toward adult men in psychotherapy""**.  So maybe if our mental health services viewed masculinity in a better light, men would receive better care.

Asking for advice in avoiding the wrong type of woman.,"So, being on this sub for a long time has given me a lot of paranoia regarding women. Specifically, avoiding them. I personally lack a lot of social skills, being a social outcast for most of my high school life and even in college. I have friends who were falsely accused of rape and had their lives ruined because of these allegations (one killed himself because he was completely ostracised, even from his family).

I have started living on my own in an unfamiliar environment and was wondering if there are general red flags to look for or just advice like that on avoiding the type of woman who would falsely accuse me of certain actions. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes. I got to the shoe aisle, and noticed immediately that there was a designated ladies‚Äô shoes section, a designated kids shoes section... and that was it. There‚Äôs literally no men‚Äôs shoes section. Slightly annoyed at this, I figured they were probably just hidden against the back wall on the opposite side of the kids section from the ladies shoes. And they were. Kind of. There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second. Why on earth is there a section of women‚Äôs boots smack dab in the middle? It‚Äôs on the exact other side of the shoe section from the ladies shoes. The heck is this? How painful are they going to make shoe shopping? I just want one decent pair of shoes. And the guys selection is so narrow that if it‚Äôs not freakin cowboy style steel toed boots, it‚Äôs classy dress shoes that you would like wear to a wedding. The heck happened to all the sneakers? Oh wait there‚Äôs one brand of sneakers with maybe three sizes available, even though the shelves are clearly fully stocked.

(Most) Gay men are on your side,"I'm a 29 year old guy. Been openly gay since I was 12. When I say gay, I don't mean a stereotypical  obnoxious, narcissistic attention seeker at ""pride"" (shame). I mean I am just a regular guy who happens to be into guys. If you passed me in the street, you would just think me any normal bloke and if you remain a regular associate of mine it's highly likely a few years before the penny drops and you realise I'm gay.

I want all of you to know that all men (and women in fact, but this is not about them) share the burden of the current social climate. I hate being lumped in with the ""gay community"" because to me it's gone so loopy and so far aligned with feminist/gender ideology that to be associated with it is an embarrassment. Please understand there are countless other gay men just like me who are the silent majority. We aren't all insufferable narcissists trying to join the coven. 

I've been in a stable relationship with my partner for 5 years now and we really do have the most wonderful, equal and loving relationship. Both of us are so aghast at the current state of ""liberal"" politics to the point we've resolved to eventually getting a place in the country and becoming self-sufficient so we can watch the world burn from afar.

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in this particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably deep due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. 

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Toxic masculinity ruining men‚Äôs mental health. Sexual assault on men is serious too.,"I could write a whole book on this; mens rights, and toxic masculinity. But one thing that I do not understand, is the perception to many women I try and talk to (I don‚Äôt force these topics, this just happens when they come up) that I‚Äôm against women‚Äôs rights, and ‚Äúcan not say this because I‚Äôve never felt true oppression‚Äù. I‚Äôm not even saying oppression here. What I‚Äôm saying, is that I think rights should be equal across the board. Women‚Äôs rights does good things. BLM does good things. Many movements do good things, but supporting mens rights does not make me a fascist conservative. I look at many of the situations that have happened to me, and close friends of mine, and if you were to flip the genders, people would be in jail. For example, I, not my friend have been physically tied down, and raped. I mean I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5‚Äù, 200 something pounds. I do not need to be physically scared of that. But things that have happened to me is mentally manipulated into sex among other things. Said ‚Äúno I don‚Äôt want that‚Äù for them to be like ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok it‚Äôs ok‚Äù, or a girl berating me to her friends that I wouldn‚Äôt fuck her, so I gave in to things out of guilt. Or after things fall off with that person, and I am perceived as the bad guy because I could not live up to her sexual needs, and lose many friends over it. This is happening to a close friend of mine, and he has failed to see it. Everyone laughs when he tells people ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna fuck her but she makes me‚Äù. It‚Äôs funny, because he‚Äôs a guy. But it‚Äôs not funny. It can fuck you up. For 5 years I could not even think of having sex, and now, I still have a bad relationship with sex because I fear that something bad will come of it; that I‚Äôll become a bad guy because of it, or like I am a villain when I don‚Äôt want to have sex (god bless my girlfriend for being great with this). But I am normally laughed at for this. It is not taken seriously. My friend, does not take me seriously, yet is miserable in his situation. He won‚Äôt get out of it, because he‚Äôs been manipulated to think it‚Äôs ok (he now even knows it‚Äôs not ok but doesn‚Äôt know what to do). 

And there is toxic masculinity. These issues come up, and I‚Äôve heard girls tell guys to ‚Äúman up and fuck me‚Äù. Or when a guy comes out with these sort of issues, they are laughed at because ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a guy, you liked it‚Äù. Or when a man‚Äôs mental health is in shambles and they are told to ‚Äútoughen up‚Äù everyday, until one day they kill themselves. In October 5 people. 5 peers of mine, ranging from kids I coach, to a second father though out childhood of mine took their own lives. In one month. They cried for help, but we didn‚Äôt hear them because ‚Äúthey will tough it out‚Äù. I watched a man drink himself away, depressed, drunken and dying. Everyone saw he needed help, but no one helped him. He died in October too. What I want, is not to abolish women‚Äôs rights, I think they are meaningful. What I want is to be treated the same, and the mental (and physical) wellbeing of men to be treated the same as our female or non-binary peers. I know what the stats say. I know these sexual abuse cases are less common. But they do happen, and but they are not treated the same. 

We can be hurt too. We can be mentally hurt and scarred, but no one likes to recognize that.",1,0

Men can't say no? [YouTube: Mediocre Tutorials and Reviews],"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70UAAaOmKfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70UAAaOmKfY)

""My body my cho... oh, I forgot, I got a dick. I'm *supposed* to be the horny, perverted sex.""

I've been trying to make a list of all the things that a man could say no for, and it oddly fluctuates, though some are obvious:

* Not attracted
* Don't feel like it
* May be too good to be true
* In a relationship
* Faithful to a religion
* Scared of STDs
* Don't want kids or get trapped
* Masculinity or pride

Notice how some of these women seem to have been stuck in ""female empowerment"" echo chambers where they are taught they are *automatically* the most entitled of anything. Especially the aggressive ""yellow"" haired woman. Women want equality, but still reap the exclusive double standard benefits of being a woman, which are stronger than whatever privileges we are supposed to have, whatever they are.

I could lose my brother,"Hi guys, im in tears writing this as I just learned that my brothers ex has put an AVO out on him with the accusation that he stalked her, drove past her house and followed her in his car. My brother cut communications with this girl and even being near her causes him to hyperventilate badly and eventually have an asthma attack. No evidence has been presented of this happening as his ex's house has security cameras.   


My biggest worry is that if she wins and the AVO is out then she can say at any time that hes near her and the cops will pick him up and he goes to jail for 2 years plus a $5.500 fine no questions asked. Our town is extremely small which means he could be seeing our cousin while shes at Mcdonalds and he gets picked up because of the 100m radius on the AVO.  


This is my cry for help, I just wanan know what I can do as a 14 year old teen or atleast can someone give me some coping mechanisms so I'm not in tears everytime I hear this.",0,0

"Wikipedia labeling a football (soccer) player as ""sexual harasser""","So out of curiosity I decided to check the Wikipedia page of a football (soccer) player who plays for a club in my country (I saw the result of a match played recently).  
And while I was looking at his personal life where I saw a sentence that made me angry and dissappointed  
Quote:  He is the son of former international basketball player and inductee of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2019 Mohsen Medhat Warda. And he is a sexual harasser"". 

He is accused of sexual harassement from a woman who claims that he harassed her sexually via Snapchat. They never met in person (if they did she does not mention it at all) and the only communication was via Snapchat messages (everything according to her claims). 

If he did harass her let the court decide if he is guilty or not (she said she will show the messages to the authorities). 

It is just sad for men to be judged like that. You are accused of sexual harrasment and everyone is pointing a finger at you. You are guilty before the case even reaches the court. Œóe faced similar accusations in the past which resulted him being dropped from his national team pickings but later returned due to lack of evidence. Unfortunatelly for him when the manager changed, he did not participate again. It can cause a lot of damage in a player's career because he can easily be dropped from being a key player to being sat on the sidelines until this is over. Not just for his national team but for whatever club he plays for

I posted a link to the article so everyone can have a look. It is in Greek though (Could not find anything in English)  but the description basically says what I wrote here. It states her claims and that now a lot of women contacted her to say that he harrassed them as well. You can take a look at the images which contain her messages and her claims (these are in English).",0,0

Gender Differences in Suicide Prevention Responses: Implications for Adolescents Based on an Illustrative Review of the Literature," [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4377906/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4377906/)

This review considered a broad array of published and peer-reviewed research that evidenced gender differences in the effectiveness of suicide prevention efforts. Twenty-two studies evaluate common universal prevention programs as well as targeted programs were used.¬†

The main type of programs that are analyzed are: school-based prevention programs, community-based prevention programs and health-based prevention programs.

The results of this review point to the priority for tailoring prevention programs so that adolescents, a high-risk group for suicidal behavior, can maximally benefit. Currently, females appear to be the primary beneficiaries of several prevention efforts, while males more often exhibit deleterious effects from exposure to programming. Concerted effort is needed to promote strategies that will also benefit males. A fruitful direction may be to separately implement and administer programming to males and females. For hard-to-reach males, preference-based programming allows an element of independence.",0,0

Circumcision shouldn‚Äôt be allowed for consenting adults either.,"I always hear talk about how circumcision shouldn‚Äôt be allowed until 18 (or whatever the adult age is). However, allowing it at 18 is wrong for the following reasons:

1. If I went to a hospital and asked them to chop off my finger, they would refuse, and rightfully so. If a person wants a healthy part of them removed, they must be grossly misinformed into thinking that‚Äôs a good thing.

2. If (in western countries, presumably) an adult woman went to the hospital and asked for FGM, she‚Äôd likely be refused. Rightfully so. Why should MGM be any different?

3. Stemming from the first two points, there will be so much propaganda thrown to intact children to pressure them into making a horrible choice the moment they turn legal. Propaganda from adamant cut people who could no longer mutilate children at birth, propaganda from the for-profit medical industry that still wants its revenue...how much is a choice a choice at 18 if you‚Äôve been miseducated and brainwashed into making that choice? To me it‚Äôs not unlike the college and predatory loan situation in the US.

Surrogacy as a single man,"What's up men! Even though my mind is made up to remain single in order not to fall victim to marital laws, I'm certain I want to be a father.

If you're wondering why it's so cheap, I'm from a developing country and 10k is a whole lot of money over there. 

The problem I have now is that I feel a bit awkward for considering this option. I'm the first child(and only son) in my family as well as the first grandchild from my mother's family and ideally everyone would love to see me in a huge wedding paid for by family followed by a big ceremony for the birth of my first child. I know these ideas may seem weird to people in the West but it's tradition where I'm from. I guess what I'm asking of you men is to help me feel less awkward about going against my tradition and disappointing my family. Of course, I'll be an object of gossip amongst people in my community if I finally choose this path. I'm a Stoic and I can deal with all these but I would still like to hear words of wisdom from men here about why such an unconventional decision by me isn't awful just because it's not the norm and how I can remain fulfilled if I make this choice",0,0

Study: The Gender Gap in Sex Offender Punishment," 

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333518551\_The\_Gender\_Gap\_in\_Sex\_Offender\_Punishment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333518551_The_Gender_Gap_in_Sex_Offender_Punishment)  
When matched for age, race, prior offending, type and severity of offending, the study finds that:  
\-A substantially larger percentage of males receive prison than do females (47% compared to 33%, respectively)  
\-A substantially larger percentage of females receive probation than do males (42% compared to 34%, respectively)  
\-Male sex oÔ¨Äenders receive longer sentences than female sex oÔ¨Äenders. Males on aver-age receive prison sentences that are more than 20ÓÄû months longer than those assigned to females (102.9 compared to 81.4), intensive probation sentences that are on average 1.5 months longer (20 compared to 18.5), and probation sentence lengths that are on aver-age 5 months longer (62.7 compared to 57.).  
Male sex oÔ¨Äenders, all else equal, are perceived to be more dangerous and culpable than their female counterparts and so experience more punitive and incapacitating sanctions.  
But the study is too female empathic. Its conclusion try to find excuse for judge:¬†  
""these Ô¨Åndings do not support advocating for policies that ‚Äúeven the score‚Äù by becoming more punitive for females""  
And they go on on how maybe male offenders are really more dangerous, that male cannot be treated without prison or that women cannot be treated in prison (like all the feminist bullshits saying that prisons is not for women). They say all that without any proof. Instead of being concerned that female abusers are given a free pass, are in liberty while potentially dangerous and are not punished for their action, they prefer to protect female sex offenders. What is funny is that they were wondering about if they were going to find that women would be punished harsher. I wonder if their reacrion would have been: ""do not punish women lighter"" or ""policy should be immediately implemented to be faire toward women !"" ?¬†",0,0

Participants ( N= 423; 276 women and 147 men) read a vignette depicting either a couple having consensual sex (control), or a male or female aggressor who initiates sexual intercourse via verbal coercion, use of alcohol, or physical abuse. College students were provided with legal instructions of sexual assault then asked to pro-vide a verdict, degree of guilt, and legal components.

Ratings of guilt were lower when the aggressor was female compared to male. In addition, male victims were more likely to be perceived as providing consent and less likely to experience fear of bodily injury when the aggressor was female.


Male were aslo less likely to put the blame on male victims but I believe that they found that result because men and boys only learn that they are potential rapists, not potential victims.",0,0

Males offenders receive substantially longer sentences. These disparities are primarily generated by departures from the guidelines, rather than differential sentencing within the guidelines. Departures produce about 70 percent of the male-female difference. Meaning that it was not because of the context that this disparity exists (as feminists want us to believe) but because judges get out of their way to help women. Males are also less likely to get no prison term when that option is available; less likely to receive downward departures ; and more likely to receive upward adjustments and, conditioned on having a downward departure, receive smaller reductions than females.

downward departures: judges giving lesss than the minimum sentence

upward adjustments: Higher sentence than what is asked",0,0
"Study: The Determinants of Punishment: Deterrence, Incapacitation and Vengeance (drivers who kill women get 56 percent longer sentences)"," 

[https://www.nber.org/papers/w7676](https://www.nber.org/papers/w7676)

About murders:

""Male offenders receive a 6.2 year longer sentence than female offenders if the victim is female and a 6.9 year longer sentence if the victim is male. Killing a woman also results in a substantially longer sentence. For male offenders, killing a woman increases the sentence length by 4.2 years. For female offenders, killing a woman results in a 4.9 year longer sentence.""

Therefore if you are a male murderer, you are punished harder. Whatever you sex, if you murder a woman, you are punished harder.

About drivers who kill someone:

""In the Bureau of Justice Statistics data, the gap for male offenders between male victims and female victims is 5.1 years""

"Asking for Advice: Men over the age of thirty who experienced sexual violence or assault as a child, what are some things your partner can do to help?","So I wanted to ask after the experiences of men who sought help due to the experience of sexual assault or violence in their childhood. My (24f) boyfriend (38m) is a survivor of childhood sexual assault but he doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable talking about it, I only know that it happened when he was very young and it was his older brother who assaulted him. I don‚Äôt know where, exactly when or what happened and I‚Äôve never told anyone else. 

He very casually references his trauma in conversation as if it‚Äôs no big deal, an indicator I recognise as one of severe and unresolved childhood trauma. He says quite shocking things in passing like it‚Äôs all good and it‚Äôs nothing to worry about, but when I ask if he wants to explain more or discuss it with me further he instantly withdraws and goes quiet. 

I immediately believed him of course, and never questioned the validity of his experience. I‚Äôm always gentle and don‚Äôt try to prove him for answers. 

It‚Äôs not my right to know since it‚Äôs his story and I completely respect that. He told me the first time I asked that ‚Äúyou wouldn‚Äôt want to know what happened to me.‚Äù So I gently told him that it‚Äôs not about ‚Äúwanting‚Äù because nobody wants to know that kind of thing and how it happened to a child, but it‚Äôs about need, since I‚Äôm his partner and I love him I feel it‚Äôs important that he tell me things like that. But I‚Äôm not pushing, like I said, it‚Äôs his story and I followed up by telling him that it‚Äôs his life and when he decides I need to know is entirely up to him. I reassured him that it‚Äôs 100% ok if he decides that I never need to know. 

But I feel like this has impacted him heavily for a long time. He was in an abusive relationship for about 15 years and I suspect that his ex wife either didn‚Äôt believe him, belittled him for his assault, or he never told her. As a result, he constantly deals with thoughts of depression and struggled at the beginning of our relationship accepting simple acts of care and consideration. He never puts himself or his own desires first, in almost every regard. He works himself to the bone and almost never allows himself any free time. He often puts himself down, calls himself ugly and fat and overweight despite looking like a normal man his age and height. He feels he doesn‚Äôt deserve good things and has told me that‚Äôs how he feels about himself. 

So men who experienced the same thing and deal with similar feelings: what can a partner do to help?",0,0

why are femisnsts ( and most women who identify as feminsts ) so self centered and think women only deal with problems ?,"an example is  how women think that only the women in the middle east are oppressed which isn't true 

i have 2 middle eastern male friends they were SEVERLY physically abused like using electricity to shock them or using heated metal ( which is common in some places like Egypt ) and one of them LITERALLY  lost his spleen because of getting beaten  meanwhile female get only screamed at ( they are physically abused sometimes too but not as bad a men )

males are expected to go into good colleges and work extremely hard jobs ( as young as 10 ) meanwhile females stay at home which is bad but not as bad

female circumcision in the middle east is illegal male circumcision is legal and expected

also how they complain about beauty standards yet they fate men above 6ft only, they complain about domestic violence  1in4 men are victims of domestic violence and 1in3 women but 96% of perpetrators are males which proofs that women get away easily without any punishment, they complain about rape and when men complain about false accusations they are met with hate even tho the proven actual rape cases are 1.5% and the proven false allegations cases are 8-10%

Greatest Feminist Myth: Feminism is about equality of BOTH genders.," 

When you **google** feminism, this is what comes up :

&gt;Feminism¬†is a range of¬†social movements,¬†political movements, and¬†ideologies¬†that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and **social¬†equality of the sexes.**

This seems to imply that feminism implies **gender equality.**

OPEN THAT ARTICLE FOR FUCKS SAKE AND READ IT.

&gt;Feminism¬†is a range of¬†social movements,¬†political movements, and¬†ideologies¬†that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social¬†equality of the sexes.\[a\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]¬†Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the **male** point of view, and that **women** are treated unjustly within those societies**.**\[6\]¬†Efforts to change that include fighting against¬†gender stereotypes¬†and establishing educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and **outcomes for women that are equal to those for men.**

Feminism ASSUMES that women are below men and by bringing them up or equal to men they are achieving gender equality. **It is NOT PRIMARILY about helping BOTH sexes.** **It's GYNOCENTRIC.**

Why is Australia so pro-women without regard to equality?,"If any country refuses to acknowledge facts, it's Australia, India too.

The blind resume initiative is what led me to believe this. 

They wanted more diversity so they thought to remove names from resumes. They though managers were discriminating based on names therefore against women.

When names were removed, women were at a disadvantage. When names were added, they had more call backs...

So they said scratch this initiative which seemed very fair. We don't want to disadvantage women.

"""Locker room talk""... FOR WOMEN","***Let's hear some stories***

When the topic of ""locker room talk"" pops up, I'm sure you've heard a Feminist link that directly to ""toxic masculinity""---that BS Woke concept that implies certain behavioral traits are restricted exclusively to just one sex.

The truth is many men have heard the female equivalent of ""locker room talk."" That's what we're hear to talk about. For instance, how many of you have heard female coworkers talk about the following or similar to:

* all the things they‚Äôve *shared* \*cough\* on OnlyFans (plus all the money they make) and the people they‚Äôve engaged with and which ones they find attractive
* the women who share how they swoon over men in uniforms and how they just want to rip into them (can you imagine the reaction if a guy just announced he would walk up to a woman and rip her top off?)
* Which celebrities or coworkers they want to wrap their legs around
* the female managers who openly share what type of lube they think works best because it doesn't burn their vaginas (seriously, not only did she talk about that stuff with her coworkers, she's the type that acts all offended and ""professional"" if *you talk about sex* cuz that's a No-No)
* or the women who love to socialize with gay men in similar lewd conversations *in your presence* because, by their own admission, they feel safe to talk all they want about dicks with guys present

Yes, I've heard this type of chatter before in the workplace, and I'm sure many of you out there have heard all kinds of things.... ***so let's hear them. Share your best one(s), don't care how many you want to talk about.***

I know men can talk about boobs all day and say a bunch of things in locker rooms, I would just prefer if we stop pretending that one sex does this stuff just to justify their Woke beliefs that ""toxic masculinity"" is a real thing. So let's hear all the types of naughty things women talk about, often to casually and nonchalant at work, the office, or in the classroom -- the kind of things that would invite a hailstorm of Feminist stigmitizations if it was men talking about these things about women.",39,0

Having an argument in r/MensRights and suddenly a wild moron appears.,"Having a civil discussion on a post regarding consent laws. I stated that my opinion was that minors should be responsible for properly disclosing their age in order for a claim of statutory rape to be valid.

After a civil conversation with a couple of other members of the sub one person in particular seemed quite disagreeable and closed minded. u/anahawkinss disagreed with my statement quite passionately.

From askfeminists FAQ,"Why don't feminists care more about men's issues?

Feminism has mixed feelings about directly addressing men‚Äôs problems. Many feminists fear that addressing men‚Äôs issues, or ‚Äúgender issues‚Äù as a broad goal, will move the conversation completely away from women‚Äôs issues (remember, we live in a male-dominated society still). So instead they focus on women‚Äôs issues, and allow others to focus on their issues. Many feminists would like to see pro-feminist men tackle men‚Äôs issues in a way that doesn‚Äôt blame women and feminism for all their problems (see MRAs). Many feminists¬†do¬†care about men's issues, but demanding that feminists dedicate exactly 50% of their time and resources to such things is unreasonable. Please check out



As I've said, feminism isn't about equality for all, it's about equality when women have a disadvantage.

protecting a man with a security system,"I won't name any names in this, for obvious reasons.  Some years back, it was my job to help a man get his security system up and running, including cameras.  What was going on was he was recently divorced and had visitation rights with his 13 year-old daughter.  However, his vindictive and hateful ex wife was trying to destroy his visitation rights, and his relationship with his daughter altogether.

For those of you not familiar with security cameras, let me explain.  There are two basic approaches to making recordings.  1. You could have cameras that use motion detection to choose whether to record.  No motion = no recording, but if someone walks in front of the camera, it triggers motion and you thus get a clip that gets placed on the cloud.  The idea is to only record what's relevant.  There is no continuous recording.  2. Continuous recording to an SVR.  As the name suggests, this type of system records continuously and keeps the video saved to a hard drive on an SVR, a device similar to the DVR that you use to record TV.

So my job was to get this gentleman's cameras converted over from the motion-based recording system to a continuous SVR-based one.  His reason for wanting the change was simple.  His ex wife was falsely accusing him of molesting their 13 year-old daughter.  He felt the need to have positive proof that he was doing no such thing.  I knew for a fact he wasn't.  If he were doing that, the continuous video would prove that he was.  But he wanted the video system just to get the courts to believe him.  So much for innocent until proven guilty.  Of course, there are some rooms where you typically would not want to have cameras recording, such as the bathroom and the bedroom.  So his plan was to keep the door to the bedroom locked so that she could not go in there even if she wanted to.  Then if she went to the bathroom, he would stay in view of one of the cameras.

I felt bad for the guy, but I was glad to help him defend himself.  I also made sure to state that I'm not a lawyer, but rather a security specialist.  I could help him set up his system and learn how to use it, but I also strongly recommended that he speak with his lawyer to make sure that his strategies were sound.

I never did find out what happened with this gentleman.  Once my job of getting his system up and running was over, I was no longer in touch with him.  The security dealer was then taking over the monitoring of his system.

However, there is one thing I've noticed.  When I relay this story to let feminists know that, yes, false accusations are a real thing that sometimes can happen, they act hostile.  I've been accused of being a ""rape apologist"" for trying to help an innocent man defend himself.  I can only imagine the vitriol his lawyer must get.  The ""believe all women"" slogan is nonsense.  There is no group of people on this Earth that never lies and is never mistaken.  And just because I helped one man to protect himself does not mean I have any sympathy for actual rapists.

Another job I had was to set up an SVR and cameras for a high school teacher to use in his classroom, especially for when he did one-on-one consultations with his students.  He was an unmarried man like me, and was often met with unwarranted suspicion.  With cameras constantly rolling, he had the ability to prove his innocence if he needed to.  Those SVRs don't have unlimited space, btw.  They usually have a 1, 2, or 4 terabyte hard drive.  Depending on the resolution and the number of cameras hooked up to it, it will typically have something like 30 or 60 days worth of footage.  So I had to help the teacher set up a backup system as well, a RAID device that could hold a massive amount of data.  That way he could be protected if someone accused him of molesting them 2 years ago or something.  But even then, there was still the possible danger of footage getting destroyed in a disaster such as a fire or a flood.

What's very disturbing is the number of times I've had conversations with feminists about the importance of due process, and the fact that false accusations are real.  Most of the time, the feminist has shown no concern for the protection of innocent men.  It's baffling to me how some people will take my view that ""you need to protect the innocent from false accusations"" to mean ""I'm fine with women getting raped.""  I don't see any logical correlation to that.

Camera systems can help innocent men, but they have their limitations.  If their footage is lost, they can't protect you.  If the power goes out and any backup power runs out, they stop recording.  They also only protect in specific areas.  That man could only see his 13 year-old daughter in his own home where he knew he was protected.  So much for taking a father/daughter trip to a park or an amusement park or God forbid a road trip.

This is just a small sample of people I've helped with security systems.  This is getting long.  But suffice it to say, I've needed to help men in many more situations than the ones described here.  In my own life, I've also experienced people automatically assuming I'm some kind of predator.  People flipped out when I went to a national park with a DSLR camera and a long lens.  I was there to photograph birds, but people assumed I was some kind of perv who wanted pictures of their kids.

I'd doubt I'm the only one with stories like this.  These stories are real.  And I've got a bunch more.

TL;DR: I needed to protect a man from false rape accusations by using continuous feed security cameras.  ",15,0
I just wanted to share the opening post by the moderator of a new subreddit called r/TheManClan. I stumbled upon it by accident through a post on another sub. I figured there could be a lot of men on here that would love the idea of this sub as much as I do!,"As a member of the millennial generation, there are certain skills that we missed out on. This isn‚Äôt shameful, it‚Äôs a fact of life. Many of us have never cooked a steak, BBQ‚Äôd or changed our oil. Also, men don‚Äôt have the same support structure, are more likely to commit suicide, and are made to feel that help, therapy and support isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmanly‚Äù. This is a place for all of those things.

This is a place of positive support and a safe place for men to share their opinions, their fears, ask for help and ask for support. Any malice, verbal abuse or significant negativity toward other users or attempts to ‚Äústir the pot‚Äù will result in a ban.

Secondly, this is a free for all for ideas. You can post opinions and topics that relate to things that will or could improve someone‚Äôs life. These can include life advice, skill building, educational and thoughtful information, wholesome and positive memes, and challenges or topics of basic skills we should all have learned. For example, a challenge could be to cook a steak or change your cars oil. Simple things, easily acknowledged and things we should be able to do but might not be able to because of our generation.

Although this is the Man Clan and a space for positive support and building friendships, we will welcome women in need as well.

The patriarchy myth,"The patriarchy. We‚Äôve all heard of it. It‚Äôs a mystical society run by men which benefits men. The patriarchy that lets men be the largest majority of men living on the streets

This patriarchy is also responsible for the oppression of women for years according to feminism, however feminism fail to see that now, in the modern era, they are the majority.
This is why we see things like ‚Äòmanspreading‚Äô, ‚Äòmansplaining‚Äô etc. Women in the west are no longer oppressed, and so they seek oppression in an era in which, oppression is enviable.
Boys are taught from day one that they are dirty and disgusting, while girls are clean and immaculate in every way. Why do we ‚Äòempower‚Äô our daughters in exchange for the self confidence of our sons?

My Law class is sexist.,"I'm not one to preach the term 'sexist' easily. I understand the extreme nature of the term so I don't use it lightly. With that being said, I am currently attending Sixth Form in England (ages 16 to 18), and Law is one of my chosen subjects. My class has 3 boys including myself, and about 25 girls. I didn't mind this at first, okay, my radar for making friends is very slim, but maybe I can get along well with the girls or at least just get my head down and enjoy the course.

The teacher is female, important thing to note. Relatively young for a teacher, so she spends a lot of time each lesson talking to the girls about some recent album that's came out, or some inconvenience they have with putting some make-up on (this is not a generalised stereo-type based comment, they talk about this a lot) and everything else. Okay, I feel slightly neglected in the sense that I can't join in on these conversations, but if I had a male teacher who liked the same things I did, then I wouldn't hesitate to talk to him about football all lesson.

But when the actual class gets going, minor instances build up to me just feeling uncomfortable... The 'casual conversation' I mentioned between the teacher and students normally goes to talk about how lazy and irritating men can be sometimes, and how they would enforce a curfew if they could for men, and then at what times the curfew would start and they just start discussing a male-free utopia. Then they start talking about privilege.

All of this is amplified by the fact that often, in Law A-Level, the teacher will make up a story to help us understand a legal concept, so we need to apply the legal concept to the context of the story and see who is liable and all of that, in these stories, the victim will often be the female and nearly all of the time it is the Male that has been negligent of their child or abused their wife or mistreated female colleagues. It's never a woman committing the crime.

In addition, if the teacher is mentioning an actual case, she'll mention how some man killed his wife, and then a girl in the class will say something along the lines of ""That's shitty"" and then someone else will say ""Men are trash in general"" and all of these case examples and stories just feed into the narrative of the casual conversation and it creates a very toxic classroom environment. Finally, the teacher tends to commend the female students more, she'll never tell a girl that they straight up got the question wrong but she's very blunt to me whenever I get a question wrong. I'm not using this as my main point as this could be a coincidence but I'm just pointing it out.

I think this is the result of the teacher being slightly sexist and the ongoing 'men are trash' narrative that is trendy to preach if you are a teenager. A Law class of 95 percent girls gives the girls a perfect time to put men in a bad light and not reap consequences. I'm a 16 year old student and I just feel uncomfortable in my Law class. Thanks for listening, thought I'd provide some insight on classroom environment nowadays.",107,0

Today is an historic first for the office of Vice President of the United States,"You may have seen the journalists raving today about the historic nature of Kamala Harris being sworn in as Vice President of the United States.  These journalists are right, but for the wrong reasons.

The journalists are gushing about Kamala Harris being the first woman to become Vice President, but that is not actually her achievement.  She didn't earn that one.  Her actual achievement is being the first Vice President to be handed the job via affirmative action.  Instead of explaining the exact details myself, I will refer you to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/jt7bod/the_vice_presidency_is_being_handed_to_kamala/) post by a well-informed Redditor who explains the issue much better than I could.

So in short, we should celebrate Kamala Harris not as America's first female Vice President, but rather as the first affirmative action Vice President of the United States.  Always remember that she was handed the job for checking all the right boxes in a way that no other contender was able to do by the ""merit"" of the genetics she inherited by being born.  That is quite an achievement like no other.

Well done, Kamala.  Well done.",22,0

"There is a strong clinical need for discrete mental health and suicide prevention services for men and boys, without the feminist bias of current failing services","Back in 2019 SBS Australia and the Australian Men‚Äôs Health Forum (AMHF) reported that the proportions of boys contacting the Australian government and charity funded Kids Helpline had plummeted from 35% of callers to 21% of callers since 2008. This massive failure to engage with boys by the key children‚Äôs counselling service was otherwise met with indifference in the mainstream of child mental health service provision and suicide prevention culture. 
https://www.sbs.com.au/news/coronavirus-worries-have-australian-children-calling-kids-helpline-every-69-seconds
https://www.amhf.org.au/kids_helpline_reaching_fewer_boys

Kids Helpline has acknowledged this loss of engagement with boys, but appears to be taking a feminist ideological approach of ‚Äúboy blaming‚Äù when looking for solutions. The Australian Human Rights Commission in conjunction with Kids Helpline, has recently produced a report analysing issues of concern kids have raised in counselling sessions during COVID-¬¨19, which shows kids have experienced serious impacts on their mental health, social connections and education. But the analysis is fundamentally flawed as the respondents were predominantly female (&gt;75%), and only include a very small proportion of non-LGBTI boys.
https://kiddipedia.com.au/children-experiencing-serious-impacts-during-pandemic/

Kids Helpline conducted a survey of kids using the service and parents, including questions on how to encourage more boys to use the service. However, the questions asked show an entrenched culture of misandry and victim blaming, by focusing poor service use on issue related to masculinity, rather than service provision. 

Q2- How can we engage young boys to have open conversations about their feelings?

Q3- Do you think this is part of a larger conversation about breaking down barriers of gender stereo-types to allow boys to understand it‚Äôs ok to be vulnerable &amp; to give them permission to talk about their feelings.?

Q4-Do you think we need to provide more guidance to boys to give them the tools and language to articulate their feelings?

Completely missing from the analysis is any acknowledgement that the service is run by almost entirely by women, both in terms of management and counselling staff, many of who have radical feminist beliefs with histories of public speaking and publications focused almost entirely on the welfare of women and girls. 

This shallow misandrist approach of blaming male stereotypes is entirely sourced from a feminist ideological framing of masculinity (the strawman stereotype), and reveals a service culture at best unsuitable, and at worst, openly hostile to men and boys. The continuing failure of Kids Helpline to engage with boys, and similar problems related to services provided to men and boys by feminist dominated organisations, suggests a high clinical need for discrete services for men and boys, provided by professionals appropriately trained to deliver services without feminist bias and stereotypes, and without male-blaming. 

Unfortunately, it is unlikely that these kinds of effective specialised services will ever be provided given the current gender bias of the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Sex Discrimination Commission, and Kids Helpline. All of these important public services entrusted to provide and oversee the equitable delivery of services to the most vulnerable in our community, are dominated by women with little or no interest in the welfare of men and boys, women entrenched in a culture of feminist stereotypes and misandry.",18,0

incest,"I was on a therapy website where random people can privately listen to struggles. I was texting a lady there about my sexual struggles when she asked to discuss my sexual thoughts. I vaguely described them and kept the conversation towards ""sex is dangerous for me because of STIs, false accusations, honey traps, criminal prostitution, and etc."" But she kept belittling the dangers and she asked again to describe the thoughts.

Usually I'd describe the thoughts, but they were sexual. Sexual communications are a bannable offense. I've been suspended a lot from that website for sexting. I felt very insecure about describing my thoughts and didn't really want to. So instead, I asked if she ever had sexual thoughts and how those thoughts were.

She just vaguely described the thoughts with ""Great thoughts"" or some similar phrase. Since she answered so vaguely, I replied ""I think you are lying."" So she texted ""I had great sex with my stepson last night,"" or some similar phrase. I immediately blocked her.

Any other man might've asked her to go into details or may have fantasized about that, but I didn't. I remembered a lot of posts on r/mensrights about women who sexually abuse boys and men. 

How would a woman feel if she were talking with a man who said ""I had great sex with my step daughter last night?"" That man would probably be reported to the police for child sexual abuse. Men already face stereotypical allegations of pedophilia, to the extent where some orphanages might reject foster applicants simply due to gender. I've been on a babysitting website where nearly 90% of babysitters were women and where my babysitting account was deleted and refunded without explanation.

Some people might assume the step son is an adult who tempted his step mom. But let's be real: the step mom could've complained about the step son's sexual advances to his father or the orphanage. And then why would the step mom be referencing such incest as a great sexual experience? She has the parental authority alone to thwart off her step son's sexual advances, and to even return him to the orphanage under sexual criminal or civil charges. And why would any step son risk losing a parent or supporter for sex?

Her incest can easily involve into an envious fight between the son and the father. Even without the father, the step mom legally has more power than her step son. She can probably kick him out for a night if he stares at another woman. Incest is horrible and that step son is in a lot of crap now. 

On that therapy website, random women tend to block me whenever I describe my sexual thoughts upon request, but today I ended up blocking a woman instead. The reversal is all very interesting. From now on, whenever I'm having a conversation with another women there, I should ask her about her thoughts before disclosing my thoughts. I don't want to be perverted there by women who practice incest.",5,0

Has anyone else found misandry in academics?,"one major advantage I have over 95% of people my age (16m) is my intelligence, most kids my age can‚Äôt define the word quanta (an elementary particle related to one of the four forces of nature electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak forces IE: the electron is the quanta of electromagnetism) ffs most kids my age don‚Äôt even have a basic scientific understanding outside of the little science we‚Äôre taught in school.

Yet I‚Äôve been put down in academics almost my entire life even in science classes of which I already knew most of the shit they taught in those classes years before taking them. It always seemed no matter how much effort I put in my grade would either be the same or worse, almost like someone was just saying ‚Äúnah fuck you your grade is a 67‚Äù.

Before we went virtual for this god awful pandemic I usually got really good grades on tests (80s-90s) except for classes on subjects I wasnt very enriched in and just couldn‚Äôt concentrate in like English (70s-80s) but now that they don‚Äôt have to return the test and show us what we did wrong my test grades have been around the 50-70 range.

Nothing changed the tests aren‚Äôt very hard at all (tbh it‚Äôs even easier now that I can Google shit that I forget) but now that tests aren‚Äôt being sent back to show me what I did wrong my grades even on subjects I‚Äôm very good at and very interested in (which means I actively try to learn more about these subjects outside of school and often ponder about them) like math and science classes are slipping?

Coincidence? Definitely not, like I said the subject material is not hard at all the only real thing holding me back is my poor memory and ADHD (which fucks my concentration beyond belief but only when I‚Äôm totally uninterested otherwise I‚Äôm fine)

A rant about #notallmen,"I want to preface this by saying that while I am not a self identified feminist, I do agree with and support the core values of feminism in principle. What I don't agree with is the whole #notallmen mockery. The sarcastic, eye rolling, straw man style of argument is a complete double standard. ""Women are materialistic"" = sexist hate speech. Meanwhile, ""Men (the same gigantic generalization) actively try to suppress and control women"" = finally someone had the courage to say it. Then the arguments start and the easiest way to dismiss the opposition is the #notallmen defence. The unspoken, assumed, unwritten rule that all women have the right to bad mouth ""men"" as a general term because they only refer to the many bad guys out there in the world. Anyone who gets offended by the generalization has CLEARLY missed the point. They weren't talking about you. In fact, they take it a step further. Not only is your complaint about their generalization pointless, but it is its own kind of attack on them. They already have so many moleters, harrassers, attackers, and such to worry about. Now, they have to worry about you! A typical man who doesn't get the joke and feels offended. It's no wonder that these feminist women have no patience for comments or criticisms about their choice of words or style of speech. They already feel ignored, exploited, and harmed by social norms and men most of all. As a husband who works a full time job in China, washes/hangs the laundry, cooks regularly, does the dishes, vacuums and mops the floor, takes out the garbage, feeds the cats and cleans their litter everyday, blah, blah, blah, on and on, THE POINT IS the #notallmen sarcasm relies on constant  antagonism, insults, and shame.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome? 

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.",244,0

The Deafening Silence of Reasonable Women,"Hi all, 

Back in August, I was having some drinks one evening in the bar patio with a couple of dozen younger friends, and was pulled up by a 20-something friend - who otherwise considers himself a Conservative, despite hailing from a very leftist area - and his female friend, about a t-shirt I had on, depicting nubile women, shall we say, approaching states of undress.  

You guessed it - I got the usual patter about ""Objectifying"", ""Sex objects"" etc.  

I replied, ""Guys - it's Saturday night.  This is a public house (bar).  You have to be 18 and over to be drinking here, so we're all grownups and can handle a little skin, especially as there's no genitalia or nipples depicted.""  My friend launched into a diatribe about women's ""feelings""...you can guess I steered the convo onto other matters pretty quick. 

Now, in summer, I wear such t-shirts precisely because so few people do, because there are so few left available in the shops.  Because our rights to do what we men do are under ceaseless attack.  This is my way of flying the flag, or rather, wearing it.  And I've been doing so a decade, now.  

This was the 2nd, maybe third young woman in that time who has expressed distaste.  One bi girl expressed lust over a particularly attractive girl displayed, and we had a chuckle, TOGETHER - two very different people - about taking it in turns with the girl.  Share and share alike.... :) But I digress. 

The point is this....where is the reasonable, yet outspoken, contingent of women?  It's often said that the heaviest brains are the quietest.  The ones who would give a lucid, cogent insight into the way they view my t shirts.  Or view anything.  

The ones who'd say, ""Look mate, we women don't want to be considered weak or neurotic, but the truth is yes, we ARE physically weaker, more prone to depression/neuroses etc, we don't play Chess, Darts, or drive F1 with even a tenth of the success of men or half of us suffer from body dysmorphia, some of us are feminists who are sore seeing so many naked women, and some of us are outright jealous of these young fitties because we can't have such powerful attraction to men.  And of course you have a small minority of women, a tiny minority even, who don't suffer any of the aforementioned hangups, and think it's a healthy male libido that appreciates womanly curves, drum tight skin and thick, long, lustrous hair"".  

Yeah, a few of you guys are laughing right now - and a fewer still gnashing your teeth in anger - at the thought of a woman (n)ever uttering such deep, and frank truths.   Yet I'm CONVINCED such women exist, millions of them even, but in a collective state of fear, only daring to tell the truth to those lucky enough to be their husbands, sons, brothers and even rarer best male friends.  Their collective silence, I would submit to you, is WORSE than the feminists; the latter at least leave you in no doubt about their stupidity, but what about OUR right to have sense about women coming from all angles including from women?

(on a wider perspective, society's nasty habit of withholding the truths that are painful for everyone in the short term but beneficial to the recipient long term, whilst disguising it as ""Politeness"", is something I find deeply immoral - but sadly that's outside the scope of this sub)   

For a gender that prides itself on its communication skills, women are staggeringly poor at relaying exactly what bothers them.   I suspect that to do so, in this case, would first require them to self-analyze to an extremely uncomfortable degree, the ultimate conclusions exposing them to their hypocrisy - those being that despite their protestations of equality, they were never equal, and never going to be equal.  That lack of honesty, with us men in particular and with themselves in general, imo, is one of womanhood's greatest modern failures - perhaps its greatest.",9,0
What is Positive or Good Masculinity,"Okay before I start off, this question is semi rhetorical. I feel like I kind of know what good and positive masculinity is or at least what it should be. But it just seems like all the media and Feminist publications ever talk about is Toxic Masculinity and they never talk about Good Masculinity. They always insist that not all Masculinity is bad and yet they never tell us exactly what exactly it is in Masculinity that isn't bad. I'm sorry if this is coming off like a rant but I have honestly have just reached my limit on hearing the term ""Toxic Masculinity"" all over social media and even in the news. I really just want to hear good things about masculinity especially from feminists, the same people who say they don't hate men yet often say very hateful things about men. I know some feminists do come in here normally to troll or try to refute things so if there are any Feminists here reading this, here is your opportunity to talk positively about Masculinity and talk about the Good things about Masculinity and not the ""Toxic"" things.",29,0

"Gender pay gap is a claim to bring men down: If women are cheaper to employ, why don't businesses fire all men and hire women..."," Gender pay gap does not make sense: If women are cheaper to employ, why don't businesses fire all men and hire women? 

I can't understand feminist non-sense. Men and women must have equal access to employment, which they do. The fact that there is a pay gap does not mean anything. For example, women might have different priorities in life and less experience compared to men. Also, they choose different professions that pay less and are more likely to work part-time. Assuming that women get paid less than men within the same post/company, even though they have the same qualifications, experience and performance, then it could be said that women do not negotiate their salaries hard enough or prefer to apply to lower paying posts/adverts, because they perceive these positions as less competitive.

If there is a gap we must empower women to take more risks, instead of bringing down men and nurturing victim culture, conflict and hatred.",109,0

The things that made me want to join r/MensRights (Love you guys btw),"\*Warning: this could be upsetting or triggering, contains sexual abuse\*

&amp;#x200B;

I saw a story from a guy who was violently raped when he was young.

That already got me upset. But it gets worse.

When he decided to open up and get therapy, the therapist told him that he didn't believe him, and called child protective services on him because they assumed the man was abusing his wife and children. The guy divorced his wife because he was scared he would hurt them or something bad  would happen.

So basically, a therapist, a person meant to believe in and help people, looked at an emotionally unstable person who has been through serious trauma and reached out for help and thought:

This person is a man, he must be terrible.

Honestly, why???

The other thing that made me want to join was Johnny Depp's and Amber Heard's crazy ""Nobody will believe you because you're a man"" thing.

Then there's the overall radical feminist thing. Honestly the worst.

The last thing is, women are really privileged these days, and can be absolutely toxic.

Women also get compliments and such all the time.

Men's suicide rate and severe self-harm rate is much higher than women's; but they remain bashed by the internet and in general. When was the last time a man got a hug or a compliment without being attacked or called gay? Honestly, I feel really badly about the popularity of ""Women good, men bad"" stuff, and I want to say that I love my guys for being so strong despite all the hate they get and the bias against them.

"""Never get committed (marriage) &amp; Never provide to her ‚Äù Not MGTOW","Feminist have pushed Women not perform the feminine role and denounce responsibility to their actions. It's high time men denounce their roles too

In my point of view traditional masculine and feminine role served a purpose. To keep checks and balances for both men and women in the society.

Men provide and protect the house. Women provide kids and make the house into a liveable home. Both promised monogamy and care for each other in marriage.

Now this is being dismantled step by step &amp; promotes favouring only to women.

I am not suggesting mgtow, but some what similar. Sleep around don't commit to relationship, until your extremely sure. Consider this as your marriage. Don't buy her anything concrete(gifts, cars, house or money). If you spend on her make sure you are a part of it like a dinner, vacation trip. Don't sponsor spa &amp; make overs, that's her responsibility to keep her attractive to you. If she pushes for marriage, start searching for your new mate and break up when you find one. You will always find a better one. 

If you are like me and want a kid, hire a surrogate mother (cheaper than a car) to have your own kid or adopt.

strange request,"The other day, I was at the store when a young woman asked me to take her card out of the ATM. Allegedly her nails were preventing her to take the card out.

Now I'm a nice guy. Whenever any woman asks me to reach for something that's high on a shelf in a food store, I reach for it.

But I had to get a card, not food. And I had to get it from an ATM machine, not a shelf. So I said that I couldn't help with her card because I didn't want to infect her with COVID-19.

She wasn't disabled. She wasn't old. She was within reach of the card. She just had to use her fingers in a certain way to get it. Did she want to piggyback on me, to avoid touching the dirty floor too?

Any other man might've tried to be chivalrous and aid her, but I've been wary around young woman. I don't find much criminal reports about them, and a lot of the known reports seem to portray them as innocent. But I know women, like humans and animals, have the capacity to prey on others. A society that fails to report or publish such predation doesn't affect that predation's exist. If nobody told me about gravity, then that doesn't mean that I won't fall off a cliff.

marrying,"One way to stave off sexual predators is by having a wife.

But what if she has extramarital sex? Imagine living with a woman who contracts herpes or other new or random STIs from other men that can be passed onto me, even without my having sex with her. Living with her would shorten my lifespan rather than extend it, which the latter was the goal in avoiding sexual predators.

Why did she marry me if she's going to have extramarital sex? How can I make sure that I don't marry a sexual predator, especially when I barely have any connections with childhood female friends?

What if she wrongfully initiates divorce, using it as a tool to take resources from me? I've read of men who have been divorce-raped. Maybe I can read laws protecting me from such wrongful divorce but she can always fabricate evidence, documents, and witness. And I could lose children! My mom and dad divorced, and my mom took all three children. I can't imagine losing a child, even to a predator. Remarrying after divorce is believed to be near adultery, so I might not ever rightfully recover.

I could initiate a divorce in many situations, but I feel such divorce is shameful under Christianity. And again, remarrying is like near adultery. Outside of Christianity, my resources would likely be taken away too.

If I do decide to marry, for the sake of staving off sexual predators, then I'd need to be careful with whom I marry. I probably shouldn't rush marriage. I can probably find local marriage and divorce statistics to review the longevity of some marriages in my society.",3,0

Sister calls me a misogynist,"So basically, I had a normal talk with my sister about feminism and men. I disagreed that people can't say KAM and RAW. To sum up she said that it is misogynistic to not agree with KAW and RAW just because of the person's trauma. This is very hypocritical because she said that a women doesn't need trauma to say KAM and the opposite for a man. She got very emotional and very mad. She also compared me to my dad who is a real cultural misogynistic. I don't understand how people can just normalize hating on an entire gender. Wtfs wrong with her. There was much more we talked about like Men don't get killed because they are men. I said that it is not prevelant but it still happens. She said that it is not a problem. I asked her if she could go into depth of what she said and she straight up said that mens lives don't matter. I agree that men and women should be 50/50 with equal laws and no bias. I don't see how I made her batshit crazy by just stating my very normal opinion. She also said that women are much better than men just because she couldn't vote a 100 years ago. that's like saying black people are better than men just cuz they have a very bas history with white people. I support BLM but I don't agree that anyone is superior or inferior just because of their race, creed, ethnicity, skin colour, etc.",28,0

prostitution watch,"Prostitution is illegal here, but some local prostitutes still try to trick men into buying diseases and being robbed. Some local prostitutes get really desperate for resources too, and would stalk and prey on any man; just as a hungry animal would eat any prey when starving. Some prostitutes can even make use of a man's life, in the event that he has no resources to steal.

Before leaving home, I forgot to carry my defense against female predators and prostitutes. But since I was already out the door, I didn't bother to turn back to carry the defense. What's the worst that could happen?

While observing nature, I crossed by some woman who seemed pretty normal. But then I remembered that I was walking in an area far from the buildings, cars, and roads. It was in the area that I came across two people who appeared to be having sex and tried to communicate with me, so I became alert.

After a while, I looked back and she had turned around as if she were stalking me.

She was wearing bright colors, maybe to visually attract prey. She was wearing tight jeans that had rips showing black pants or leggings underneath. Why would anyone wear such revealing pants during the cold winter?

Maybe she was an ordinary woman. But when she passed by me again, quite soon after our first encounter, she didn't appear to have shoes. She was stepping on the mud with black socks, even stepping in a puddle. It was not a usual sight. Maybe she wasn't sober.

Maybe she needed help, but she should've asked me for help. She's an adult and has the capacity to seek help. I'm not falling for that ""women are innocent"" or ""women are easily frightened by men"" crap. Women are adults and need to act as such. And I'm not letting my guard down simply because of gender. A female bear can eat a man just as gruesomely as a male bear can.

I would not be surprised if she was a prostitute. Through the way she was dressed, her distance away from witnesses, and her proximity near me; her being a prostitute/predator was pretty obvious. There were also two men further up the park trail that she was walking up. I don't commonly see two men working out together at that area.

I'm happy that I kept my distance from her, though I really didn't like her proximity near me. It was an ugly and unpleasant sight. I really should've carried my defense, to keep her away. Well, I learned my lesson.",2,0

"I really hate it when someone says ""teach men not to *insert violent crime*"", ""toxic masculinity*, and any other buzzy words.","This post is a rant.

I don't mind if I'm a gay man, I'm just also one of the brothers that I'm fighting for!

It's really annoying when someone could pull out t34¬©H m3N n0T T0 *insert violent crime, ex: rape, pervert, etc.

The context in there is misandristic and it's flawed.
The phrase is often generally implied. The only subject in the context is ""men"".

Teach men not to *insert violent crime. Why though? Do men do that unless they are taught? Even that phrase makes seem the violent crime normalised at the first place.

The criminal be like ""jeez, am I doing bad even though I'm matured enough to understand and know what I'm doing? I have to stop though, thanks for reminding""

Blames the crime is only to men and erases female sexual abusers too.

-------

The mainstream's view regarding masculinity is extremely misleaded. As they see masculinity is only bad stuff like crime and boys can't cry.

And annoyingly, when some guy just did wrong by their personal situation, and that guy happened to be a man, people will blame, toxic masculinity, that it just generalizes men's nature that they do those stuff. I think it's a False Equivalence fallacy, comparing a male criminal, to a male who's just eating ramen at the afternoon with his son, and happened to be both men, assumed that they have the same nature.

The term ""toxic masculinity"" was only originated by the mythopoetic men's movement(1980s and 1990s), which is advocating for self-help and therapy for men. The term became widespread in 2010 when the popular writings, media, and the mainstream has been using the term to refer masculine norms.

You can't remove violence, rigorous ambition, and competence into the male psyche, and that doesn't mean it's bad. It's males' biological instincts, and forcing something to remove at its natural state doesn't do good, it will just cause inappropriation, annoyance, irritate, and ignorance.

The violence can be used to good to fight tyranny like the army, instead of unnecessarily hurt people.

The rigourous ambition that make guys do risky stuff can be harnessed to do heroic actions.

The competence and greed of males can be useful for building economies and sports, rather than cheating.

You can't make good men by making them less men.
You can't make good men, by taking the ""men"" away.
They become good if they stop doing the bad.

Masculinity is not toxic, it's just by how you use it.

Plus, the way people say 1t$ 4l$0 d0N3 B¬• m3N to for example, male to male crime, and especially when men are the majority that make the laws and so they therefore imply that it's not an issue even though there is unjust happening in males is just victim blaming.

What is the biggest problem facing father's today?,"I'm going to argue that it is the division of labour in the home, it is the fact that so many of us fathers feel not just the need to provide for our families, but the obligation that it is solely our duty to make sure the rent/mortgage is paid, that food is on the table and that our kids have access to the resources they need to make it into adulthood as a well balanced, healthy and productive adult themselves.

That should not be the case, the third wave of feminism we are in right now has rightfully championed for women's equality in the workplace, however that same movement actively works against mens equality in the home, while the traditional gender roles at work have been crashing down for 50 year's, the same has not happened for the traditional gender roles at home, both for legislation and societies expectations, and there is a good reason for this.

It is cheaper for our government.

Our government knows that men have been conditioned for hundreds or thousands of years to be the sole income earner in the home, and we do that because we want the best for our families, and that fact it used against us, one of the primary metrics used by the court for who get's primary custody is ""who has been the primary caregiver before separation"" and of course because we want to work and provide for our families, that is the mother.

because we want to provide for our families, our spouses don't have to work, they don't have to grow a career and they end up doing the work at home with our children.

And that's where they have us, during separation our lawmakers know that we can make money, because we have been for years, and they know that it takes money to raise children, so they can get us twice, first they make sure that the mother of our children get primary care of the kids, they know that they have been at home not growing a career for year's, and so cant earn as much, so we pay child support, they know that we will have to work more, and so we will pay more tax, while also subsidising our kids mother through child support, they know that if we get primary care or even 50/50 they will not get as much tax revenue, and will have to support both parents even if its what's best for the children.

So how do we combat this? simply put WE can't, those of us that are already in this situation are going to be stuck in it, as long as the cycle continues like this it's going to stay the same.

But what we can do is try our best to teach our sons, and the young adults in out lives to be careful who they have children with, I think that it's great the women have been given greater access to the workplace, but in order for us to have greater access to our children we have to hold our partners to that, we have to be selective about who we have children with and make sure they are contributing to our families finances well before children are involved, and more importantly we have to make sure that WE are involved in our households and the raising of our children.

If we want change so that we are involved with our children after separation, we must make sure we are involved with our children before as well.",7,0

The second article is about a prostitute who uses a male accomplice, I believe. As always, the man gets arrested and the woman (true culprit) is acquitted or ignored.

If you look for news articles or information concerning prostitutes online, you are going to get a lot of sex worker advocacy or prostitution victimization (or highlighting prostitutes who get hurt by men rather than men who get hurt by prostitutes' STIs or prostitutes' crime schemes.) It's sad to live in a society that defends pathological and criminal predators but punishes their infected or robbed victims. Some people, like my own brother, even victim-blame male victims by saying they are dumb for hiring the prostitutes in the first place. Oh boy, I'm happy that prostitution is illegal where I live: some man has common sense here.

But some articles are encouraging me to do some prostitute-busting on my own. It'd be nice to keep those predators from giving hiv and other diseases to local working men. In the beginning, I might start by busting stray prostitutes before those who use male accomplices.

On the dangers of hooking up with women.,"I stumble on this post https://np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/kxs5gp/quarantine_revealed_something_nasty_about_dating/

Apparently, many women are afraid of unfamiliar men. And they have every right to be - though I don't know if murderers really use dating apps to find victims. And if they do, what are the chances to end up with one?

Anyway, that got me thinking about the occasions when women have tricked me or my friends. 

When I was in my early 20s I travelled a lot in Europe, sometimes alone sometimes with friends. Once I in a railway station in Hamburg waiting for the train, my friend left with a young woman. I didn't know what was going on but later on I found out that she had led him to a room where he got robbed. When he started asking about his wallet, a couple of men entered the room. Luckily, my friend manged to escape. This was early on on our Interrail, but he had to return home having lost most of his money. 

Once in Ibiza I went to a bar - or perhaps it was a nigh club - with a friend. A couple of ladies came to sit with us and asked if we could buy them drinks. You have to remember that we were about 20-year-old guys from Finland. Anyway, I warned my friend against it but he was a rich guy, a drunk rich guy, and ordered drinks anyway. When we got the bill the sum was something so insane that even my friend started to get second thoughts. So, we left for the toilet and managed to get out - though there was some sort of strange curtain labyrinth between the toilet and front door -  and then jumped into a car we had rented and drove away as fast as we could. The only time I have driven while heavily under the influence. 

The first time this pattern emerged on my travels was in Athens where I was without company. Nothing terrible happened but the experience was a bit  scary - and educational. A girl about my age started talking with me in the street. She seemed very nice and seemed to be interested in me. After a while she asked if I wanted to go to a caf√© with her. She led me to this murky place without customers and left immediately after I had sat down. Three older, shady-looking men sat down with me and just stared at me talking to each other in a language I didn't recognize. Without thinking I got up, my heart pounding, mumbled something about leaving, and left. Whatever the plan had been they let me go. (Later on I have learned that you should not act like a victim in a situation like that but show self-assurance. Perhaps I did that without thinking about it by not staying but leaving immediately.) 

Anyway, it's a pattern, attractive women targeting young and drunk men and leading them to potentially dangerous situations. As you all probably know already - though I really didn't when I was young. 

Boys and young men should also be at least a bit afraid of women. Also on dating apps.",168,0

I wanted to update the community on where we're at and what's going on with the survey.

"Crazy idea, but should ""making oneself dependent"" also be considered domestic abuse?","So I know a lot of people think domestic violence law in the UK is kinda crazy. ""Controlling"" is extremely vague - if I'm being attacked by a wild dog then I'm trying to control it if I pry its jaws open ... I think it essentially relies on an implicit ""reasonableness"" criteria and I've never heard of a couple have a mess break-up where they considered the other to be reasonable. 

Anyhow ...

Scottish legislation includes ""making B dependent on, or subordinate to, A"". For example, forcing a woman to stop work so she relies on the man for income.

However, surely the inverse is also controlling. If I break my legs or quit my job or make myself dependent in some other way, this would put my SO in a very precarious position - I've put them in a situation when they can't leave without causing a lot of harm. This would be especially difficult if alimony was at play.

"Despite this crowfunding website don't let me to put the ""MEN'S RIGHTS"" tag in a campaign, I still decided to start it for my university project. All earnings will be donated to an Italian domestic violence hotline that helps victims regardless of their gender, and in particular male victims.","[The campaign](https://www.bonfire.com/la-violenza-non-ha-genere/) is in Italian, so I'm sorry if you don't understand it. The title can be translated into ""Violence has no gender"" or ""Violence is not a gender issue"". I had the opportunity to start my activism after my [last video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64Gll25rsmU), where I called some domestic violence hotlines to see if they offer help to men.

As you can see, the campaign is under the ""Women's rights"" section of the website, because **I was unable to put the ""Men's rights"" tag when I started it**: the website litterally refused to add this specific tag when I tried to create a new one. In fact, I was able to add some new tags, but not ""Mens' rights"". LOL

I hope the campaign will do so well that people behind this website understands that there is not shame to support men's rights, because everyone deserves to be heard and helped. **Men are humans**.

This will be the final work for the marketing exam of my university group. I've already told it to my professor, so don't worry for us: there will not be a ""feminist backlash"".

Why the stereotypical view of men is so negative,"This is inspired by from Roy Baumeister's *Is there anything good about men?*

Men,  compared to women, are at the extremes of almost any Bell curve that measures human traits (if there is natural variance and the averages of the sexes are close to each other - like they often are). So, there are, for example, more geniuses and retards among men than among women. 

Furthermore, we humans have this tendency to notice and remember things that are out of the ordinary, the dog bites man kind of stories. And because men are at the extremes we tend to find these extraordinary stories about men much more often than about women. It's much more likely that the richest people are men rather than women. Or violent thugs.

And because we the confirmation bias - we look and see evidence that supports our prejudices - we can easily become convinced that men are successful and evil while women aren't.

But why is successful negative? There are a lot of people who think that success is somehow dubious to begin with. Furthermore, Feminism has managed to tell people that the success men enjoy has not been achieved fairly.

So we see and remember men who are morally disgusting.",4,0

"One more reason why wage gap is a ""statistical error"" (from Roy Baumeister's Is there anything good about men?)","The book is really good (though he sometimes doesn't know all the relevant facts but who would). His point: 

&gt; There is a legal minimum wage. Of course, even if the legal minimum wage were not a factor, there would still be the de facto minimum of zero. Nobody works for a negative salary. A negative salary would mean, essentially, that if you were really incompetent you would pay the company to let you work for them.
&gt; 
&gt; Again assume that the average inputs are exactly the same for men and women: the same qualifications, the same abilities, the same efforts and sacrifices. Assume the average man and woman produce exactly the same quality and quantity of work. And assume that there are more men at both extremes.
&gt; 
&gt; There may be a minimum salary, but there is no maximum. And so at the high extreme, the top-achieving men can pull up the men‚Äôs average salary. Meanwhile, at the low end, the floor (the minimum wage and the zero point) prevents the low-achieving men from pulling the male average back down. As a result, men‚Äôs average salary will end up higher than women‚Äôs‚Äîeven if the average man is precisely equal to the average woman on every single factor that determines salary.

Futhermore he argues that the same mechanism affects grades:

&gt; In many college classes, the majority of students get A grades. Failure is increasingly rare.
&gt; 
&gt; The highest possible grade in most colleges, or what statisticians call the ceiling, is an A. The lowest (the floor) is an F. Over the last couple of decades, all grades have drifted upward toward the ceiling. The floor is far from the average, and the ceiling is close to it.
&gt; 
&gt; The low ceiling will affect the average grades of men and women.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember, we have more men at both extremes of actual achievement.
&gt; 
&gt; The really high achieving men, however, can no longer pull up the male average, because of the low ceiling. There is no grade above an A. (Curiously, many universities do not even permit A plus grades.) Lots of people get A‚Äôs. And so the super-brilliant students get the same grade (A) as the moderately bright and conscientious ones.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, though, the low-achieving males will pull the male average down. There are more men than women getting the really low grades, and as these stand out more and more because of grade inflation, they will exert a strong downward pull on the men‚Äôs average.
&gt; 
&gt; The result? Women will get better grades than men, on average.",5,0
My school experience,"This happened to me in school.

The teacher was an absolute PoS. Generally she was incompetent and disliked, but here is one particular incident involving her.

In our school, it was the practice to stand up and wish the teacher when she entered. Most teachers would wish back- Good morning, children- or something like that. This particular teacher would say ""Good morning, girls"". Reason being that ""Boys behave badly"". She would also ignore any doubts/questions asked by boys, scold boys and let off girls for the same mistakes and had an obvious bias while marking papers.

So one day, we(boys) decided to *not* wish the teacher- why should we, when she disregards us completely? So we did that.

She, predictably, got furious, as we 'disrespected' her. The matter went to the principal and she(principal) initially was very angry but became softer after she heard our point of view. The teacher was reprimanded and we were let off with a ceremonial warning.

To those who subscribe to feminism: you can't expect me not to shiver after a life in the cold. I'm done acquiescing to being treated like something you're entitled to control.,"

[https://preventdomesticviolence.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/R40\_Shift\_2020\_Supporting\_Best\_Practices\_Principles.pdf](https://preventdomesticviolence.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/R40_Shift_2020_Supporting_Best_Practices_Principles.pdf)

I stumbled upon the above document tonight, and didn't expect to have been so effected by it. As a victim of child sexual abuse, reading through the above sentiments really fucking hurt me. I don't have anything, no one really to depend on for emotional clarity but myself; which is more or less the point I suppose, I spent so many years denying the pain of a secret I was waiting for permission to let myself in on. Reading through these guidelines made me feel as though I were back before I no longer had the choice of denial, before I was able to free myself from the burden of absolute responsibility for everything I experience, before I realized that existing as I am and feeling how I feel doesn't make me a monster like him; I spent my entire adolescence painting new masks for every occasion, every clique, every moment. Everything was fine so long as I managed to be anything but Myself. But charades is a party game, and suffice it to say, the party ended when loneliness and isolation set upon my every moment. All that time spent acting, like characters in a vapid sitcom. It's no wonder I remember so very little before my 18th birthday, there simply never was anything real to remember; how could I have been so content to live as little more than a means by which to satisfy the situational approval of others? I let myself down, and lost 10 years of my life as a consequence, not to mention all those ""friends"" I spent so much time pleasing and trying to impress. Frankly, I don't want to do that to myself any longer, regardless of whatever people may think of me, I need to vindicate myself against this strange fucking contempt I've shown for myself. So honestly fuck it, why should I second guess my desire to standup on behalf of my own experiences and feelings?

These are emotional claims, though I could certainly condemn them empirically also, however, in this instance, I feel uniquely justified in just being fucking angry about these ""best practices"".

How the fuck do these people find it remotely appropriate, or necessary to teach boys why doing harm to other is wrong? As if I couldn't possibly understand what it feels like to be violated, to be voided of trust and security, to be hurt and to keep being hurt and feel it's okay because no one ever told you it wasn't? As if the only way for my own experiences to matter is dependent on it's relevance to the well-being of others? How fucking dare these people presume the authority to insist upon what my obligations should be, and how exactly it is I ought to behave.

Anyone who is capable of selectively defining a boy's trauma in their own adulterated words for purposes which benefit ANYONE but the boy whose trauma they are addressing, without even bothering to pretend as though they have his interest at heart (god forbid, as a fucking priority), is clearly a deeply immoral person. Why should I matter any less than anyone else? What the fuck gives them the sense that's it's okay to assert MY complicity in the perpetuation of the very violence to which I was victim? Fuck these people. Honestly, I'm done being nice about this, if they want to make me the enemy of their perfidious cult, fine, whatever the fuck it takes to prevent them from doing further harm to innocent boys on the basis of THEIR OWN PROJECTIONS. I am not responsible for the falsehoods, biases, and down right hateful opinions of others. This has to stop. Insisting that boy's are somehow complicit in a system WHICH DOES NOT EVEN EXIST by using satire-worthy double-speak terms like, ""compassionate accountability"", is simply an unacceptable way to treat children.

I felt disgusting, ashamed, and monstrous even without the help of feminist indoctrination, had I been taught to accept those feelings perpetuated largely by MY trauma as realities intrinsic to my identity as a boy? The self-hatred I suffer was once so intense that I fell into a habit of scaring myself with searing metal-tweezers; had I been made to internalize the voice of this document, I'm confident the extent of my self-harm would have fair surpassed merely a wrist covered in burn scars.

Statements like this one:

&gt;Is the program focused on building empathy while not devaluing women or reinforcing the idea that men need to protect women? Does it acknowledge and respect the harms men themselves may have experienced without losing focus on the harms they may have perpetuated?

And

&gt;Does the program create a safe place for men and boys to understand their roles and responsibilities in ending violence? Are safe spaces created for diverse men and boys to learn, reflect, and change?

Seriously? How fucking stupid do they think males are to accept this shit? These feminist ideologues go OUT OF THEIR WAY to clarify that the ONLY reason they're aren't stating, in plain terms, that which they believe is not out of a concern for boys\` well-being. Of course not. Rather, the use of meaningless jargon is employed so as to ""facilitate this process in compassionate ways in order to prevent disengagement, resentment, and backlash"", as opposed to the myriad potential harms this psychopathic conspiracy theory is likely to cause a boy in terms of shame, self-hatred, alienation, and absolute demoralization.

Just a final message to anyone capable of looking through the document and not finding it shockingly appalling, and indeed akin to a form of compulsory psychological child-abuse: no, I DO NOT acknowledge my male privilege; no, I AM NOT complicit in an imaginary system you believe to have been created by boys and men for the purpose of abusing women and girls; no, I DO NOT need your approval as a victim of sexual abuse; no, YOU DO NOT get to claim responsibility for my own sense of morality; no, I DO NOT owe restitution to anyone for existing as I have always done: innocently.

If I were capable of submitting to this nonsense, and somehow retained some iota of rationality, I wouldn't waste time in discussions of my ""male privilege"" (whatever the fuck that even means). Nor would I waste my time digging deeper into my cognitive dissonance regarding the illusion that feminism in its current form actually cares about my well-being, I'd simply accept the claim being offered: even in treating a traumatized boy, the goal is not to help him, merely it is to mitigate the threat he poses to women and girls; males are obstacles at best, and threats at worst, and the traumatized one's pose an even greater threat, thus as the well-being of boys and men was never a concern, the absolute most feminist action a male can take is suicide. Right? We're not going to talk about realities. Like the fact that 80% of suicide victims are male, or that 1/6 isn't a particularly dissimilar proportion to 1/4, or any other issue which shows males as a population in clear need of help. We only discuss male mental health after the latest school shooting, that is: another incident of a mass-murder suicide. What the fuck am I to make of that except to say that we clearly don't mind suicides in which the sole victim is also the perpetrator, in fact, we might prefer it when men and boys take their lives, provided he does it out of sight, so as to avoid subjecting potential witnesses to the burden of his last failure.

While it's true the awareness to the fact that, contrary to popular belief, men and boys do feel pain and they do suffer, has risen through the years, I cannot help but feel I'd prefer silence to an awareness which castigates me as an accessory to be used. I'd much prefer to be treated as invisible than to be treated as dangerous. To be treated as damaged and THEREFORE dangerous is beyond what I can handle. Time and time again, the world makes itself clear to me: it doesn't care about ME, and when it appears to, I'll never need to look very hard before I find the catch. I feel demoralized, maligned, and willfully misunderstood; if I could pretend not to feel I would, but I can't do that when someone else's words reveal the truth that indeed I do feel, but does so only in order to redefine those feelings in service of it's own goal.",23,0

Not too long ago, I was reading comments on YouTube about circumcision, and I found a comment suggesting having boys castrated after birth.

Here's what the person said in their comment:

**""I think castration on boys shortly after birth should be legal and should be a option made by the parents like how circumcision is. Think about it, a lot of women's lives would be better and safer if most men were castrated, since less¬†women would get raped or murdered and they wouldn't get harassed and stalked by men, and they wouldn't be sexualized in the media and in fiction all the time. Also men tend to be violent because of their testosterone level, so there would be less violence in the world if most men were castrated.¬†And also, if most men were castrated, they also would do better in schools and behave more better. So I¬†think societies would be a way better place if most men were castrated.**

**And also, the idea I have in order for women to still get pregnant is that have the men who are not castrated paid large amounts of money to donate sperm at sperm banks. Or we can start creating artificial sperm or find another way to get women pregnant without the need of sperm.""**

I think the person's comment got deleted since I can't find it. But recently I stumbled upon another comment that is similar, but the main thing that was different with the comment was that instead of castration, the person was suggesting that the whole glans of a boy's penis should be amputated shorty after birth. And like with the castration comment, the comment actually received a couple of likes, and some people commented back, saying that they agree with it.

As I said, it seems like our society now thinks that nearly all men are bad, when it's actually only very few men out of the whole male population. It now seems like our society is now a misandrist society.

Even if these are just jokes, they are a very fucked up thing to say. Circumcision is already bad enough, we don't need worse stuff like castration and amputating the glans of the penis to start happening.

Politically, in the US especially, the idea of men's rights appears to be one sided. With one side ""advocating"" for it and being called misogynistic if they do and the other embracing the ideology of feminism and toning down masculinity to atone for perceived past transgressions, it seems you can't share the MRA belief across lines. 

I'd like to believe this crosses all walks of life, regardless of race, politics, religion (excluding overtly gender biased believers) or other uniquely defining characteristic. Fighting for your children, your physical and mental welfare and ensuring you have an open and non-judgemental support system along with an equal voice to women in all aspects should be a right for all men. 

Unfortunately, it would seem if you're on the left, you're beholden to the ""smash the patriarchy"" beliefs. Since Men's Rights are about mental well being, equality in outcome given an even playing field and addressing glaring issues with the declining performance and health of boys and men, I'd hope this is more than an echo chamber for one side. Without both sides actively taking a stance, I perceive the MRA will always be shouted down by the feminists and their followers which exist solely on one side.",25,0

edit: so seems it hasn't done anything exclusively for women (except for the war-time thing) but that's fine, because at least it doesn't pretend to do stuff for women.",28,0

Sexual trauma and men,"I'm a victim advocate and I'm in a training on male survivors and sexual trauma and my heart just breaks. I'm hearing stories after stories of men abused as children and how men don't disclose the abuse till wait later in their adult life. 1 in 6 men have been abused and assaulted and it's believed that the number is higher and its just not documented. I feel that society tells men ""to man up"", ""don't be weak"", ""deal with it"" and it's not fair. Survivors of sexual abuse have increased challenges with relationships and substance abuse and I feel there's not enough safe space for men to discuss such issues. As a society, we need to encourage men to speak up and to help them heal. I suggest you take a moment and watch [survivors stories ](https://youtu.be/2p06x-yumc0)

Computers use languages as instructions. Any meaningful sequence of signals is a language. 

Languages can act on languages to change themselves. 

Replace ""male privilege"" with ""male achievement"". This is an interesting experiment in language.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see from this video, the majority of kids know that the gender wage gap is **FAKE AND BS**. It's only the kids that have been raised by feminist parents or been taught fake feminist beliefs in school that believe this nonsense.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a fact that women shop more and do a lot of other things while men are physically stronger and are better at sticking to a single task than women, and A LOT OF KIDS ACKNOWLEDGE THIS. It's not until feminists start saying ""Gender is a 'social construct' and women and men are completely equal"" that these kid's minds are screwed up.

&amp;#x200B;

Many feminists will argue that it is these kids that are not ""educated"" enough, yet there is clear proof here by even some kids who **see the real world and see the work place** that it is common sense that the gender wage gap is **COMPLETELY BS.**

Because you are not entitled to demanding people take care of kids that are not theirs.

&gt;HE LED ME ON WITH FALSE HOPE

&gt;But after another two months he told me it was over ‚Äì he couldn‚Äôt accept my daughter. He led me on with false hope and absolutely broke my heart. I was just blind to the fact he wouldn‚Äôt be a stepdad.

Why the resistance to make responsibility gender-equal?,"Let's be painfully honest: today a female points your finger at you publicly, then cries/screams/accuses at you, depending on the intensity of the action you are doomed: jailed, beaten, or at least restrained to be arrested. That's a huge lot of power from a class that's supposedly oppressed.

It's extremely worrying that people influenced by feminism appear to do anything possible to prevent that privilege from changing, and it's hard to tell if it's plainly because of too much ideology or simply certain people to remain in certain power...

For example, I think it's very profitable to run organizations where people are paid to ‚Äúaddress misogyny‚Äù. What's the incentive to combat something whose very existence means I get paid a huge salary? (people in these organizations usually have higher-class-life enabling salaries)

why all men are sexual.,"(This is a conversation I just had on some online chat support website. Since some women seem to always complain about men being sexual, I decided to text some woman to try to help understand the issue.)

Female: Hey there. Welcome. What brings you here?

Me: I am a male fighting intimate thoughts. I need to remember that bare intimacy in a bedroom is dangerous for me.

Female: Could you give me a reason why you think this is a problem?

Me: Wait, you don't know sex is dangerous?

Female: Too much of anything addicting counts as an addiction and we all know addictions don't end well. But what gives you the impression sex is dangerous for you? Has anything led to this?

Me: I've received a lot of sex education. So you'd have sex with anyone?

Female: Personally, I wouldn't. But we are all human and we are made to be intimate. It's how nature makes us reproduce. I'm assuming given that question, you would? Correct me if I'm wrong.

Me: No I wouldn't. And you wouldn't too. Because it's dangerous. It's like saying ""I don't jump into fire, but you can do it."" Do you think I'm that stupid?

Female: It can be yes. But it's not life threatening. There's certain limits to be taken. Sex can lead to consequences that are dangerous. The act itself isn't much so. 

Me: oh ok, well thanks for taking 9 minutes to finally accept that sex is dangerous, which was a fact I had already started the convo with. I literally started the convo with that fact, and we had to waste 9 minutes to reconfirm it.

Female: So you're saying sex is dangerous and you want to avoid intimate thoughts. I'm not saying I disagree with your statement but I don't agree to all of it. Sex isn't a bad thing, if you don't control yourself and there's a mutual understanding between everyone involved, it's ok.

Me: So if I have sex with someone under mutual agreement, and then get hiv, its ok.

GF Pregnant,"Topic: GF Pregnant due in July. No plans to get married or live together. State Florida 

Goal: Establish paternity, establish fathers right, come to a paternity agreement i.e. how many nights each parent gets. Calculated CS and get and in the system and start paying. 

I've gone thru one divorce so I have an idea how the legal system kind of works in Florida but this one is a little different. GF is pregnant right now and the goal right now is to have a healthy child. We talked about how things would work and typical women can never get a straight answer. 

 I'm wondering at one point I need to seek legal advise. I think a one hour paid consultation now would probably answer some questions now, but its probably way to early to pay a retainer. 

Based on my research, when the child is born. I can be listed as the father on the birth certificate, that doesn't really mean anything. I may be asked to sign a voluntary paternity  acknowledgement, that's a big NO. Ideally we would work together on a paternity agreement that includes a paternity test to just be 100%. My guess she will balk at it. 

So what's next? hire a lawyer and serve her with papers? At the time of the birth she will on Medicaid, she has a job and income, but she was able to sign up durn the covid shut down no questions asked. My research says if your on assistance which includes Medicaid she has to help the State locate the father an establish paternity. So I may get a free test there. But they don't get involved in timesharing or other parent issues. 

So what do you think fellas? not looking to avoid anything. Just wanted to be ahead of the ball and pay my fair share and be part of the Childs life. Am I overthinking this or will the pieces fall in place. What are some pitfalls to watch out for?",14,0

Munsnet (UK) - avoid like the plague!! Biased Moderators.,"A few months ago, my wife initiated a divorce. Obviously this was an upsetting time for me, so in order to get a woman's perspective.

* I was told in no uncertain times:
* I would lose all of my assets
* I wouldn't see my child at all.
* If the wife couldn't afford the remaining mortgage, I would be 'locked in' for the next 14+ years to paying the mortgage and having that debt hanging over me to prevent me buying/renting again.

**As it turns out that advice was bollocks.**

In reality:

* I gave 60% of the equity of the House in cash (more, based on her being the primary caregiver).
* I retained the marital home.
* I gained 3/7 nights and a good proportion of the holidays giving me 3+ nights per year (important for childcare as well as child maintenance costs).
* My pension, as it was largely pre-marital, I gave her 20% of the pot.

So, I went back, politely to leave a comment on the site. The idea was to leave a post, so future men can see what the reality is like, in accordance to Section 25 of the Matrimonial Act.

As you can imagine, I was immediately beset by screaming banshee's on the site. Some posters were reasonable, other's indulged in 'fantasy roleplay' claiming:

* I must have a small dick.
* I would forever be alone.
* Other inane baiting.

The moderators, acting in accordance to the leanings of the site deleted the thread, hoping to gaslight  men in similiar situations.

In real-life (not just mumsnet poster''s fantasies) I know of men who 'give up' and pay child maintenance, rent and mortgage and basically work as indenturered servants.

The moderators not only deleted the thread, but they also deleted and banned the account.

There are radical feminists who think that the world would be a better place if all men were gone or at least if the male population was reduced to ten percent. What's your opinion on that?,"How would the world be a better place if all men were gone? 

A lot of women tend to think that all men are bad just because of the crime statuses. U.S Department of Justice homicide statistics 1980-2008  Of all homicide victims, 76.8% were men and 23.2% were women. 67.8% of those homicides it was male on male crime. 21% was male on female crime. The rest of 11.2% is female on female crime and female on male crime. 

Just because most violent criminals are men, it doesn't mean most men are like that.

Here's a quote from radical feminist **Sally Miller Gearhart**: **""\`Why have any men at all?' wrote Sally Miller Gearhart in a 1982 manifesto titled \`The Future‚ÄìIf There Is One‚ÄìIs Female.'¬† Gearhart is an advocate of ovular merging, a process that involves the mating of two eggs, which has been successfully accomplished with mice.¬† Only female offspring are produced.¬† I've always worried that one day women would figure out how to get along without us and they would be able to reproduce unilaterally, like sponges.¬† It's not genocide, exactly. It's more like job attrition, the way employers cut back positions without actually firing anyone.¬† \`A 75 per cent female to 25 percent male ratio could be achieved in one generation if one half of a population reproduced heterosexually and one half by ovular merging.' according to Gearhart.¬† \`Such a prospect is attractive to women who feel that if they bear sons, no amount of love and care and non-sexist training will save those sons from culture where male violence is institutionalized.'""**

Sally Miller Gearhart has a theory that the only way to save the world is to reduce the number of men to ten percent of the total population.

I think I just solved a bit of the problem with abortion,"This popped in my head and I just put it into writing as quick as possible but still.

If the father doesn't want to take care of the child he can sign something before the birth that means he is not the father (it would basically mean that he wouldn't be the father in the eyes of the court and wouldn't be responsible for the child. If he wants to he can still be involved with the child but in the eyes of the government he wouldn't be a parent, meaning that if the mother wants the child she can take it and the father cant do anything about it). If the father wanted to be the father than he would still have to sign something that would mean he is the father of the child and in that case everything would remain the same as it is now. If the father knowingly abandons the mother of the child before birth than he will be listed as the father and would have to pay child support and all the other stuff. However if the father is not informed about the fact that the mother is pregnant with his child and is only informed after the birth than he does not have to take care of the child in any way. In this case the father can still sign the thing (contract?) that makes him the father in the eyes of the government without input of the mother. The mother can also sign away their responsibility of the child to the father (this must also be done before the birth and if done after birth the father must be in agreement otherwise the mother must pay child support). All of these can be signed after the birth as long as both the father and mother are in agreement. If both the father and mother do not want the child they will then be allowed to have an abortion or the baby will be put up for adoption after birth.

My experience with the difficulties of feminist men's communities,"Let me start off by saying I have been an active feminist for decades, but over the last 5-10 years my interest in men's issues has grown. I think feminism has been built on a solid foundation and developed a lot of useful tools and concepts.

However the difficulty I have with feminist communities is lack of willingness to introspect or address toxicity within the community. I have been a member of /r/MensLib for quite a while now, and have heard many members discuss this problem. However, these posts are almost always deleted.

For me the last straw has been recently. About a month ago I made a thread discussing the issue, but it was swiftly closed by a mod and said hat the tone was too much about feminism and not enough about men's issues. To me discrimination against men is absolutely a men's issue, and discrimination from feminists is an extremely pressing issue.

After about 3 weeks I had thought about it a lot, and discussed with many other users. At that time I decided to make a new thread, being extremely focused on the issue at hand, and making it clear my problem isn't with feminism as a whole but only with sexism.

Disappointingly, this thread was closed within a few hours. The reason the mods gave this time was that it wasn't ""concrete enough"" and a bit of ""gender war"". I sent several messages over the next week looking for clarification and to ask for help to improve the thread. This culminated when the mods made it clear: 

&gt;We don't allow posts that focus on feminism, because fundamentally feminism as a movement is not about men. There are times and places that constructive criticism of specific feminist spaces or movements can be appropriate, but when a post on our subreddit is about feminism or about experiences in feminist spaces, it inevitably winds up being unproductive and attracting a huge anti-feminist contingent, regardless of how benign the intentions were behind the post. 

This is extremely disheartening for me. The community had been built with the assertion that the focus is on men. Here is a quote from the MensLib wiki that I strongly agree with:

&gt;MensLib is a movement and community specifically to identify, discuss, and address men's issues, and to support men. Because women and women's issues are often closely related to men's issues, they often are introduced into our discussions by way of complement or contrast‚Äîbut our priority is always on helping men and tackling the issues they face. 

Unfortunately, it seems that the opinion of the staff has changed since that wiki was made.

I feel I am at a great loss. I am not certain that a feminism-allied movement can truly address men's issues if their first priority is to shield feminism from criticism. I don't think that oppression of men is something that should be ignored. Although I have had many problems with the MRA community in the past, at the moment I feel it is the only men's movement that can truly address sexism in all forms.

While I think that feminism is compatible with true equality, I do not think that feminist communities can help move equality for men forward (besides standing aside and being allies). 

For reference, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/ks5yvg/struggling_with_sexism_within_our_community_at/) is the second thread, and I have pasted the OP below:

&gt;As a feminist interested in men's issues, I find one of the biggest barriers to progress is our own communities. It feels very difficult to talk about men's issues in feminist spaces, and moreover difficult to criticize problematic behavior within the community without it being reframed as either being ""anti-feminist"" or ""you just don't like that person"".  
&gt;  
&gt;In particular, I find this problem is worst when a high-profile female feminist expresses anti-male sentiments and a male feminist attempts to address the problematic behavior. In this situation the woman is defended, while the male is silenced. I think this makes the problem worse by reinforcing the idea that the problematic behavior is correct, and that those saying it isn't are just sexists. It also emboldens those who hold similar opinions. There simply isn't the community support to combat anti-male sentiment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Without the ability to address sexism within our own movement, it's difficult to imagine we can make serious progress in society at large. This is an issue I've been struggling with, and talking to both feminists interested in male issues and feminists in non-male rights communities has only made me feel less confident about my ability to combat sexism, and our movements ability to combat it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for any opinions, advice, or points of view anyone can offer. I appreciate it a lot!",208,0

Dear America...,"Now that the election is over, and the leftist ideological cabal - feminism, socialism, corporatism, social justice, BLM, Antifa, etc - have taken control, how long will it be until you stop blaming everything on white males?

A few more questions:

1.  How much do you want, up front, as a one-time payment for all the perceived ills?  From reparations for slavery, to sexism, racism and all the other crimes of people who have long since died?  Name your price!

2. If you refuse to take money up front as a final payment, then what are you asking for?  You just seized control on a global scale. The Oligarch's now have control, and control of all social media, all legacy media, all of the banks and banking systems, and almost everything else.  What more are you asking for? 

3. Men in the first two decades of the 21st century have paid, and paid hard, for simply being fathers and husbands. They are the sole net providers of tax dollars, and they overwhelming occupy the most dangerous job positions in the Western world- black, white, Latino and all other men. If this subjugation is not enough. What do you see as the final answer? How much more suffering will be necessary to erase the debts of our ancestors?

4. Media ridicules white males on a constant basis - all day, every day, in bizarre ways - how much ridicule will be enough? Do you have an end game here or should we expect permanent underclass status?

Many men would like simple clear answers to these questions (and others), but anyone who has insights here would be most welcome. I think most men would appreciate honest answers.


Dear Men Reading this.

I suggest you buckle up. Because the likely answers to these questions, if the left were being honest are the following:

1. We don't want to be paid off. We want men to work as long as they live, for as far into the future as we can exploit them, and we want to steal from them at will through taxation and court judgements. You will NEVER be free.

2. The subjugation of all men, everywhere for the benefit of women and the wealthy for all eternity. We want you as a permanent underclass and to shut up about it.  

3. It was never about paying off the past. We want to take what is yours and in order to get enough votes to do so, we have to make it sound like you are benefiting more than others. That riles people up and makes your very existence seem unfair.  We accomplished this. Now shut up and get back to work. Loser.

4. You as an underclass IS the end game. We are about 90% there now. Enjoy the 10% while you can.  If you are extremely good looking, or one of the wealthy elite, then you are in the top 3%. The other 7% we keep there as an example of how men have it so good, to keep the peasants from complaining.

I believe the best way to fix the issues with gender equality toward men is fixing the disparity in dating and desire,"Every man knows this, most women have so many options and most men often don‚Äôt have one. You go on a women‚Äôs tinder and she has 10 times as many matches as you have. Women are discussing with her friends at the bar about which guy to go back with, and most men are hoping one women gives them the time of day. Why is this the case? What can be done to fix this? I believe I can explain this and provide a solution.

Let‚Äôs first start with male and female biology and psychology. Women are attracted based on emotions and men are attracted based on looks. Obviously looks and how the person makes you feel matters to both men and women, but this is what it takes for men and women to decide if they would be willing to sleep with each other. This is stuff that goes back to our cavemen days. Most guys though are mediocre to clueless on how to attract a women. Women however don‚Äôt need to know how to do anything but look good. Most girls look good enough to at least have some guys hitting them up. Men are hoping just one responds. Here is the core issue with this:

Men want to win the girl over and then have her wanting to come back. Women want to be won over and then when they are, they become emotionally invested in the guy. She wants to then chase down this guy afterwards to make him hers. A perfect dating world is men can all feel confident talking to women to have options and then women can have guys that are interested they can chase and try to win over. Women still like all the attention for sure. Who wouldn‚Äôt get an ego boost with so many people wanting you. That‚Äôs why girl‚Äôs egos when it comes to dating is so high. Any person with that kind of attention will look at themselves as the prize to these people. Women hardly act on a man that chases and comes off as him needing her. 

The dating world needs an equal but different ego boost for guys and girls. Guys can feel ego boosts from getting the girl and getting her to come back for more. Women can get theirs from guys approaching and showing interest in them. A man should work to get her interested and a women should work to keep a man‚Äôs interest. The problem is, this ideal world would never be possible with the current dating disparity that exists between men and women. This disparity gives women unique power in the dating world. They can get away with what many men would consider ‚Äúunattractive‚Äù qualities as compared to men. 

Zodiac signs for instance is one thing I think most guys don‚Äôt care about or flat out dislike when a girl is way too into it. If you just like it for the fun of it but understand it is not real and don‚Äôt take it seriously, that‚Äôs cool. However, there are so many girls whose personalities are shaped by their zodiac sign. That is so unattractive to me as well as most other men. I also don‚Äôt want to talk about zodiac signs online or on the first date at all. Think about it like this, unless a women said she is a big football fan, don‚Äôt talk about last nights game on the first date. To me, it is the equivalent of something to talk about in depth with your girlfriends later on in certain circumstances and not with guys you‚Äôre just meeting. The thing is, unlike men talking about ‚Äúbro‚Äù stuff on the first date or in messages before meeting, women can talk about something like zodiac signs and still have interest from lots of guys. 

The main point I am trying to prove here is men can‚Äôt get away with not being the type of guy women want as compared to women who can get away with not being the kind of guy men want. If the disparity in dating did not exist, this would not exist. Men with lots of dating options will not give women with bad qualities the time of day beyond more than sex for the most part. If all men had options like how women do, we would be able to naturally reduce female toxicity in relationships the way women can with men. If no simps were out there rewarding the toxic girl, it would force her to change or suffer the fate many men out there have which is being alone. It‚Äôs bigger than just in relationships too. If nearly all men had enough options to feel confident about turning down the crazy feminists, then there would be real life punishment for the toxic viewpoints. 

I believe the end of quarantine is the time men need to make this happen and take charge. We have a unique opportunity where so many women have not been flirted with in real life for over a year and are dying for it. We as men have to get off of dating apps where women have control over whether you will even match and get a chance and just go out and talk to women in real life. I am not just talking picking up girls at bars and nightclubs, I am talking just meeting girls during the day, having fun conversations, and getting numbers to set up dates. Most men however don‚Äôt know how to properly do this because it was never taught to us. As men, I believe this is something we should all know and we need to make as mainstream as possible as fast as possible. 

Women do a great job making information about looking best for a man mainstream. Every woman knows exactly what soaps to use for reducing pimples, best makeups, etc. They all know how to look a certain way to attract men who are attracted to what they see. Men need to make information about attracting a women based on how we make her feel mainstream. I think just teaching young men from a young age in high school just how to talk to women in a very general sense when there is less pressure and women don‚Äôt even know what they want yet is how we fix this. There are so many youtube channels and course teaching all these methods and ideas to get the hottest girls and most men watching those videos just want to understand how to talk to women in general. We need to teach men the baby steps when they are babies in the dating world. 

I notice so many guys in high school or middle school either feel like it is hopeless or just don‚Äôt care and they should. The truth is, many of the guys that seem to get girls easily in college and later on in life did many cringy things in high school that would have cost them later on. As a man, you have to go through these things when you can get away with them to an extent which is high school. Many men either don‚Äôt learn the basics or don‚Äôt try to and when they really want a girl in college, everyone else is far ahead of them and they have the dating knowledge of a 16 year old. It is quite hard to become great for a 25 year old when you haven‚Äôt even approached a girl in real life before. Expecting someone to go from that to master pickup artist is crazy and unrealistic. 

So to conclude, I believe this is how the disparity can be fixed: men need to learn right now how to approach women in real life and take full advantage once quarantine is over and we need to teach high school kids to very basics so they can learn all the other things naturally through experience. We need to teach men in general how to become their best selves before they are in their 20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs and never learned how to get women and have to play catchup which is so incredibly hard.",16,0

Definitions of Feminism,"Obviously, the dictionary definition is a smokescreen. Feminism has never been about equality. John the Other's definition would seem to pretty accurate:

‚ÄùA doctrine built on the pre-supposition of victimhood of women by men as a foundation of female identity. In its goals is always the utilization of the state to forcibly redress this claimed victimization. In other words, the proxy use of violence and wealth appropriation. In whatever flavor, and variation, these two basic features are common to every doctrine using the label feminism. Feminism is therefore, a doctrine of class hatred, and violence.‚Äù (John The Other, ‚ÄúWhy not date a feminist?‚Äù A Voice For Men, 4 June 2012.)

"Why do people automaticaly identify the topic of ""gender equality"" exclusively with feminism?","I study medicine, and beside useful subjects i also have a lot of useless faculties, one of them being sociology. For today's class, a group of my peers had to give a lecture on ""gender as an aspect of social stratification"".

If i were to prepare that lecture, i'd want to compare inequalities men and women face, how could it affect their social position, and then leave it up to the students to make up their own minds on who is more disadvantaged in our society. I figure this is the most fair and objective way to approach that topic.

Unfortunately, doing anything of sort didn't even crossed my peers' minds. Their lecture was a long, feminist rant of both real and imagined inequalities women face, that only mentioned men in context of opressors and a problem that needs to be taken care of.

There was no mention of inequalities in labor market causing men to take up more dangerous jobs, no mention of how women are given exclusive parental rights in 60% of cases opposed to 5% of men, no mention of inequality in retirement age and a system that treats men like disposable work machines, no mention of how men are forced to parttake in military and are treated like disposable within it, no mention of any other issue that men face.

Instead we got gender wage gap, glass ceiling, toxic masculinity and even manspreading. Why do people only identify gender equality with feminism? Why does everybody refuses to acknowledge problem men face?",248,0

I'd like to use this post as a catalysator to inspire setting up more MRA websites in the countries where there still aren't and to advertise and raise awareness about the present ones. Those are just examples. Among others, in the Anglosphere, Latin America and Spain are also numerous respectively.

Therefore many MRA websites have already existed before, especially in major countries, but there's still a lack in many others, especially minor ones. They can be used as an information and news source (on a national level), as communication plattforms, meeting other MRAs from your country, as a hub for organizing protest marches or MRA conferences and public activism, etc.

Maybe you feel like setting up one in your country too, up to you, feel free about it üòÅ",12,0

"One area that feminism has failed to liberate women is around childcare. And I don't think this is a coincidence. Everything considered equal, the trade-offs that parents make greatly benefit women at the expense of men.","The focus on unpaid and emotional labor that feminists talk about actually reinforces traditional gender norms, including the providership gap, the wage gap, and the child care gap.

And while you often see feminists talk about these gender norms, it's usually only done as a way to attack men and paint it as something that harms women, which then prevents men from objecting to it and pointing out how unfair it is.

Instead of seeing this dynamic as exploitive, women everywhere use feminist rhetoric it to justify their lifestyle as ""earned"" through their unpaid and emotional labor (which is a very similar argument that traditionalists use). Men are encouraged to work and do more because their wives and girlfriends cook and clean. It's only fair that he works an extra 10 hours a week and does the yard work because she spent her time caring for him and cooking him dinner.

As a result, men don't have the social capital to say, ""this isn't fair, I think you need to work more, and let me stay home more"". The fact that she works less is justified by this messaging in society, and is then ultimately blamed on him, instead of her life decisions.

She then reaps the rewards in the form of less stress, a better work-life balance, more time at home, more time with the kids, guaranteed financial support, a better home life, better health outcomes, better social support from networking, a longer life, and implicit biases in family court.

That's not to say that there aren't mothers out there giving it their best. But the road that turned them into homemakers is paved by feminism, not the actions of men, or the patriarchy.

[At best, feminism has found an ally with traditionalism, which also helps to reinforce this gender dynamic.](https://www.wokefather.com/egalitarianism/the-embrace-of-new-traditionalists-and-feminists-female-privilege/)

What was the most gruesome crime you have ever learned of?

Trigger warning

The man in the picture is Dan Shisia Matakhaya, a 31 year-old Kenyan police officer.

Ôøº

He was not born with this frightening appearance. What you see is the result of a normal argument he had with his wife.

One day, Matakhaya and his wife disagreed about a house issue. He considered it as a normal argument and later on that day, he left for work. He had a night shift so he came back home the day after, at 05:30 am.

As he had been working all the night, he went straight to the bed to sleep.

This is the moment his wife chose to come and pour acid solution on his face. Then she ran away. But it was not enough for her to spoil his face, she also acted so that he couldn't escape the bedroom. She had poured water on the floor and connected it to electricity. As soon as Matakhaya stepped on the floor, he felt the electric shock.

As he was screaming, his neighbouring workmates came and found him in his despair. They took him to hospital. His life was saved, but unfortunately not his eyes. Now he is permanently blind.

His wife was firstly arrested, then they released her later on bail. Matakhaya forgave her for what happened but he said he is not going to abandon charge against her. He only met her at the court and all she said was that she doesn't know why she did so.

It is absolutely frightening, absolutely insane, absolutely baffling that women can do basically anything and have a chance of having some white knight cops and lawyers and judges excuse their behavior and just release them on bail. The bail thing is stupid in its own right, but this takes it to a whole new level.",1,0

I'm so frustrated,"This is a post about the results of my argument about Men's Rights and Feminism with my friends. It doesn't contain any new information, study or anything relevant. Read this only if you are curious.

I'm a young male and I'm part of a group of friends, all of the same age. We've been friends for longer than 10 years and always openly talked about many subjects. Recently the topic of feminism was brought up because the girlfriend of one of us (also present in the group) decided to share an instagram post about ""fight for WOMEN in domestic violence"". I knew it wasn't going to be an easy pill to swallow but I decided to comment about it and share my views which go in line with some of the arguments also shared here about the issue.

The group has 10 people, 7 dudes (me included), 3 dudettes. It turned into a conversation about HOW WRONG I AM, about HOW OPPRESSED WOMEN ARE and that I'M BLINDLY OPPOSING WOMEN. In that conversation, half were mostly quiet, but the 3 girls and 2 guys were completely vocal against me. SO I decided to bring some numbers up. They started ranting about the validity of those sources, accusing them of lying (numbers about domestic violence comparing men on women and women on men) or accusing the numbers of not being relevant to the conversation (in case of male suicide rate). They rejected the thought that there's no gender based oppression and quite passionately defended that the society was male dominant and female oppressed.

At some point I concluded, there's no argument possible, they just don't want to listen and/or don't want to know/care. So I just shared thetinmen page, the red pill documentary and left the conversation. Now I'm still collecting my thoughts but I'm so sad. I'm realizing that the world is unfair and there are lots of problems but the blame isn't on the 1%, the blame is on the 99% being fucking sheep and preferring to talk before studying and reflecting. I always had a subconscious idea that the ones who I have enough closure to call friends were integral people with whom I could share my views and have a factual argument where it would be possible to reach a logical consensus based on evidence. I'm wrong and I feel lonely.",47,0

Study claiming men are better off after divorce is deceptive,"Some recent posts here and on r/askfeminists have cited [an article in the Guardian](https://web.archive.org/web/20201109021615/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/25/divorce-women-research) that purports to show men are actually better of after separation. With the replies on r/askfeminists heavily censored.

It turns out the article is a masterclass in fake news.

The study cited does not include child support payments. This seems a curious omission, when this was the main complaint given by divorced fathers at the time of the study [see here](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/divorced-fathers-fight-back-over-maintenance-mp-calls-for-review-as-new-child-support-rules-take-their-toll-on-hardpressed-parents-1509072.html).

After divorce men are forced to work more hours to pay the child support, but receive less disposable income because of it. After divorce women may give up any work they have resulting in less income from work - but they still may have a higher disposable income because of the child support.

Counting money women receive and men pay as money men receive, seems highly negligent if not deceitful.

Are modern women and feminists contributing to the rise of men who identify as incel?,"Before anyone blows up at this question, and wants me banned because I identify as incel, I'm simply asking a question and seeking out some honest answers and discussion.

I've spent a fair amount of time in both incel and MGTOW forums over the course of the past few years and there seems to be a common thread amongst both, which is that women today have some very unrealistic high standards and requirements when it comes to dating men, much of this which is be propagated by modern feminism that all women are special and entitled to the very best of high value men they wish to pursue a relationship with, regardless of their own value or what they bring to the table themselves. Therefore there's a whole pool or men which seems to be rapidly growing, who feel they're completely unwanted and unworthy of any type or romantic relationship with women, because the ladies are telling these guys they're just not good enough. This only fuels an already depressed bunch of men into a rage of bitterness and anger, which can sometimes lead to misogyny and hate towards females for being too superficial and vain, which then get stereotyped into a bunch of basement dwelling lazy adult men, which I've found not to be entirely the case with so many of them.

MGTOW's will even acknowledge that there are guys women will right-up reject for not being good looking enough, or that these kind of men are told to wait until they've had their fun in their 20's and early 30's, and will settle down with them when they're no longer desirable to the hot guys they no longer attract, which in way seems to correlate to the same conclusion, only a certain select number of men are even worthy of women's attention in todays dating market.

This points me to Men's Rights Activist Karen Straughan, who said the following...

[***""I know guys who are 35 years old, who are virgins, they have good jobs, they want to have a family, they want to have a wife and kids, and they are just not going to be able to do that, and they know it. Because there is one flaw that would have been overlooked 50 years ago, they would have found some women, some homely, chubby woman who would have been willing to settle down with him, and now that's just not the case.""***](https://youtu.be/SrhgDQjxDaw?t=841) - [Karen Straughan](https://incels.wiki/w/Karen_Straughan)

Having heard this quote many, many times over the past year or so, it really makes me believe she is right in what she's saying, that the requirements women have today when seeking a male partner is ultimately contributing to more and more single and lonely men, many of which then fall into the rabbit hole that is inceldom.

Please discuss, as I really want to have a civil and well thought out discord about this. Thank you.",28,0

The ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù is little more than the projection of women‚Äôs desire for power and they subvert responsibility for this by unjustly placing it on men.,"Hierarchy 

‚Äî

In the female dominance hierarchy, women compete indirectly. All women have various ambitions, but keeping those ambitions secret is key to their success.

If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with how female dominance hierarchies work - just think about how women talk to one another *when they think no men are around listening* 

Women desire having power, status, control of a ‚Äúhigh value male‚Äù, and having more ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù than the other women in her social circle do. But they do not want to *look* like they are grabbing for power. When women have something that other women do not, they will often plot to find ways to either bring that girl down, or raise the rest of the group up to her level (‚Äúhey Jessica, does your new bf have any brothers or friends?‚Äù). Notice how jealous girls get when one of her friends gets a boyfriend. It‚Äôs not that the girls really care about having a specific guy for her, it‚Äôs more that they just want a boyfriend because someone else got a boyfriend. Refer to any of the dating subreddits for stories about this ad naseum...

The female dominance hierarchy is innate in females just as the competitive pecking order hierarchical process is innate in men. For guys, think about the instinctual, subtle cues and body languages that guys communicate to one another when first meeting - often times there is boasting between men to compare accomplishments and victories, to demonstrate status and competence. Much of this is automatic and you don‚Äôt even realize you‚Äôre doing this until after it‚Äôs been said - you probably rationalize by saying that you‚Äôre just making friendly conversation by talking about your interests. Women have their own hierarchy but it is nearly imperceptible to most men. It is this way likely because natural selection meant this was the most effective system for the human species to prosper in. 

‚Äî

Definitions

- Psychological projection - is a defense mechanism in which the ego defends itself against unconscious impulses or qualities by denying their existence in themselves by attributing them to others

- Cognitive dissonance - the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes, especially as relating to behavioral decisions and attitude change.

- Patriarchy - a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it.

‚Äî

Where do morals come from? No not philosophically - where do you first learn about morality? 

For the vast majority of people, it‚Äôs from their mom.

Most social etiquette, rules, norms, manners, etc. are communicated from the mother to the child. Most mothers are often repeating the lessons they were taught by their mother, tweaked by her life experience. Over the generations, an evolution of societal rules will culminate. The problem is that these ‚Äúrules‚Äù often get in the way of the dominance hierarchy. 

Sometimes this is good - Jessica gets a new BF? Guess if you murder Jessica, you could assert your dominance in the hierarchy.  Except one problem - someone decided that murder is bad (even though we find justifications for murder all the time throughout history). So, how do you ascend the hierarchy when many of the most effective tactics are against ‚ÄúThe Rules‚Äù and give you cognitive dissonance?

Subvert the rules by spreading a rumor about Jessica being a slut. Reputation destruction is a bullying tactic that is EXTREMELY common in women - as any woman can tell you if they ever were a teenage girl. This is not something they necessarily grow out of. Look at how politics are done today. Look at twitters cancel culture - which demographic primarily uses that?

If women desire power, and they have to compete with men, but their rules prevent them from overtly chasing power, they must instead subvert the rules by...who can guess it? Reputation destruction.

Instead of competing and grabbing for power and status as a man would - through honest competency and overt competition - many will instead victimize themselves and say that they are ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù and ‚Äúnot allowed‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have access to‚Äù, etc. for whatever it is they desire. 

Think about the wage gap - women STILL claim to believe that it‚Äôs about sexism when it‚Äôs been clearly shown, innumerable times, that employers cannot pay women less than men - if they could, every single employer would hire only women so that they could pay them less. Women, instead, *CHOOSE* careers that pay less on average than careers that men *CHOOSE* to go into.

Nope! It‚Äôs still the patriarchy 

How do women test their man? They make him chase and pursue her. They make him demonstrate his commitment to the idea that she is more special and more unique to him than other women. They mainly desire *his* desire. This also conveniently allows them to dance the line of plausible deniability if they don‚Äôt find him attractive enough - they can easily say that the man perused her and she tried to say no, but that damn patriarchy again forcing women to placate men and be subservient to their will! 


‚Äî

Conclusion


This system of victimization and blame shifting is the greatest example of Sun Tzu‚Äôs the art of war. Subvert subvert subvert. And we men are almost completely unaware of it. 

As time has gone on, the contradictory nature of feminism and women in general is starting to become more apparent. ‚ÄúPatriarchy‚Äù is little more than the projection of the female desire for power.

This dovetails nicely into male disposability theory as well. But that‚Äôa where I‚Äôll stop for today.",15,0

Brainstorm for a new project on men's rights,"I've been thinking on this idea for a time and I want to put it here on the table to discuss it.

**Motive**

I define feminism today as a politically motivated movement that abuses women, manipulating them, undermining their identity and ultimately rendering them vulnerable so indoctrination to their ideology and other forms of extremism becomes easy.

The vast majority of feminists, alienated by that very manipulation, become resented and hostile towards men, some of which also leaks down to non extremists but people that identify as feminists purely due to their definition which is virtuous.

The power for censoring of feminist lobbyist is deproportionate against our attempts to inform people, way too many new people adhere to ideology and the huge majority adhering to feminism are extremely resistant to different views. It's simply a losing battle.

Today I am deeply worried of having to put up with this for the rest of my life, and I honestly simply want out but I don't have the resources to be well informed about how to migrate to a more sane society where one can actually be a man and not be demeaned all day long every time I turn on the TV.

**The idea**

The idea I come to throw here it's to make an online map that properly analyzes and weigh what countries are still a place for men to actually live freely and not fearing false accusations, discrimination by law or general hostility in a day to day basis.

This map could be colored to demonstrate how hostile each country is to men, and all this information can be retrieved and analyzed to affect their score.

A list of ideas of aspects to document and to make up the scores of:

* Since when this country is Influenced by feminism.
* Is there a ministry for women issues?
   * Is it also the one supposed to dictate norms on gender equality?
* Successful lobbying against men
   * Laws
   * How they have influenced the media
   * How many feminists are in the media business
   * Interventions meant to manipulate gender views
   * Interventions with the intent of indoctrinating against men
* Properly referenced side to side comparisons
   * Reproductive rights by gender
   * Marriage rights and risks
   * A table of possible outcomes of trying to exercise a right, by gender
      * Both calculated by interpreting the law and by documented cases
* Media analysis and uploads
   * advertisement and demeaning campaigns
   * preferences and bias on the news
   * hostile reactions to males opinions
   * risk of being physically attacked
   * prevalence of feminism by level of extremism

Ideas of points to research by country:

* Death rate by suicide and other reasons
* Violence in relationships and who does law enforcement favor by default
* Fake allegations and their actual consequences
* Prison sentences by gender
* How the education system discriminates men
* Shelters and other help by gender

Assessed risk of feminism:

* Calculate how solid the culture is in respect of influenciability
   * Does the culture seem to celebrate effort and work
   * Does the culture seem to celebrate victimhood
   * How prevalent is fashion and shallow tendencies

This list is a work in progress and it would be great to be able to expand it with help from all of you.

This is of course a giant task that in no way I can take alone, but it's really needed so we can document this information and make its value last longer than the short lived but massive misinformation directed by feminist lobbyists.

Hopefully we get some Important Results.",5,0

What are your opinions on modern dating and whether it's worth the risk for a male in 2021,"To start, I'm 18 and come from quite a Catholic religious background, and although I still hold some principles from that time and some of the morals are ingrained in me, I'm not necessarily overly Conservative when it comes to relationships, so this question is directed to anyone of whatever orientation /religion, and I'd like it to be noted these are just my beliefs and opinions.

Over the last few years I've been quite hesitant about entering a relationship with anyone, I find it quite hard to trust a partner and overall feel that I am quite jealous, more so keeping jealous thoughts private but my actions can reflect how I'm feeling so I suppose it still needs work. In this way, I am very traditional in the belief that when you're with someone, you are tied to each other and have loyalty to one another. So these open relationship ideas I personally just see as an excuse to cheat and not feel bad about it. Then I also see an influx in young girls starting onlyfans accounts and degrading themselves online, which again I don't think personally I could be with some who shows themselves freely or for profit to others online without first being in a dedicated relationship with them.

I believe these are logical stances to hold but I'd like to hear from others as well.

Now when it comes to the following, I don't like that I think these things but admittedly it is going through my head so here's my more illogical issues:
I'm not comfortable with the idea of thinking about a partners previous sexual history. I dread the day that I'm with a girl for example, meet another dude and they can say ""ha I did x or y, with your gf"". This would be childish and immature yes but there are undoubtedly people like this in the world so I'm not sure how I'd approach a situation like that, which brings in the idea of ""leaving sex till marriage"" which I'm not completely against but THEN you come across the issue of should modern men even be considering marriage due to the unfairness of divorce settlements and the average outcome of relationships at the moment.

I see a lot of men (and women tbf but I'm speaking from my perspective) having a lot of trust issues when it comes to choosing a partner nowadays and it seems like society is just focused on quick hook ups and casual sex based on pure lust and nothing else.

But I've experienced relationships that have meant a lot to me and it seems an awful shame to sacrifice the notion of a future with someone you could potentially care a lot about merely due to the possible negative outcomes.

That's my thoughts, I apologise if they are sort of scattered I needed to rant. I would truly appreciate any anecdotes or opinions from others as to their opinions or positions on effective dating in 2021",32,0

As ive posted before, teachers mark girls higher for IDENTICAL work, to the point where just changing to a.girls name gets a boy 1/3 grade higher mark. as well as punishing boys differently. See below for all the studies. What do you expect when feminsim teaches extreme misnadry, male privelge theory etc.... that feminise teachers will be like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Previous submission got deleted by mod eventually so reposting here... still check it out as many excellent comments from men and women about their experience of this bias... many pointed out very obvious misandric comments from their teachers, some teachers even commented about their biases:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers\_mark\_girls\_higher\_for\_identical\_work\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/)

This is an unpopular fact as it widely held in society that women and girls are discriminated against in education and in work, indeed in everything in life.

Note; below is general statement, countless awesome teachers but....

**Education is an example of institutional sexism. Now this data should to even feminist not be surprising... after all they call male majority and even female majority places as rife with sexism and ""male norms"" i.e. women have to act like men... is it any surprise then in teaching where 98% of early educators are female, 90% primary school teachers are female and these teachers have often studied gender studies type radical subjects at uni, and all HR and admin is female, that there is ""female norms"" being applied in education..... that the default child is a girl according to teachers? As the following data shows e.g. female teachers punishing boys for entirely normal behaviour that they dont understand; marking girls higher for IDENTICAL work, and giving higher predicted grades (despite boys objectively getting higher real life assesments) as they prefer girl students as model students and can relate to girl students better.... it is no wonder that schools are reducing play times, even removing physical education completely and replacing it with in class movement.... i.e. an entirely anti boy environment.... if 40% of boys are being drugged with aderal in some schools, do you think 40% of boys are unwell or maybe its the teachers who are shit and the system they made?**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Over then entire OECD countries globally, a large scale study showed that girls were given higher marks for IDENTICAL work to boys. OECD also showed that a boy receives 1/3 higher grade if the teacher does not know he is a boy. Interestingly this gender gap goes away when it is a male teacher doing the marking.

Cornwell found that boys in all racial categories are not being *‚Äúcommensurately graded by their teachers‚Äù* in any subject *‚Äúas their test scores would predict.‚Äù*

The answer lies in the way teachers, who are statistically mostly women, evaluate students without reference to objective test scores. Boys are regularly graded well below their actual academic performance.

Boys are falling significantly behind in grades, *‚Äúdespite performing as least as well as girls on math tests, and significantly better on science tests.‚Äù*

After fifth grade, he found, student assessment becomes a matter of *‚Äúa teacher‚Äôs subjective assessment of the student‚Äôs performance‚Äù*, and is further removed from the guidance of objective test results. Teachers, he says, tend to assess students on non-cognitive, *‚Äúsocio-emotional skills.‚Äù*This has had a significant impact on boys‚Äô later achievement because, while objective test scores are important, it is teacher-assigned grades that determine a child‚Äôs future with class placement, high school graduation and college admissibility.

Eliminating the factor of *‚Äúnon-cognitive skills‚Ä¶almost eliminates the estimated gender gap in reading grades‚Äù*, Cornwell found. He said he found it *‚Äúsurprising‚Äù* that although boys out-perform girls on math and science test scores, girls out-perform boys on teacher-assigned grades.

The report also found that:

* At primary level 85% of teachers are female. This has remained roughly the same since 2003.
* At secondary level the percentage of male teachers has fallen steadily at first and later precipitously from 40% in 2003 to 31.7% in 2012.

**It has been shown that boys and girls do better in reading when they have a same sex teacher. Just one year with a male teacher reduced the reading gap by 1/3 for 13 year old boys. It has als been shown:**

In another study in the work place researchers asked supervisors to grade two poorly written essays and to provide feedback directly to each writer over chat, so that the writer could improve. At this point, the writers' names (Andrew or Sarah) were revealed, revealing that one was a man, the other a woman. Participants submitted a grade to each writer, as well as substantive comments to improve their essays.

Participants were more likely to tell white lies to the woman writer,  **inflating Sarah's grades nearly a full letter grade higher than from their initial private evaluation. They also gave her more positive comments than they gave Andrew. In contrast, the man's in-person feedback was statistically indistinguishable from the participants' undisclosed evaluations of his work.**

**Please note:** When this study was reported, it was reported as being discrimination towards women as their performance was being upgraded and they weret being given correct feedback, rather than the more obvious statement, that men are being disrimnated against and women work is being marked up.

Boys 'being held back by women teachers' as gender stereotypes are reinforced in the classroom

[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1307856/Boys-held-women-teachers-gender-stereotypes-reinforced-classroom.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1307856/Boys-held-women-teachers-gender-stereotypes-reinforced-classroom.html)

Christian Hoff Sommers explains how boys are being punished for normal behaviours:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFpYj0E-yb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFpYj0E-yb4)

Do Schools discrimiante against boys: Dr. Jim Dueck, author, former Assistant Deputy Minister of Education for the province of Alberta, and former head of Accountability and Student Assessment, performed a revealing analysis on current practices in student assessment. The results were not only remarkable but very disturbing, exposing what might well be an institutional suppression of the performance of male students.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ)

Related, despite a widely held view to the contrary, in a large scale national study, women are favoured 2:1 over IDENTICAL or even slightly more qualified men in STEM applicationss but gender BLIND helps men significantly, and the latter is now becoming less commonly applied as a result.

[https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360)

This could go to explain why many prominent claims of discrimination have failed as there is a perceived bias but on investigation, this is proved false e.g. US womens football team equal pay claim led to the judge saying the women were paid more than men, or women suing Google only for Googles results to show they were paying mens less.

Funding:

Females given $6 billion per year more in grants by government for education despite being the overwhelming majoirty in university

[https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=13620&amp;fbclid=IwAR1zxexkrfKy5VeGcW0IC-hUy6mgUMQS4F8di\_Eyk3ZDt2jhMVgtTcX6WcA](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=13620&amp;fbclid=IwAR1zxexkrfKy5VeGcW0IC-hUy6mgUMQS4F8di_Eyk3ZDt2jhMVgtTcX6WcA)

There are also 11 female only scholarships per 1 male one, with some universities have 100 female only scholarships and none for men, again despite men being a minority in university, and in alsmost all courses (even in STEM technically men are a minority, its only a few specfic subjects e.g. physics, computer science that men are a majority while women are a majority in Medicine, Biology, Nursing, Psychology, Veteniary Medicine etc)

**At home (similar ins school):**

Boys are more likely to receive corporal punishment from their parents then girls ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952896/)). They are also, in general, more likely to recieve severe verbal and physical punishment from both mothers and fathers ([source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227312033_Harsh_Discipline_and_Child_Problem_Behaviors_The_Roles_of_Positive_Parenting_and_Gender/link/55aeac6b08aed9b7dcdda4c0/download)). Some studies indicate the difference is less pronounced at the home and may be non-significant in the first years of infancy ([source](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/113/Supplement_5/1952.full.pdf)), but the difference is still present in the same direction as it is in schools for most of adolescence.

**Can something be done? Of course:**

[http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept06/vol64/num01/Teaching-to-the-Minds-of-Boys.aspx](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept06/vol64/num01/Teaching-to-the-Minds-of-Boys.aspx)

This school took a boy friendly approach. What was applied is explaied in detail. **Boys performance rocketed, gender gap went and girls performance went up nearly as much too.**Current system is bad for everyone but it just s happens it massively favours girls. I think it will get worse bad sterotypes about boys and now literally every other story about manspreading, mansplaining, toxic masculinty, menaretrash (real hashtag on twitter) all will not help. There is no political will... in the UK the head of uni admissions even said she thinks its a scandal no one is doing anything about plumetting uni levels for boys and if any other group it would be an outrage.... Uni of Arizona has 160 female only scholarships and 2 male ones despite women outnumbering men in almost every single degree... in the very few that they dont in STEM (not even all stem, for example more female medics, biology, vets) they are actively recruiting girls but doing nothing for boys

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school/)

Telegraph article on number of men in teaching, and techers openly admitting to sexism in favour of girls:

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html)

I do know from my own direct experience that many young women of the 1960s and 1970s went into teaching inspired by a feminist mission to raise the self-esteem and the social position of girls. I could name at least half a dozen women teachers I knew personally in the later decades of the last century who were proud to say that they favoured girls in class to make up for the oppression of women in the past. The moral dubiety ‚Äì and outright sexist prejudice - of inflicting second-class treatment on little boys who could bear no personal responsibility for those alleged (and profoundly questionable) historical crimes never seemed to trouble those apostles of equality. Men are hardly likely to become primary school teachers because they feel they owe a duty to their sex

By the same token, I can name a similar number of feminist commentators in the media/political establishment who celebrated the rise of educational attainments for girls in school as evidence that females are, by birth and nature, superior to males. As girls overtook boys in grades and exam results at all levels throughout the education system, those sisters were cock-a-hoop at their gender‚Äôs triumph ‚Äì never acknowledging that the advantage of one sex must have been bought at the expense of the other. Not one Secretary of State for Education in the last 40 years has expressed concern that the [gender divide in academic achievement ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/11364130/Girls-do-better-than-boys-at-school-despite-inequality.html)reflected a worrying ethos in schools that imposed disadvantage and inequality on boys. They wouldn‚Äôt dare.

Along with the politicians, men, as a whole, simply gave in to this feminist-driven growth of inequality with the bovine supinity which has characterised their outlook for the last half century.

So a guy my age was legit flirting with me for days and I mistook it for something else,"It was sometimes in November. I was waiting for the bus and asked him when the next bus would arrive. We started talking mainly about Tv shows and then about, music, military serivice, mental health, nutrition, normal stuff. He said I should watch Rick and Morty. We sat next to each other on the bus and I thought I had finally made a decent friend and even asked for his insta (j think that's when he got the wrong idea).At one point I told him he felt like an actual brother since my actual brother has schizophrenia.(before I knew what was going on). I the following days, his uncle died and i was genuinely saying how sorry I was.(again, I think this had a different unintentional effect in him). After noticing that I wasn't having it, He asked in a very vague, indirect way ""i may be wrong but.."" - I don't remember the exact words, but he basically tried to gaslight me into thinking that I was flirting with him, and that's when I laughed in disgust almost, (I have no problem with gay people at all, but I myself am straight) and jokingly asked if he had a crush on me, he said no. I thought it was just a misunderstanding. The next day I wrote him essay how I was sorry if I had given him the wrong impression, and that I was raised to be nice to everyone. I gave him some time after the funneral before invinting him for beers. He politely declined and then he ghosted me completely. It took me weeks before I realized what had actually happened so sadly, none of us got what we wanted. I just thought I'd tell this story here. Has anything similar ever happened to you guys ?",0,0

I want to discuss a bit,"First please don‚Äôt downvote this post to hell, I have very different opinions than people on this subreddit, I want to discuss.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of ""antifeminisme"" on this subreddit and I have to disagree, feminism is a good thing, some posts say that it‚Äôs a ""hate stuff thing"" there are a lot of feminist rally in my town and, even though I haven‚Äôt participated in them I have talked to a lot of people and some of my classmates are very activists, they where always very open to discussion and very kind.

The second point I see a lot is female rape is as big as male rape, now rape is a serious crime that can ruine a person‚Äôs life (that‚Äôs why we should take rape allegations seriously and not make fun of it, that‚Äôs why a lot of rape victims male or female are afraid of saying it) but in the US there are 7.7610058 times more female rape than women.

Than about women‚Äôs abusing men or straight out murdering them, same, according to this source: https://www.thehotline.org/stakeholders/domestic-violence-statistics/
women experience about 1/4 women are abused and 1/7 men are, that‚Äôs a pretty big difference.

My point isn‚Äôt that, what this subreddit seems to think feminism is, that we should put men and women to the same stage, like if you want to make bill gates and some random dude equal, we shouldn‚Äôt give 10‚Äô000 bucks to both

You should talk more to people who have a different opinion. Oh and btw have you ever bed insulted, someone ever said something sexist to you or almost sexually assaulted you in the street because of your sexe ? I haven‚Äôt, all my friends haven‚Äôt but girls have to deal with this a lot.

Toxic Masculinity Doesn't Exist - An Essay,"Toxic Masculinity doesn't exist.  Don't even acknowledge the term.  It's specifically used as a dog-whistle to automatically associate negative traits with masculinity.  Sort of like ""deplorables"" was used by Hillary to disenfranchise poor white voters, how the term ""thugs"" is currently used as a placeholder for the ""n-word"" by racist idiots,  and the sarcastic use of ""religion of peace"" is used by racist losers to refer to Muslims in the media,  the terms aren't meant to explain or highlight any sort of behavior as much as they are used to associate negative traits with certain groups and encourage irrational hate against them.  It's a trigger word used to do what females do best: **causing divisions by way of Relational Aggression.**

&amp;#x200B;

These terms are a form of relational aggression.  They're trying to encourage a culture where open discrimination against men in public places like work and school will be acceptable.  If it becomes publicly acceptable, it's going to become a word used to do nothing other than shame men.    


It should be as offensive to you to have that term ***even be used in public***, just like it is to refer to blacks as ""thugs,"" poor whites as ""deplorables,"" or sarcastically use the phrase ""religion of peace"" when referring to Muslims or Middle Easterners.  Imagine actually using those terms RIGHT NOW in your workplace, school, or other public places.  You would get CRUCIFIED because they absolutely are horrible terms to use and their connotations are KNOWN.  Everyone knows they are placeholders for more hateful words use by trashy low-lifes at the fringes of society.  


Feminists look at *""strong""* female role models and refer to them as ""positive, encouraging, empowering""  but men who have those exact same traits, if they're even allowed to exist in mainstream media anymore, are referred to exhibiting ""toxic masculinity"" ONLY because they're men and for no other reason.  Don't let misandry be publicly acceptable behavior online or in real life.   


Don't answer to or acknowledge the term Toxic Masculinity - it's a losing proposition.  You're getting bullied into working against yourselves by acknowledging it exists.  By answering to it, you're opening the door that allows those conversations to happen and for the environment I explained above to flourish.  Toxic masculinity doesn't exist and anyone that does use it should be looked down on and shut-out.",7,0

Military / Child support and custody battle,"Hey I am joining the Army this month, and will be going in while fighting a bit of a legal battle.

Experiment (MRA side),"OK, so I'm conducting an experiment with this subreddit and r/Ask Feminists. I already know some cases of discrimination against men, such as with false rape allegations, family court, reproductive rights and non-reciprocal cases of domestic abuse and intimate terrorism. Can you give some more examples of cases where men are clearly discriminated against or at a disadvantage where there aren't any uncontrollable variables are at play? And as an aside, do you think gender and race quotas are doing more harm or good? 

For the aside, I don't agree with the gender and race quotas. While they do get POCs jobs, they will never know whether it was on their own merit or if the company decided that they had 'too many white people' or 'too many men'.
 That could cause them to second guess themselves, which could lead to mental health issues down the line, especially anxiety. Also, it means that there might have been a white man who worked his ass off for his degree and prepped himself for the interview, who was relying on the company to hire him since he was qualified for a job they wanted. And he was dismissed because of his skin colour. And if he doesn't know about the diversity quotas, then he would assume that he wasn't the best candidate, so he may delve into unhealthy habits and develop mental health issues of his own, most likely depression.

 So what's the outcome? The POC works at a job they feel like they didn't earn, the white man is unemployed, and both develop mental problems.

"Why are all old people so damn toxic to young men, and why do you think America is failing?","I've noticed that especially aimed towards men, old people are just absolutely cancerous. After having lived with my aunt to help keep her at home for a year, I figured out fast how disgusting old people can be. Ignorant, stupid, childish, rude, demanding, and then add in some hatred of young people and you get an old person. I think they're far outliving their normal age limit thanks to the medical advances fucking all younger people over. We get our inheritance later, we have trouble having children and caring for them, because our parents expect us to drop everything and help care for them 10-15 years, and we get oppressed by an older population that won't let us change the country in the ways we want to. Honestly, that last part is the worst of it. Too many old people hold down the best jobs, and are still in positions of power. Their thinking is incredibly archaic, and doesn't line up with 90% of younger men and women in America. Why is there even a minimum age limit imposed on our presidents? I don't want Joe Biden at his age to be president. He's ancient and his policies are going to favor what old people want, and not the young people that have to deal with them.

This is just my personal experience with older people, and I'm sure many of you haven't dropped everything to try and help someone you thought you knew and cared about. It can be really really terrible. I gained weight, I lost income to help care for her, I had next to no free-time, and I was constantly insulted for being a young man, which I heavily resented her for and still do. Do any others think that old people are really just destroying the country for the younger generation? If not, what else can you blame for the way the country has been heading? Birth rates are down, feminism is up, hatred of men is up, and we're finally seeing people leaving America in droves.

Also, has anyone wondered where exactly our taxes are fucking going? One of the highest taxes in the world and yet we still have nothing to show for it. Where's our cheap healthcare? Where's our fast public transportation like bullet trains? If I lived in Europe, I could visit many different cities by train and add some variety to my life. In America, I have to drive on crowded freeways for hours and deal with the constant threat of a wreck. America seems far behind the times thanks to companies wanting to milk car, gas, and oil sales for as long as possible. I do think America needs to purge that shit and focus on actually improving social growth by improving public transportation and healthcare. Rework the fucking healthcare, for God's sake. It's terrible! I don't even care if every single car company leaves America because of public transportation, because where are they going to go? Not many other countries still need cars, so good luck to those money-grubbing bastards.",14,0

He‚Äôs helped raise her daughter since she was 2.
She pushed (forced) them into a Poly relationship after their 1st year of marriage. 
(Can‚Äôt really call it poly if the husband doesn‚Äôt consent, huh?)
He went to care for his Dad with Dementia in Florida after a year in that situation but they kept in touch.
Then Covid hit and in March &amp; her Polyboy left to shelter with Family. 
She asked him to come up (to Connecticut) to be with her and her daughter. So he packed up the Florida apartment, flew his Dad up into a New Townhome, moved their stuff from the old apartment into the new home.
That was March. July she goes looking for a new guy and found ‚Äúthe one‚Äù in September. She‚Äôs been dating the new guy since. 

He‚Äôs had enough and he‚Äôs divorcing her in February. The daughter, now 14, ‚Äúseems‚Äù to be taking everything in stride but tells him she‚Äôll miss him so much after he moves.

I‚Äôll show him this post after a week of comments. The reason: I want him to know it wasn‚Äôt just coming from me. That‚Äôs why I stated this as informatively as possible.

What do you think are the most positive forms of masculinity?,"It's true that some socially constructed ideas of masculinity (perpetuated by both men and women) end up hurting men. However masculinity isn't inherently bad, and rather than focussing on the negatives we should celebrate the positives. 

So what do you think is the most positive masculine trait?

Personally, I like self-confidence. To me the ""manliest"" men are those who aren't afraid of what society thinks of them or what they will be labelled. Who aren't afraid of being called gay, or dressing weird, and acting like a clown. To me there's nothing more manly than not giving a shit what people think about you. And I think that's a positive thing, and everyone in society should be more confident in themselves.",18,0

How do I support men‚Äôs rights without sounding like an MRA,"On mobile, pardon funky stuff
I‚Äôve always thought of myself as a egalitarian, and when I was younger that believe mostly pertained towards women, though in recent years I‚Äôve begun to notice the men‚Äôs issues and care more deeply about them, as I see them as a bigger threat at the moment. Recently I‚Äôve been watching a bunch of Sydney Watson, shes charismatic, and when it comes to men‚Äôs rights, she‚Äôs not overly red-pilled, though some of her content is. For a while I have been trying to defend both sides of the spectrum, but as a white male, I am finding increasing struggles defending men and coming off as an ‚ÄòMRA‚Äô

Of course, I should specify why I don‚Äôt want to sound like an MRA. I‚Äôm sure many of us understand the difference between a lot of people who support men‚Äôs rights, and MRA‚Äôs, where MRA‚Äôs can be a lot more violent and toxic, or follow in third wave feminism‚Äôs footsteps and practice equality through putting down women, and not picking men up.

I want to support my fellow men in a constructive, helpful way that when talking to misandrists, actually ring a bell, so that they can‚Äôt just dismiss me as a sexist/misogynist. So if anyone has learned to walk this fine line, of supporting men in a way the opposite side doesn‚Äôt see as opposition, but instead a means to the same end goal-equality",33,0

Good movies/shows for young boys?,"Hi everyone,

Been fighting to see my son for 3 1/2 years now after his mom abducted him to her home country. 

Since I applied for the return of our son to his country of residence under the Hague convention, she has waged a brutal war of attrition, using all the classic tools of the trade against me including false criminal accusations and parental alienation. 

What irks me most is that she is feminizing him by having him wear tiaras in public, wearing dresses, and buying him girls' toys like dolls and princess castles. 

He is a real boy though, and whenever he has the choice will always choose classic boy toys like cars, toy guns, Pokemons etc.... 

Lately he's been asking me to buy him girl tv-show related toys that I'm sure his mom is making him watch. 

I'll hopefully be seeing him soon and would like to introduce him to some male-positive tv shows/movies/cartoon series that I'm sure he'd prefer over his mom's choices for him. 

I was hoping for some advice from you guys regarding what I should look into for a boy his age (he's almost 7 now) that would show him that being a boy is ok and to role models that he can ""look up to"" when I'm not around.

My ex and I got into it nearly 2 years ago. She beat me up pretty good left a gash across my chest, bite marks and bruises, she had like 2 bruises from me trying to get her off of me. We both have pictures of the abuse. My mom tried reporting her to my ""mandated reporter"" social worker WHEN IT HAPPENED who did nothing about it.

The videos delete after so long, so she must've recorded on her phone from where I start getting her off of me. So the police cannot get the original video most likely unless they talk to the company who does the security footage as the original deleted. 

She reported me for Domestic Violence, Aggravated Assault, DV in the presence of a child, and criminal mischief all felonies, 2-3 weeks ago, and I got arrested and spent Christmas and a little over a week after that in jail before I was able to finally bail out. This all took place about 1.5-2 years ago. Her and I have been broken up for the last 6 months bc she cheated on me.

 I am in US on work visa and basically from india...

I had supported my wife to help her get masters in engineering after marriage... I had supported her father financially and medically whenever he used to hospitalized... I helped her brother to get job... I have a son from her...

She basically was angry on me that I am not leaving US and coming back to india to live with her parents... 

I my self is a victim of domestic violence... my wife used to hit me with baseball bat, punched me on chest and slapped me many times and used to give me blood scratches by her nails over my body .... 


Long story shot... she wants me to be her slave and when I finally decided to denied that ... she filed all kind of cases on me, parents, sister and her husband ( which is what you get in india... your whole family gets accused into false cases even though they have nothing to do with anyone of you).....

I am fighting my cases in india since 4 years during which I am also not able to speak or see my son due to court orders and many other issues...

I finally left any hope that I could ever talk to him... In india women gets maintenance for life and child support for very long time... I have been awarded maintenance order (to her and my son from date of filing so I have to pay her since 4 years cumulative money) ... that I have started paying right now... 


I am lonely, depressed due to that I had developed diabetes and many other medical lifestyle issues... I am trying to improve my self... I hope i will one day...


I am thinking this question since 4 years ... I did everything that society, law , people told me to do... 

I loved her.. respect and supported her and her family... give to her and her family in needs... respect all women in my life and office and female colleagues... I never cheated or involved with anyone else than my wife... I never went to prostitutes... 

I basically been a best man I can to her... but still for society and people I am a bad guy and looser father...


I wanted to kill my self but somehow come out of that thought... today I have seen a video where a so called rapist got mob justice where people penetrating stick in his ass and dogs eat his groins (penis and balls) alive.... where em he was shouting in pain and people force the clothes in his mouth.... now no body is sure whether he was proven rapist... I felt so much worse about it... I know a case where mob killed an innocent man and hanged him naked... later confessed by girl that she got afraid of her affair with another man and in hurry she lied about this man....but that guy got killed by mob...

I am really afraid of this world... where women‚Äôs words are reality and men‚Äôs innocence is a joke..

Feminists Censoring Logical Fallacies That Hurt Them,"Wikipedia and other pages have been manipulated into removing articles on logical fallacies that harm the feminist narrative.

The most evident one I've been able to find is the article on Apex Fallacy.  It is when people look at the highest positions of power (politics, CEOs, celebrity, etc) and see those positions are held by men. Then they falsely assume all men have that level of power when completely ignoring that it takes a lot of power and generational wealth to get those men into those places..

Why is it ignored? Because it weakens their argument to acknowledge women who were born into the same privlidge always had the same doors opened to them.  This helps secure funding for sexist scholarships, grants, and other government funded programs that ignore young men who never had those opportunities to begin with. It helps out underqualified women in positions of power and privilege they haven't earned.

&amp;#x200B;

It always seem like when there's something about female empowerment, there always has to be women who act patronizing to men because of it. No gender is better than the other. 

Yes, women can be strong and there's many women who are stronger than men are. But then our society needs to stop teaching men to put their lives at risk for only women and expect hem to risk their lives for women in order to support that fact. If women can protect themselves, then why do they need protection from men?

Women can't just act superior to men, and then expect them to help them when they need their help. You can't have your cake and eat it. 

That is what is annoying about our society. They try teaching men to protect women, while at the same time teaching women that they are strong and don't need men. They need to stick to one thing. 

As for the whole ""women can get pregnant and handle childbirth while men can't thing"" that's a stupid comparison. For one, men can't get pregnant, and two, every women handles giving birth differently, some handle it very well while others don't. Also, men are the reason why women get pregnant in the first place. If it wasn't for men, women couldn't get pregnant.",11,0

"Study: Women leaders did NOT do better at handling COVID and the reason it was claimed was due to sexism: hyper-focusing on good women, ignoring bad women, hyper focusing on bad men, ignoring good men (the study is generous, women leaders actually did significantly worse)","[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9102585/COVID-19-Countries-led-women-NOT-fared-significantly-better-pandemic.html?login#newcomment](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9102585/COVID-19-Countries-led-women-NOT-fared-significantly-better-pandemic.html?login#newcomment)

The reason this was sexist nonsense is because the original claim (women leaders better handled pandemic which was falsely claimed by a study then cited bu UN, WEF, Times, Guardian, BBC, etc) was:

1) Entirely false to being with

2) Due to Gamma Bias

# 1) entirely false to being with 

See here, not only did female leaders, but even higher female majority parliaments did worse:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/idz5ih/self\_according\_to\_european\_cdc\_and\_oxford/](https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/idz5ih/self_according_to_european_cdc_and_oxford/)

To be clear, to me with a brain THAT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN... there are countless factors, but it makes it even more hilarious those agenda drive fake researchers tried to say women did better, when they literally did worse.

The study saying otherwise was absurd in its logical gymnastics to try and paint a false picture: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ie5zng/fundamental\_analysis\_flaws\_underlying\_just\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ie5zng/fundamental_analysis_flaws_underlying_just_about/)

# 2) The reason: due to Gamma bias: 

[https://malepsychology.org.uk/2018/12/04/why-are-there-so-many-disagreements-about-gender-issues-its-usually-down-to-gamma-bias/](https://malepsychology.org.uk/2018/12/04/why-are-there-so-many-disagreements-about-gender-issues-its-usually-down-to-gamma-bias/)

Within the ‚Äúcelebration‚Äù cell, for example, the positive achievements of women are routinely celebrated as a gender issue. Within the same cell in the table, the positive actions and achievements of men are not similarly celebrated or gendered. For example, when a group of boys was recently rescued from dangerous underwater caves in Thailand, it was not reported as a gender issue or as a positive example of masculinity, despite the fact that all the rescuers were male.

In the ‚Äúvictimhood‚Äù cell, domestic violence against women, for example, is highlighted as a gender issue, whereas domestic violence against men is played down or completely ignored, despite the [substantial numbers of male victims](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-013-9194-1). When men make up the majority of victims (e.g. suicide, rough sleeping, deaths at work, addiction), the issues are not highlighted or portrayed as gender issues.

Within the ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù cell, male privileges are magnified in our media and politics as ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù whereas female privileges (for example relating to children and family life) are played down or ignored as gender issues.

The overall impact of gamma bias therefore, according to this hypothesis, is that masculinity is made to look significantly worse than it really is whilst simultaneously femininity is made to look significantly better than it really is.

What are the implications of the routine magnifying of the worst of men and minimising the worst of women? Well, for a start we might need to reconceptualise the ‚Äòcrisis of masculinity‚Äô as a crisis in our attitudes towards men and masculinity.

Let‚Äôs make 2019 the year we wake up to the need to explore our conscious and unconscious biases against men. We hope that the concept of gamma bias and the *gender distortion matrix* will help people to think more clearly about gender issues.",136,0

Edit: I should have added that in medical settings I think it is completely fine. In any matter pertaining to science/medicine/research is not a problem. This post is mostly about casual conversation and regular posts.

Edit 2: Happy New Year everyone! One last edit to clarify a bit more. This post is a rant. Plain and simple. I do not expect much to change after today, and no, I don't consider this the biggest issue on the list of world problems facing men Lol

I hope you all have a great, safe, and healthy 2021!",1,0

"Some sources on the sexual abuse of men and boys, part 4","**Studies demonstrating roughly gender parity in sexual assault victimisation**

[Sexual Aggression Victimization and Perpetration Among Female and Male University Students in Poland](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0886260515609583)

This is a 2015 study which examined the prevalence of victimisation and perpetration of sexual aggression since age 15 in a convenience sample of 565 Polish university students (356 females). While there was a larger gap in self-reported perpetration of sexual aggression, self-reported victimisation did not differ significantly by sex - the overall self-reported victimisation rate was 34.3% for females and 28.4% for males.

Broken down by coercive strategy, the highest victimisation rates were found for the use or threat of physical force (women: 23.1% and men: 20.5%), followed by the exploitation of their incapacitated state (17.6% and 11.7%). The victimisation rate was lowest for the use of verbal pressure (11.6% and 5.4%). Note that the victimisation rates for men and women when it comes to the forms of sexual aggression which involve force (experiencing unwanted sexual contact through use or threat of physical force and exploitation of incapacitated state) are virtually equal.

Their results regarding victimisation are broken down further in Table 2 by victim-perpetrator relationship and type of unwanted sexual contact. When one looks at gender differences at the item level, some interesting details reveal themselves.

A higher proportion of men than women reported unwanted sex from an (ex-)partner (10.8% and 6.8% respectively), a friend/acquaintance (9.8% and 4.3% respectively), and a stranger (6.9% and 1.4% respectively) through the threat or use of physical force. An equivalent or greater proportion of men than women also reported unwanted sex from an (ex-)partner (4.9% and 3.7% respectively), a friend/acquaintance (6.8% and 3.1% respectively) and a stranger (2.4% and 1.4% respectively) through the exploitation of their incapacitated state.

The present study examined sexual aggression victimisation and perpetration since the age of 15 in a convenience sample of 1,376 college students (886 women) from four public universities in Ankara, Turkey. Overall, 77.6% of women and 65.5% of men reported at least one instance of sexual aggression victimisation. ""With regard to the coercive strategies used by the perpetrator, the threat or use of physical force was the most commonly reported strategy, indicated by 73.8% of women and 62.1% of men, followed by the exploitation of the victim‚Äôs inability to resist, with 40.5% and 31.9%, respectively, and the use of verbal pressure, with 26.9% and 21.4%.""

[Violence and Sexual Coercion in High School Students' Dating Relationships](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007545302987)

The present study sought to investigate the extent of dating violence victimisation in a New Zealand sample of senior high school students and the perceived reasons for the violence, emotional effects, disclosure of the violence, and relationship consequences. Participants were 200 female and 173 male senior high school students aged 16 to 20 years (mean 16.7) who volunteered to take part in the study.

Students were asked about unwanted kissing, hugging, French kissing, genital contact (‚Äò‚Äòbeing felt up‚Äô‚Äô), and sex. Overall, 130 female students (76.9%) and 91 male students (67.4%) reported they had experienced one or more incidents of unwanted sexual activity. Similar numbers of male and female students reported most types of nonconsensual sexual activity; the exception was being felt up, which significantly more female than male students reported.

Students were given a list of 11 possible reasons for engaging in unwanted sex. Overall, perceived reasons for sexual coercion were similar for boys and girls. A substantial number of students reported having unwanted sex to show that they loved their partner (44.2% males, 34.7% females) or because they thought it was what the partners wanted (36.9% females, 35.6% males). Alcohol was also commonly reported as a reason for unwanted sexual activity. More than a quarter of each group (29.8% of males, and 26.9% of females) reported alcohol or drug use to be a main reason for the unwanted sexual activity. Significantly more male students reported having unwanted sexual activity because they thought their friends were doing it (21% males, 10.1% females). Relatively few students, male or female, reported fear of losing a partner, being held down (forced), being threatened with harm, or being hassled as reasons for unwanted sexual activity. Notably, almost as many males as females reported being held down and forced to have sex.

[National Baseline Study on Violence against Children: Philippines](https://www.unicef.org/philippines/reports/national-baseline-study-violence-against-children-philippines)

This study was the first ever national study on violence against children in the Philippines. Overall, 3,866 children and youth aged 13-24 years from 172 barangays in 17 regions of the country, participated in this survey. Among them, 1,979 were males and 1,887 were females.

The researchers sexual violence as ‚Äútaking photos or sex videos of being naked or engaging in sexual activities, unwanted touch, forced attempted sex, and forced consummated sex.‚Äù The first two include someone forcing the child to make the pictures or videos as well as the child doing it himself. 24.7 percent of males, compared with 18.2 percent of females, reported experiencing sexual violence.

About 3.2 percent of children and youth experienced the most severe form of sexual violence - forced consummated sex (anal, oral, and/or vaginal) during childhood. The prevalence for males was 4.1 percent, significantly higher than the 2.3 percent among females who experienced forced consummated sex.

[Sexual behavior and experience of sexual coercion among secondary school students in three states in North Eastern Nigeria](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-6-310)

This is a 2006 study exploring the reproductive health knowledge, sexual behavior and experience of sexual coercion among secondary school students in North Eastern states of Nigeria. Face-to-face interviews were conducted for 624 consenting students who were randomly selected from eighteen secondary schools using an 83-item structured questionnaire. Data was collected on demographic profile, reproductive health knowledge, sexual behavior and experience of sexual coercion. Behaviorally specific questions were used on coercion.

They asked respondents whether any of the following ever happened to them: whether ""someone touched your body against your will"", ""someone tricked you in order to have sex with you"", someone tried to force you to have sex"", ""someone forced you to have sex"", ""someone beat you for refusing to have sex with him/her"" ""someone gave you drugs in order to have sex with you"".

They found that more males than females reported being victims of sexual coercion. Table 5 shows the proportion of students who had experienced sexual coercion by gender.

||Male|Female|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Report any form of coercion|120 (37%)|104 (35%)|224 (36%)|
|Unwanted touch body|100 (31%)|93 (31%)|193 (31%)|
|Someone tried to force you to have sex|39 (12%)|30 (10%)|69 (11%)|

[Sexual Aggression among Brazilian College Students: Prevalence of Victimization and Perpetration in Men and Women](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232227972_Sexual_Aggression_among_Brazilian_College_Students_Prevalence_of_Victimization_and_Perpetration_in_Men_and_Women)

This research measured the prevalence of sexual aggression and victimization since age 14 among 742 first-year college students in Brazil (411 women). A Portuguese version of the Short Form of the Sexual Experiences Survey was administered to collect information from men and women as both victims and perpetrators of sexual aggression.

""Reports for the past 12 months and the period from age 14 up to 12 months ago were combined to yield an index of prevalence since age 14. The combined prevalence rate of victimization for the two time windows (past 12 months; since age 14 up to the past 12 months) was 27% among men and 29% among women across all aggressive strategies and sexual acts. In the total sample, verbal pressure was the most frequently reported aggressive strategy (19.3%), followed by exploitation of the victim‚Äôs inability to offer resistance (13.6%), and the threat or use of physical force (4.9%). Comparing men and women, the prevalence rates were, respectively, 16.4% and 22% for verbal coercion, 15.8% and 12% for exploitation of the victim‚Äôs incapacitated state, and 4.6% and 5.1% for threat or use of physical force. None of these rates differed significantly by gender.""

To obtain a nonredundant index of each participant‚Äôs victimisation and perpetration status, respondents were classified according to the most severe form of sexual victimisation they reported, using a scoring procedure proposed by Koss and colleagues:

1: Sexual contact (without penetration) through the use of verbal pressure, exploitation of victim‚Äôs intoxicated state, threat or use of physical force, but no attempted sexual coercion, sexual coercion, attempted rape, or completed rape.

2: Attempted sexual coercion, that is, attempted oral, vaginal, or anal penetration using verbal pressure, but no sexual coercion, attempted rape, or completed rape.

3: Sexual coercion, that is, completed oral, vaginal, or anal penetration using verbal pressure, but no attempted rape or completed rape.

4: Attempted rape, that is, attempted oral, vaginal, or anal penetration through exploitation of victim‚Äôs intoxicated state or threat or use of physical force, but no completed rape.

5: Completed rape, that is, completed oral, vaginal, or anal penetration through exploitation of victim‚Äôs intoxicated state or threat or use of physical force.

Because men had significantly more sexual partners than did women, this variable needed to be controlled to avoid a confound between gender and sexual activity. While they found that nonredundant victimisation rates were significantly higher among women for sexual coercion and attempted sexual coercion, even when controlling for number of partners, no significant gender differences were found for sexual contact and for the more severe forms of attempted rape and rape. 2.9% of women and 1.5% of men experienced attempted rape, and 5.1% of women and 5.8% of men experienced completed rape.

Among those men who reported at least one episode of victimization, 65% answered the item about sex of perpetrator. Of those, 72% were victimized only by women, 16% only by men, and 12% by both men and women. Among the female victims, 67% indicated the sex of the perpetrator. Of those, 96.3% were assaulted only by men, 1.2% only by women, and 2.5% by both sexes.

However, this study found a larger gender gap in perpetration, with far more males having reported perpetration than females.

[Experience of sexual coercion and risky sexual behavior among Ugandan university students](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-11-527)

In 2005, 980 (80%) out of a total of 1,220 students enrolled in Mbarara University of Science and Technology in Uganda participated in a self-administered questionnaire covering socio-demographic and religious factors, social capital, mental health, alcohol use, and sexual behaviour.

Experience of sexual coercion was based on a response of ""yes"" to any of the following questions: ""You have been *forced* to show your sexual organ"", ""Someone has *forced* you to let them touch your sexual organ"", ""Someone *forced* you to let them suck or lick your sexual organ"", ""Someone has *forced* you to let them show you their own sexual organ"", ""You have been *forced* to watch someone masturbate"", ""You have been *forced* to masturbate someone"", ""You have been *forced* to take part in oral sex or to lick someone's sexual organ"", ""You have been *forced* to take part in sexual intercourse with the penis in the vagina, or someone has inserted an object into your vagina"", or ""You have been *forced* to pose for a sex photo or sex film"". In the absence of any affirmative answer to the above questions, and with an affirmative answer to the question ""You have not been *forced* into any of these"", the individual was classified as unexposed to sexual coercion.

The reported prevalence was very similar between the sexes: 33.1% for females and 29.9% for males.

""Occurrence of male child rape \[in South Africa:\] Weighted by province and urban/rural areas, 9% (based on 13915/127097) reported forced sex without consent in the last year. In answer to a separate question, 44% of 18 year-olds said they had ""ever"" been forced to have sex (weighted value of 5385/11450).""

""In response to the question about the sex of the perpetrator, 32% of those who answered (7755/23889) said the perpetrator was male, 41% (weighted value for 9879/23889) said she was female and 26% (6255/23889) said they had been forced to have sex by both male and female perpetrators. Male abuse of schoolboys was much more common in rural areas while female perpetration was more an urban phenomenon.""

""Male schoolchildren in South Africa suffer high rates of sexual abuse, many of the assaults perpetrated in school. By the age of 18 years, two in every five schoolboys reported being forced to have sex, mostly by female perpetrators.""

""This study was a cross-section of children present at sample schools during a single field visit. The anonymous, facilitated self-administered questionnaire prevented registering class members not present at the time of the visit, and no effort was made to contact those who were not present as this would make them identifiable as individuals. It seems reasonable to assume that, if anything, the survey underestimated sexual violence among schoolboys.""

**Commercial sexual exploitation of boys**

[The Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in New York City](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/225082.pdf)

This is a study conducted by John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan on youths working as prostitutes in NYC. When the researchers put out a call for commercially sexually exploited children (CSEC), they ended up with far more boys than they expected. The boys ended up outnumbering the girls to such a degree that the researchers stopped accepting boys and tried to gather more girls who were being pimped.

Yet despite this effort, the researchers still found that almost half of the victims of CSEC were boys. Of the 249 children they included in the study, 119 were girls, 111 were boys, and 19 were transgender. Those results debunk the idea that only or mostly girls are prostitutes.

The researchers reported their own surprise at the large number of boys who showed up to be interviewed for their ‚Äúself-reporting‚Äù study, which was not looking for gender differences. Even though boys had been previously mentioned by some policy makers, practitioners and researchers, this study did not focus on them as a significant segment of the market or on their unique sets of problems. The report said: ‚ÄúWhile we might argue about the relative proportion of boys versus girls in the sex market, there can be little doubt that boys are far more numerous‚Ä¶than is commonly acknowledged. Policy makers and practitioners who are concerned about the growth of CSEC markets need to account for and respond to all of the youth that are swept into it, yet there is scant discussion about boys, and no services for them at all.""

[Sexual Assault, Overweight, and Suicide Attempts in U.S. Adolescents](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sltb.12148)

The study analyzed data from a Youth and Risk Behavior Survey that sampled more than 31,000 teenagers in 2009 and 2011. The research continued a preliminary study from 2011 that found similar results using a smaller sample of teens. The poll surveyed students ages 14 to 18 and examined whether the two variables influenced suicide attempts within a year of the survey.

What they found was that 3.5 percent of healthy-weight males with no sexual assault history attempted suicide. That percentage climbed to 33.2 percent for healthy-weight males with sexual assault history, which Anderson attributes to stigma, shame, possible gender role conflict if the attacker was male and the lack of an open support system. Weight alone was not a significant factor in suicide attempts for males. Only 3.9 percent of overweight males with no sexual assault history attempted suicide. For males who were both overweight and had a history of sexual assault, the percentage who attempted suicide was 33 percent.

In contrast, 5.8 percent of healthy-weight females with no sexual assault history attempted suicide. The percentage rose to 27.1 percent for healthy-weight girls with a history of sexual assault. Weight influenced the suicide rate among women: 8.2 percent of overweight girls with no sexual assault history attempt suicide. However, both factors did not increase suicide rate: 26.6 percent of overweight girls with sexual assault histories attempted suicide.

**Men are less likely to view to acknowledge their experiences of sexual assault and are less likely to report it, which likely affects data and statistics on the topic.**

""Across the United Kingdom (UK) there has been a steady increase in the number of males who feel confident enough to report their experiences to the police. However, research conducted by SurvivorsUK has suggested that the percentage of men who actually report their experiences is as low as 3.9 per cent.""

""In 2013 a joint piece of work by the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Office for National Statistics suggested that around 20 per cent of victims don‚Äôt report incidents of sexual assault and rape to the police. However, these estimates were developed using data on reporting habits collected only from women. This does though show that there is a clear acknowledgement that a large number of victims decide never to inform the police of their experiences.""

""Figures collected from all the UK‚Äôs police forces show that between 2010 and 2014 there were 26,483 recorded incidents of males being victims of sexual assault or rape. This includes 3,748 incidents recorded by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) ‚Äì the highest rate in the UK.""

""Using these figures alongside the research conducted by SurvivorsUK, we can estimate the number of males over the age of 16 who were sexually assaulted or raped between 2010 and 2014, who did not report their experiences to the police.""

""These numbers suggest that across the entire UK between 2010 and 2014, 679,051 sexual assaults and rapes of males took place. Of these ‚Äì 652,568 were not reported to any police force.""

""In the geographical area covered by the MPS this would equate to 96,103 sexual assaults and rapes of males between 2010 and 2014 ‚Äì with 92,355 of them not being reported.""

[Police Perceptions of Rape as Function of Victim Gender and Sexuality](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1350/pojo.2009.82.1.466)

In this study one hundred and twenty-eight United Kingdom police workers of various ranks read a hypothetical rape scenario in which victim gender and victim sexuality were experimentally manipulated before completing a 12-item rape attributions questionnaire focusing on perceptions of victim blame and assault severity. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) were then performed. Overall, police workers were largely pro-victim although, as expected, they were more negative towards male victims than female victims. Contrary to expectations, these trends existed regardless of victim sexuality.

How many braincels do these people have?,"Feminists will treat men like some sort of priviledged group that has hegemony over literally anything else, and proceed to blame their entire problems on the ""Patriarchy"", an unknown entity that forces women to be more oppresed than the Armenians in 1916. 

However, they are quick to blame this mysterious force for all of men's problems (Look at r/FragileMaleRedditor, for example, and look for when they can't disscuss something and start summoning this force as the culprit) even though the word itself says this is impossible.

For starters ""patriarchy"" comes from the words Patria and Archy, the first meaning ""Fatherland"" in this case used simply as ""Father"", and the second means ""To rule"". Basically, you could say ""Patriarchy"" means ""Father to rule"" thus implying ""Fathers"" or in this case men in general have a total  paramountcy hover society.

And so, how the sacred fuck does this hypotetical force manage to turn on it's conjurers and somehow cause them to be called gay for wearing a little bit of pink in their shirts? How and why does this esse somehow and magically make men way more likely to kill themselves, if it in theory just makes men live like kings?

Arguing with a coffee shop feminist on reddit with no power and likely no even real yniderstanding of feminism is"" HIGH effort, LOW yield result"" work.... a 10 minute letter to a company, organisation, school or whatever maybe correcting a journalist on false stats etc is low/moderate effort higher yield... also the positive effect you get when you send a letter and get a reply (and you usually do get a good reply, dont listen to negativity here) reinforces you to do it again.... then post your letter here, which encourages others... see 10x better use of your time than debating Brenda the coffee shop feminist on reddit. I admit I post a lot, but im doing it on breaks and I do enjoy it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also remember when you debate, you are debating for the audience NOT the radical (who is unlikely to change their mind).... thats why be polite, dont lose it, and it doesnt matter if they dont agree, you are arguing for the moderates who will see your argument laid out..... this how people are red pilled

But as I said, dont waste your time doing it, no point!!

# Here Is The Copy and Paste Post: 

Of course women have MANY issues in healthcare and many cases of being let down. As do men. The narrative of \*specifically\* female ""oppression"" or ""systemic neglect"" in way not experienced by others however is a false narrative\*\* Again no one is saying there aren''t issues but the overriding narrative is false. What causes this flawed view? See the last link in this post for why. But first:

**Women not treated as seriously by drs?**

Again huge feminsit talking point and myth:

&gt;Emily Dwass‚Äô opinion piece repeats the charge that female patients‚Äô complaints are ignored by doctors because of their gender.Her impression is not supported by research into this issue. A large nationwide review, which examined 46,868 office visits, revealed that the care received by men and women was similar about two-thirds of the time. When the care was different, women overall received more diagnostic tests and treatment ‚Äî more lab tests, blood-pressure checks, drug prescriptions, and return appointments.In the United States, we spend twice as much on the healthcare of women than on that of men. Even if you exclude obstetrical care, females at every age receive more medical attention than males. The charge that the healthcare of women is neglected because of their gender needs to be evaluated in that context.*Andrew G. Kadar, M.D., Beverly Hills*

"Most participants thought the term toxic masculinity insulting, probably harmful to boys, and unlikely to help men's behaviour. Most participants said they would be unhappy if their masculinity or femininity were blamed for their work or relationship problems.",,24,0
"According to the The Palgrave Handbook of Male Psychology and Mental Health , the word toxic masculinity has no clinical value and is an example of another cognitive distortion called negative labelling usually have a negative impact such as alienation of affected groups."," 

Plus most men percieve it as something offensive. Although 'semantically' its correct, it is not helpful. Even the word 'negro' was used to refer to black african people but ultimately became offensive.

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341832524\_Reactions\_to\_contemporary\_narratives\_about\_masculinity\_A\_pilot\_study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341832524_Reactions_to_contemporary_narratives_about_masculinity_A_pilot_study)

This study did a survey in which about 80% men found the word toxic masculinity as not helpful.

Why should we use a word which is not seen as helpful and seen as offensive? It feels like its okay to be sexist against men. Another example is of the word 'retarded' which semantally was a normal word but got banned.

'Since the word has become commonly used in informal speech, it is harder to see the connection between the original word meaning and the current informal use of the word. For this reason, it may be difficult to understand why the word is still considered offensive. The definition of the word retarded, according to Merriam-Webster dictionary is ‚ÄúOffensive: slow or limited in intellectual or emotional development‚Äù. At one point in time ‚Äúmental retardation‚Äù was a medical term used to describe a person with an intellectual disability. However, since then the word has been replaced by the term ‚Äúintellectual disability‚Äù because it is more accurate and accepting. The r-word is an exclusive term that furthers negative stereotypes about people with disabilities. It can be hurtful whether it is directed towards a person with a disability or when used as a synonym for ‚Äúdumb‚Äù or ‚Äústupid‚Äù. When used in this way it is equivalent to saying people with disabilities are stupid. In addition, the real message of the sentence is lost because the r-word has a completely different meaning than the words ‚Äústupid‚Äù or ‚Äúdumb‚Äù. There are many other words to choose from instead of the r-word that will better represent the intended meaning.'",1,0
Is this sub about hating women or just the unfair advantages extreme feminism has introduced into modern society?,"It‚Äôs pretty fair to say that for most of history, patriarchal values have placed women as second rate within most societies. Traditional gender roles, women not able to own property, right to vote, wage gaps. I know a lot of those things no longer apply in modern times but other forms of discrimination and disadvantages exist for women (victim shaming, abortion/birth control rights, wage gap still, sexual assault/harassment). Yes I know that men are also subject to many of these things but that does not diminish what women face, and vice versa. None of it is fair for anyone, and one side facing any obstacles does not make it justifiable or less significant for the other. My point being that women are fighting for change to balance the scales that have been against them for so long. My question is if this sub has become a place to attempt to keep women in their place and upholding one unfair status quo by labeling feminist activism as the opposite end of the spectrum. So are you all here advocating for equal fairness, or not? 

Browsing through this sub, I see some posts and perspectives that I can agree with. I don‚Äôt personally think women should be given the upper hand and advantage in all facets of society over men. I can agree that extreme feminism has mutated into something just as bad, just for their side/benefit and to me that is wrong. Society should be equally balanced end story. What troubles me about this sub are the posts that have become so inflamed at the idea of a woman even coming close to equal status of a man that it‚Äôs not a matter of equality but the evil workings of extreme, unreasonable feminism at play.",8,0

My opinions on feminism/men‚Äôs rights etc;,"(This post is just me ranting or gathering my thoughts tbh)

In regards to the men‚Äôs rights movement, I believe that too many members of r/mensrights are anti-women and this makes them just as bad as women, they are like the reverse of feminism, ‚Äòequal but opposite‚Äô is the best way to describe it. They hunt for any reason to attack feminism or more dangerously women as a whole

However, in regards to feminism, I believe that feminists live in ignorance. Oblivious to the fact that men can be oppressed too. Their idea is that all oppression against men can be ‚Äòdebunked‚Äô by the fact that women were oppressed much more so than men in previous generations. This idea stays with feminsm today, that women are still ‚Äòmore oppressed‚Äô than men.
This myth can very easily be debunked too though, it is the idea that one oppression cancels out another. If someone tells you that it‚Äôs impossible to be sexist to men, ask them
‚ÄúWere Jews oppressed when nazi Germany killed them in their millions simply for their religion?‚Äù
The answer will most likely be yes
‚ÄúBut what about the Jews in Israel who are persecuting the Palestinians for being Muslim? Who is oppressed there?‚Äù
‚ÄúBut what about the Muslims in Saudi Arabia who are persecuting African migrants in ‚Äòcovid detention centres?‚Äô
(This should dispel any beliefs of one oppression cancelling another out, relying on the fact that the person has listened and is not in the process of tweeting about you right now)
Although risky, this is the best analogy I can think of

"Biologically engrained, I found the answer","A little long but easy to follow.

Women like men who can protect them (or have traits of that), and want to mate them. 
They have the best chance of survival with the more powerful males.

Men want to mate with the best partner they can find for the best chance at surviving their offspring, so they do whatever the partners find most valuable which is being strong, protective, and risk dying for them. 

This is engrained biologically, because biologically we want to reproduce as a species or any species for that matter. Otherwise they would cease to exist and humans are quite successful as a species.

Therefore:
Men are more powerful (thus leaders), they protect more (thus risk their lives for their mate/children), etc.

Men are engrained to protect the women, because they think it will bring sex to pass offspring.

But women as a whole don't biologically (subconsciously) care about ""protection"" by supporting feminism, they subconsciously want the man that will best give them the best chance of survival, a man with powerful features.

And when women cannot find a partner that can give them this protection, they rely on the collective whole to protect them, hence feminism.

Fear is pushed, and any men that don't like feminism, don't want to protect women. 
There is a collective ""need"" for feminism to pass on children.

Incels offer no biological reasoning to mate for offspring and there is no collective reasons for the survival of the species.
They are hated the worst.

Male feminists offer a collective need to keep them, but no biological desire in a woman's eyes.
They are friends but not mates for offspring.

Men who go off dying or risking their lives for their partner and family that they have, dont care as much about feminism.

Women who have a partner willing to die for them, or partner with power, care about feminism to an extent, their partner can't protect them 24/7. 

Women who deeply care about feminism, fight it so hard because they know they won't be able to find a partner to protect them, they require the collective whole (feminism) to protect them.",1,0

On Gratitude,"From time to time we get posts from people who are desperately depressed because of the seeming impossibility of getting a fair deal for men, because they have been divorce raped, because they have been falsely accused or for some other reason.


Of all the spiritual practices which might help the one with the highest reward/effort ratio is probably the practice of gratitude.


It is a simple practice to get into the habit of, and there are many ways to do it. In days gone by, people used to express gratitude for food before eating, but this has fallen by the wayside along with belief in God. Nonetheless, taking time to appreciate things is a worthwhile activity.


You can do it by deliberately thinking of something or several things to be grateful for at the end of the day. For a while our family kept a jar of notes that we would add to each time there was something special worth remembering. From time to time we would open it and read them. This had the added bonus of reminding us to do things we had enjoyed before.


As a trainer on a back to work scheme, I used to get the group to come up with something at the beginning of each day. While I couldn‚Äôt measure it, I am sure that this made the whole programme much more positive. (These courses tend to be a bit negative since the participants are compelled to attend on pain of losing their benefits.)


What I also found was that many of them could not come up with anything, although I could fire of half a dozen things for them (living in Australia, being in good health, free Internet in the library, benefits while not working,  etc.) After a while, most people got the hang of it and started recognizing the good things in their lives without taking them for granted.

It is an easy habit to get into and one which, if practiced habitually will tend to guard against depression and increase happiness. It being New Year's now might be a good time to start this habit.

Edit: while on the subject of New Year's resolutions, if you resolve to give up smoking, people will come up to you at five past midnight and casually offer you a cigarette. So every year, I resolve to give up oral intercourse. This may not work for everyone.

Bothered by how normalized male circumcision is AKA genital mutilation,"I've never realized how normalized male circumcision is which is just another form of genital mutilation. FYI I'm circumcised but not for the reason you may think and it was medically necessary in fact I'm pretty sure I'm the only male in the family that is circumcised lol. Back to the topic however I am just starting to realizing how normalized even glorified male circumcision is. Something that is permanent and essentially conformed on infants without consent. 

I know this is a shitty example but I was scrolling through the hub today and saw this comment here it is word for word, "" **Wow girl you are lucky... Your man is circumcised so tight the remaining skin on his shaft cant even be pulled up into the same zip code as the base of his glans. Does it turn you on to know that your mans cock was permanently altered to the extreme, the head of his dick removed from its protective sheath and significantly desensitized by 24/7 exposure to friction all for your enjoyment. And the icing on the cake his frenulum, the male g spot, 100% carved out. I bet he can fuck for hours**."" I know that this is a shitty example but reading this just made me sick to my stomach and it the very first time I viewed a circumcised cock in disgust in fact I've lost my appetite just by reading this. I have a link but I don't want to post it unless you guys actually want me to prove it and it's not a gore video btw. This is just one of many different ways I've seen how circumcision is normalized but even glorified. 

Even though I'm circumcised I never really thought of it much and I never really viewed it as necessary but after reading this comment it only reaffirmed it more. If I do have a son in the future I will make sure that he does not get circumcised unless it is actually medically necessary but even then I will try to find potential alternatives if possible. I know that this is a dumb comment from a random video on a porn website but it shows just how menial it seems to many people in society. I know many women as well as men that support this practice and it's just disheartening. The good news is that circumcision rates are declining in the U.S and many parts of the world(except in certain areas due to culture/religion) but the way circumcision is brushed over makes me quite sad and angry.",19,0
Road of Bones: A hidden gendercide,"[A road in Siberia](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/11/16/russian-town-dusts-highway-with-human-bones-a72055) , known as the [road of death](https://archive.org/details/KolymaUncut), that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives of prisoners to build. I suspect they were totally or primarily male deaths. Anyone know any gender information on this?

&amp;#x200B;

I've found a couple of quotes more generally that might imply males in heavier work, and I'm aware some females were sent to forestry and mining.  

""As a rule, men were separated from their families and sent to do hard labor. Women, children, and the elderly were left without means for survival. Terrible conditions, hunger, and hard labor caused high mortality, particularly among children."" (Khlevniuk 2004)

""Perhaps because of the camp commanders‚Äô objections, the numbers of women who were actually sent to camps always remained relatively low (as did the number of women executed during the 1937‚Äì38 purge). According to the official statistics, for example, only about 13 percent of Gulag prisoners in the year 1942 were women. This went up to 30 percent in 1945, due in part to the enormous number of male prisoners drafted and sent to the front, and also to the laws forbidding workers to leave their factory‚Äîlaws which led to the arrest of many young women.8 In 1948 it was 22 percent, falling again to 17 percent in 1951 and 1952.9 Still, even these numbers fail to reflect the true situation, as women were far more likely to be assigned to serve their sentences in the light-regime ‚Äúcolonies.‚Äù In the large, industrial camps of the far north, they were even fewer, their presence even rarer.""

Youtube: Misandry at the UN and WHO - Regarding Men: and the UN's World Toilet Day,"Yesterday someone posted a link to this video...

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5tZyiQeNzw
* **Misandry at the UN and WHO - Regarding Men**

It's well worth the watch. For some reason the OP deleted the post.

In it we have a guest speaker, James Nuzzo posting evidence of how the UN is sexist against men. In one segment he lists the special days recognized by the UN, and one them was *International Women's Day*. Warren Farrel mentions *International Men's Day* (neither created by or recognized by the UN) and James Nuzzo mentions that the UN does recognize something on Nov 19 (IMD), and that's *World Toilet Day*. Warren Farrel mentioned that he once tried to look up whether they came up with *World Toilet Day* after IMD was created, as an insult to IMD. So I decided to look it up.

When was IMD started?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Men%27s_Day

* **History**

* **Inaugurated in 1992 on 7 February** by Thomas Oaster,[4] the project of International Men's Day was conceived one year earlier on 8 February 1991.[5] The project was re-initialised in 1999 in Trinidad and Tobago.[6] The longest running celebration of International Men's Day is Malta, where events have occurred since 7 February 1994.[7] Now as Malta was the only country that observed the February date of celebrating Men and their contribution to the society, the Maltese AMR Committee voted in 2009 to shift the date for IMD to 19th November.[8]

* Jerome Teelucksingh, who revived the event, chose 19 November to honour his father's birthday and also to celebrate how on that date in 1989 Trinidad and Tobago's football team had united the country with their endeavours to qualify for the World Cup.[9][10] Teelucksingh has promoted International Men's Day as not just a gendered day but a day where all issues affecting men and boys can be addressed. He has said of IMD and its grass roots activists, ""They are striving for gender equality and patiently attempt to remove the negative images and the stigma associated with men in our society"".[11] 

When did the UN come up with *World Toilet Day*?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Toilet_Day

* Observed by:	worldwide
* Date:	19 November
* Frequency:	annual
* First time:	19 November 2001 (unofficially) and 19 November 2012 (as an official UN Day)
* Related to:	UN-Water (convener), World Toilet Organization (initiator)

So the UN came up with WTD in 2001, 9 years after WMD was inaugurated.

I think that spells out pretty clearly what the UN thinks of WMD.

The Wikipedia article lists why WTD is so important.

* Toilets are important because access to a safe functioning toilet has a positive impact on public health, human dignity, and personal safety, **especially for women**.",8,0

Child Support/Alienation advice,"So without diving too deep and personal and disclosing the novel which is my life story ..I'm gunna  try to keep it simple.

I have been alienated from my children for almost 10yrs now. I've done the best I could to keep going and move on with my life with the hope that one day it will be made right. I've suffered so much over the years. Not just from crippling depression and trauma from being helplessly ripped out of my children's life, but also financial ruin. Child support has made it impossible for me to get anywhere in life. I've been homeless multiple times because of it...Lost jobs because of it... vehicles...my license...even been jailed for falling behind.

I just found out through a friend, who did some social media snooping for me, that my ex (the baby momma) has just bought a house. A nice one too. It's big, 3 car garage, large in-ground pool, 2 kitchens, nice suburban neighborhood, you get the point. 

Obviously my ex has come into a large amount of money. From what I have been able to see on casenet, she been battling in civil court for the past several years. But I can't find out the outcome or details because it doesn't disclose that info, plus apparently it was sent to federal court. But my hypothesis is she won a large settlement.

Meanwhile here I am...poor af, living in squallor, well below poverty level. They garnish at least 60% of my pay. Tax returns, stimulus check, all intercepted. I am constantly facing eviction and utility shut offs because I just can't make enough to survive, much less get ahead or save up. I walk over a mile to work in rain, snow, cold, and heat because they suspended my license, not that I can afford to even own a car anyway. Every day is a struggle...and there's no end in sight. I try very hard to stay strong, to be humble and thankful. Some days are better than others obviously, but overall I been pretty good about not letting things get to me so much and making the best of what I have.

I'm not even jealous. Obviously, like it would be to anyone else, it is kinda a blow to the gut. Feels completely unfair. But life is not fair. But honestly, I am glad to know that my kids are well provided for and getting to live the good life. 

So what I am wondering is whether this could affect the child support amount? I can't afford to even get on my feet, and she just bought a huge house (well over $500k). All I have wanted and been trying to do is build a life, one that is stable, one that I could have my kids in again. But I struggle to just keep my electric on and food in the fridge.

 Is there something I should do? Or can do even? Is it even worth it? I can't afford a lawyer. But anyone out there got any advice or suggestions? Thank you for reading.",7,0
We need to make our 36th birthdays a cause for celebration. (to raise awareness),"In the US the maximum age of conscription is 35. This means that when you turn 36 you are home free from being sent to foreign lands to get your guts blown out. I feel like bringing attention (by celebration) to this important milestone could raise some awareness of how fucked up the whole thing is. 

I'm in Canada and here it is 45 years old. I'm 6 months away from having this potential burden lifted from my mind. I was 7 years old when on remembrance day my mother told me about how awful war was. My first question was ""Why would any man choose to go to war?"" Her response was that they have no choice because they are conscripted by force. She also told me that most/many generations of young men had been made to go through this and there was a chance this could apply to me when I was grown up.  I said I would refuse. She informed me of the consequences to which I replied ""I will hide"". I can't remember how the rest of the convo went but I remember being scared (I was 7 and yes it was borderline abuse on her part to tell me these things at that age but my mom was a straight shooter). Throughout my life any time a conflict would start arising I remember thinking ""Is this the one?"" 

This age milestone is important and needs to be made into a big deal. IMO",21,0

To the young men here: develop a strong frame,"I'm seeing a lot of sentiment on this sub lately that reads like this: ""I feel hated for being a man, I feel lesser for being a man, I feel sub-human for any reason whatsoever"" 

I wanted to take a moment and address this type of thinking for all you young and impressionable guys on this sub. 

Firstly this is a mental health issue, not a men's right's issue. YOUR personal worldview is YOUR responsibility. 

- Internet algorithms are going to feed you crap that triggers you or keeps your eyeballs on the page, NOT the truth

- What you hear on the news or on reddit is typically extremism

- No one is going to hold your hand and remind you of the above, so begin to practice healthy skepticism of everything you read on reddit

I advocate all men here, especially young men, to become aware and cultivate your frame.

Do you live in a warm, friendly universe? A place where strangers are rooting for your success? 

Or do you live in a dark place where all women and the media and public and reddit are all rooting for your demise, simply because you are a man?

Decide what you think the truth is, question it to see if it holds up from different angles, and then stick to it despite what headlines tell you.

For example, ""kill all men"" and the idea that women hate men is toxic. We can debate whether 20% of women believe this or 80% do. So what about the other group? That group of silent women you never read about, who sympathetically understand the struggle of men and want us to have equal rights? You don't see them because you don't look for them, because our mind sees only what we look for.

Your frame is a *choice*. Either your subconscious runs it (99% of men) or you take charge and decide what it is (1% of men).

Take charge and start focusing on the various groups of women and men out there who want you to succeed, and FEEL EMPOWERED to tackle the struggles that we face as men.",12,0

I feel like people hate me for being born male,"I just wanted to get this out. It's not going to be well written.

Just everywhere I go men are shamed. Faggot, virgin, loser, coomer, beta, cuck, small dick, gay, etc. Even among conservative women they go on about how there are so few real men anymore. 

I don't know how to act around women. There is like a million different influences. The older generation says I should be a ""gentleman"". MRA's say I should be *masculine*. Feminists want me to be *feminine*. I'm scared to be myself 

My very existence is problematic apparently. I don't feel like I have a place here. My views are also considered radical and dangerous.

I see schools implementing routines to teach young boys not to be rapists. I genuinely wonder how long it'll be until they start neutering us at birth or something because I'm a disease. 

Any man who expresses disapproval of this stuff in academia is being fired. I keep trying to actually talk to feminists but they aren't receptive to my concerns

"""Women Needed a Magazine that Doesn‚Äôt Lie to Them. So I Started One"" - Anti feminist magazine for women anti man bashing etc.","Article about it:

[https://quillette.com/2019/02/20/women-needed-a-magazine-that-doesnt-lie-to-them-so-i-started-one/](https://quillette.com/2019/02/20/women-needed-a-magazine-that-doesnt-lie-to-them-so-i-started-one/)

The magazine is here:

[https://www.eviemagazine.com/](https://www.eviemagazine.com/)

On search bar search men, masculinity, feminism etc. Some very good anti feminist articles. 

Basically it's anti feminist online magazine for women about beauty and womens stuff mainly. Great anti feminist and pro masculine articles and goes very very much against man bashing and anti male feminists rhetoric currently. Obouvlsy its a magazine so will have some articles you agree and some you don't, and some that are very middle feminsit (well not really, feminists wouldnt like the articles). My point is that its a step in right direction, as anti feminist, pro masculine stuff is more mainstream, making it reach another audience....here women.  those women reading the magazine would never read MRA content, so by seeing this at least they can see some anti-feminist narrative content and would otherwise normally see loads of feminist content men bad bull shit

Some people worry about this kind or approach by women as they see it as trad con stuff... most articles on feminism and masculinity I dont think are in that category. Maybe a few here and there are. Personally I am not too bothered by tradcon stuff too, we have mutual interests.",12,0
"Saw a ""The Future is Female"" shirt today. I am really amazed anyone considers this equality as oppose to supremacy.","I saw someone wearing a ""The Future is Female"" today. I find it truly amazing we can see this is as part of an equality movement, it seems rather obvious to me telling a specific group of people they have no share of the future is supremacy.

To quickly break it down, by definition, it says ""the future"", meaning there is a single future. ""is female"" means it belongs specifically to those who are female. By definition, it means it does not belong to those who are not female--meaning they think we have no share in the future.

I think it is a testament to what people will believe if it is simply repeated loudly enough with enough done to try to silence those who disagree.",13,0
Can we start using the term fake feminist for people who are out to seek anti-equality against men?,"1. There are real feminists who are fighting for real issues all over the world, they deserve the right to be acknowledged. Being anti feminism looks like you are against real feminists too. Similarly when women have to mention ""well, not all men."" I think they deserve the right considering they are being beaten and imprisoned for basic human rights.
We need to stand with women who want basic human rights. 

2. The image that is given to majority of the nation is: anti-feminism = anti-equality. Even if most US feminists are looking to get a step up, it sets a negative tone and automatically lures people away.

I prefer to call them fake feminists because the goal is not equality and it doesn't diminish the few who want equality. 

I think this will progress MRAs and their image.

Do we want to be heard? Then we need to stop making blanket statements against all feminists.

Do we want to be isolated? Then we can keep  making MRAs have a negative public image.",90,0

Question for Fathers.,"So my wife is pregnant with our first child. We decided we wanted to wait to find out the gender so we won't know till they're born. Everyone in my family and her family think it's a boy and my wife now thinks it's a boy.

So now that she's 33 weeks pregnant and the closer we're getting I've been thinking (maybe overthinking) on what I'll need to do for my child.

With everything going on, how girls and boys are addressed and treated differently in society. Am I worrying over nothing if I have a boy? Because if I do. When they're old enough I feel like I need to ensure they know it's okay to feel emotion, teach them how to protect themselves when alone with a female to ensure they're not falsely accused of something, etc.

And for people who are fathers of boys is it true that boys are essentially being told not to be rapists and abusers by teachers?

I just want to set up my child (regardless of gender) to be successful in life. But it seems harder if I had a son. If my rambling makes sense.",21,0

"This sub is making me depressive, why should I get involved into any of this?","So the feminism we have seem lately is very depressing for me, I rarely get affected by it in real life, the people I meet in person are usually ""normal"" and I don't see as much hate for men as I see on the internet. Of curse there are tons of social justice warriors at work and stuff but I can chose just not to interact with this people. 

I feel that I'm becoming a kind of feminist from the other side, in real life I don't have that many consequences but I'm getting scared of women just because of all I read online. Just like women that are worried of men because of everything, even though it is very unlikely they will get rapped or whatever. I'm scared of being falsely accused of rape, of being manipulated into impregnating someone, of being financially slaved and so on. Rationally I think this is silly, because I think that it is very unlikely to happen but I'm still irrationally scared. 

Lately I lost the interest of dating at all, it got to my mind that I'm just seen as a ""potential rapist"" and I feel like just retreating from any kind of relationship with women, I don't want to deal with this, why would I want to have anything to do with someone that is afraid of me? The times I do interact with women for dating I try to be as passive as possible to try to not show any kind of aggression, I won't disagree with anything and just support the lady in any non sense she says - this is very boring for me and it makes me lose interest very fast. And this is getting worse the more I get into this world of men x women.

That is why I'm thinking that getting into any kind of men's right activism is fucking my mind the same way feminism is fucking the minds of many women. I'm thinking just retreating myself from all of this to try to go back to normal.

What do you think about this? Don't you feel feel affected the same way? How different is mra from feminism in this aspect ?",35,0

The police lied and told him that if he turned himself in, they wouldn't take him to jail where he ended up spending a month, and now he can barley get a job anywhere. Only got this one because he's friends with the manager who kindly ignored the background test. Sure, I've learned #1 rule is NEVER TALK TO THE POLICE WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY, so if he never had said anything, who knows? Maybe he would have a clean record right now.. But anyways, it just infuriates me that he's now on the sex offender registry, spent a month in jail due to a $10k bond even after he turned himself in and cooperated with the police, and it was a non-violent crime! I got a DUI, underage consumption charge, underage possession charge, and possession of marijuana charge, and walked out with a free/no cost bail the same night. Being a DUI, I was putting not only my LIFE but others LIVES at risk driving drunk and high! Is that not worse than sending or asking for nudes?? Not long after that I was arrested for public intoxication, and resisting arrest after having to be recuffed 3 times, screaming and fighting with the police, and bashing my head into the police car repetitively, and that was only a $1k bail so I was out the next day. So our ""justice"" system is going to let violent, insane druggies/alcoholics like me back out on the streets for free, or only $1k bond, but they're going to lock a dude up for a month with a $10k bond just for asking for or sending nudes to a chick who never even mentioned her age, and was flirting with him?!

How do we get equal reproductive access for men?,"Right now women can easily reproduce asexually. Just walk into a spermbank. Or get a one night stand. Now of course getting laid is super easy for a women but a challenge for men thanks to a rigged dating dynamics. But aside from that the man has no choice on keeping the kid. People here love talking about paper abortion but let's talk about the other side. That men do not have equal reproductive access. 

I propose that abortion should be a double approve policy. If either Father or Mother oppose the kid cannot be aborted. Further, there needs to be a way so that Men can get a kid without having to go through the dating dynamics. A sperm bank but in reverse. The fact that women have 100% reproductive control is a key reason dating is rigged in favour of women. They control all the cards. Men need Women to reproduce but women do not need Men. 

As a man, I should be able to reproduce as easily as a woman could. I should also be able to marry up and be asked out and catered to the way women are but that is a different discussion. Hopefully one day Men would truly get treated equal to Women instead of being treated  as the second class humans we are right now?",23,0

The first person to be vaccinated is always a woman,"Over the past few weeks this has caught my attention  as the COVID vaccine has been rolled out in more and more countries. Truth be told, I can't say it's something I didn't see coming but to actually see it play out just as I predicted is a little surreal.

First, a little background. As a young and healthy individual, I am in no rush at this point to get the vaccine--if anything, I am somewhat reluctant. If I were an older nursing home resident, I would likely be more willing, but even then it wouldn't matter to me if I were the first person in my country, or even the first person in the home, to be vaccinated so long as I could receive the vaccine as soon as possible if that were my intent.

However, as I alluded earlier, since the beginning of December, the vaccine has been introduced in more and more countries, states, provinces, etc. The media always make a big deal of showing the first person to obtain the vaccine--and that person is always a woman. Granted, the high-risk populations being prioritized for vaccine are predominantly female--most nurses are women, and far fewer men than women survive into their 90s and 100s, but even so if the participants had been truly selected randomly, you would at least expect a minority of men as the first participants, but instead you only see women. Why is that? I think we all know the answer, and that answer is incredibly relevant to understanding our current cultural zeitgeist.

In short, health authorities and governments are deliberately ensuring that the first shot is administered to a woman to avoid ensuing the anger of feminists and their powerful allies. They know that if a woman receives the first vaccine, nobody will protest, but if the first shot were to be administered to a man, this would lead to widespread anger and condemnation from feminists who would accuse the governments of being sexist or misogynistic, and are trying to avoid this label. I can't really blame them either, given the powerful allies that the radical feminist movement has that gives it a disproportionately large platform to express its displeasure, despite constituting a fringe view and comprising a small percentage of the population. First, there's the legacy media, still highly influential even in the Internet age, 90% of which are completely devoted to radical identity politics and feminist causes, and where the left-wing media outlets are constantly racing to out-virtue signal each other as being the most ""progressive"" (i.e. feminist) media organisation. Many corporations and large businesses have turned to championing feminist causes as well, and in the general atmosphere of political correctness present in the West today, simply questioning the validity of the feminist cause can be detrimental to one's professional prospects. 

I should also add that in light of the reasoning being used to determine who is vaccinated first, there is actually a very strong argument why a man should be selected to receive the first dose. The death rate from COVID-19 across every age group has been shown to be roughly 2x higher for men as compared to women. Therefore, if an average 80-year-old woman has a 5% chance of dying upon COVID infection, the risk to a man the same age would be 10%. Given that the old and frail are among the first groups to be vaccinated *precisely because* of the elevated risk to their life and health, and the first person to be vaccinated should naturally be  among the most at-risk people who can be safely vaccinated, it would make sense that much of the time, a man should be selected. And while we are on the topic of differential death rates, can you imagine the fervor and outrage feminists would generate if the death rates were reversed, such that women were twice as likely to die as men? The moment cases got out of control, or a government were alleged to have made a mistake by not bringing in enough lockdown measures or not implementing them quickly enough, they would almost instantly accuse that government of being either intentionally or unconsciously sexist, and claim that the pandemic was not being taken seriously because more women were dying. And of course, sharing their ideology, the mainstream media would instantly jump to their support and rubber-stamp their claims as unquestionable truth.

The last thing I wanted to add is that I think this is part of a larger trend toward promoting women at all costs and marginalising men. For example, in 20 years from now, we might actually see the first manned Mars mission. It's likely that the crew will be diverse and co-ed (which I have nothing against, I should add, so long as the astronauts are selected based on merits rather than membership to a particular gender or ethnic group), and when the moment comes to decide who gets to take the first step on the Martian surface, I think it's not difficult to predict what the astronaut's gender will be, regardless of the others' credentials. To do otherwise, after all, would be to legitimize the patriarchy, seemingly eliminated, yet still relevant. And in more down-to-earth (pardon the pun) matters that may affect the average man much more acutely, companies are increasingly being pressured to enforce quotas, not only in employment as a whole, but in the upper managerial echelons of an organisation, to ensure gender equality at all costs, to shatter the pervasive ""glass ceiling"". Naturally, this will come at huge cost to men who will have to try even harder to get the position, lest they be passed over for a woman of potentially lower qualifications, but will be seen as demonstrating the company's commitment to diversity and equality and fulfilling its internal quota. All this despite the fact that study after study has shown that men are actually falling behind women with respect to post-secondary education, and that this gap is widening. Still, this doesn't fit the feminist narrative portraying women as the oppressed and men as the oppressors, so it is largely ignored. And all this is happening while working-class jobs that don't require post-secondary education are precisely the ones being automated and off-shored, leaving many men chronically unemployed with few career prospects. In other words, I don't want to state the obvious, but it's clear that it's certainly a bleak time to be a man right now.",4,0

A toast to equality,"Last night I commented on a Facebook post in a group about a TV series in which one of the characters is trying to reunite with her son, whom she had abandoned 20 years prior for her own well being and left the kid with the psychotic dad.

I mention that in my opinion the character is a bad mother; I had a similar experience when I was young, got a girl pregnant who turned out to be a complete toxic abusive demon and used every trick in the book to fuck with me but I didn't turn my back, I put up the fight of my life in court and ended up getting custody and raising my son without any help nor child support from the mom.  My son is now a grown adult but I'm still dealing with the repercussions that came after.

In comes this lady saying she walked away from her first born due to postpartum depression and mental abuse but later remarried, had two more kids but does not have contact with the first one...

My obvious response is are you serious?  How could you just leave your kid behind with an abusive father? 

Lo and behold! In comes the army of white knights defending her, calling me an asshole, saying I'm hero posturing, telling me to seek help etc. etc.

What's funny to me is, had the gender roles been reversed and I had left my kid behind, never related to him and never paid child support, I would have been labeled as a worthless deadbeat sperm donor, and here I am getting vilified for... having done the right thing?",7,0

Notice how they feel entitled, even as young teenagers, to instigate this kind of confrontation on the street. But especially, notice how quickly and easily they begin calling him a pedophile. Then they go on repeatedly shouting it out, to enlist bystanders.

""Believing all women"" is not about the tragedy of sexual abuse or sexual assault, otherwise we would also care about male victims. It is about _power_. It is about being able to walk around your neighborhood, your workplace, your home, knowing you can end male life with a word. 

Like a lot of young people, these young ladies are using power recklessly. They've been handed a gun, and now they're shooting up the neighborhood. But just replay this video, and consider what sexual abuse really is for them. Not a tragedy. Just a card to be played in a confrontation, to dominate their immigrant victim. That it might end his life (cause him to lose his job, his home, his friends and his family) and is therefore disproportionate (for a moment of bigoted harrassment) is the sort of thing that might occur to them later, when they grow up.

I was falsely accused of stalking an Older Girl. I need to Vent about my Story,"I had a small crush on a girl going into tenth grade. I was a rather naive guy at the time, always drawing up plans on when and how to talk to her, cheesy stuff. By February, I decided to land the knockout blow by sending her a Valentine Gram. Though the day she got it she approached me after school and thanked me, I later found out through a friend that she didn't feel the same way. All right, fair enough. 

I made the mistake of trying to talk to her one afternoon after school, and after some passive-aggressiveness, she told me to my face that she didn't like me. That was the last time I spoke to her.

 A month later, a friend who had known about my crush on her went to breakfast with her. She told me that my crush felt scared because I was ""stalking her"" when walking after school. Now, two things to note here. One, we both walk through the parking lot to get home from school, and two, she's almost a year older than me because I am a year ahead. Instead of blowing it up, I left it alone and avoided her. 

Another month later, and I'm being called to the office over if because ""one of her friends was concerned"". Thankfully, my counselor and the assistant principal who had been told quickly believed me and let me off the hook, but among my peers, hell reigned. The friend who had originally told me about all this betrayed me. Over the summer, most of my closest friends left me as well, except for one, believing me to be silly to be calling it a false accusation. This was in 2019, and the latter half of it was the worst part of my life. At the beginning of Junior year, I was constantly bullied, expelled by people, and recently now in my senior year had to leave my only club because many still held a grudge. Her single action ruined high school for me. 

I live in the Bay Area, a feminist hell hole, so it just hurts to see all these ""women in stem!"" ""believe women!"" and other bs when this sentiment ruined my high school life. When I see men like Johnny Depp get falsely accused, I take it personally, and it makes my blood boil. That's what I have to say, thanks for reading.",71,0

Feminism as academic discipline,"Have you ever wondered how Feminism (aka Gender Studies, aka Women‚Äôs Studies) got to be included in Universities as an academic discipline? It‚Äôs not like it has any of the analytic tools or rigor of an academic discipline ‚Äì there are no feminist academics in our universities crunching away on differential equations. No, it really is just what it seems - the same old ‚ÄúMan bad, Woman victim‚Äù cant puffed up with pseudo-intellectual verbiage. So, why is it treated as if it were a legitimate field of study?

I, for one, have wondered about this. And I was reminded of my undergrad days (in the very distant past) when my routine required regularly passing by the Department of Theology. There was this small, worn plaque outside and steps leading down from the street to a couple of dark basement offices. Quite a comedown for what was once (in the even more distant past) considered the ‚ÄúQueen of Sciences‚Äù. A bit sad even. I suspect the Biochemists next door were just waiting for the last of them to retire, so they could move in &amp; claim the space.

In this same period, across campus, the university had started their first lectures in ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Studies‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt notice this apparent coincidence at the time, but I guess you can see where I‚Äôm heading. In the past, Christianity was the dominant ideology of Western society. Now, not so much. But as it has declined, we‚Äôve seen the rise of Feminism. And - in many spaces, but not all - feminism has inherited the privileged place that Christianity used to have as the dominant ideology of the establishment.

Of course, it‚Äôs not just Feminism &amp; Christianity that have had this place. Marxist-Leninist ideology had a central place in the Soviet education system. Even today, every university in China has a school of Marxism. 

The Nazis also dressed up their ideology as ‚Äúrace science‚Äù and installed it in Universities.

Of course, this doesn‚Äôt stop in Universities. At least here in Australia, feminism is being forced on school students ‚Äì just as was done with Christianity, Communism &amp; Nazism.

PS: It is absolutely not my intent to liken Christianity to, say, Nazism. My point is only about the place of dominant ideologies in Universities. However, if there are any Nazis here who are offended about being mentioned alongside Feminism, (or even vice versa) then I really couldn‚Äôt care less.

PPS: I have, in the past, endeavoured to understand how anyone could consider Feminism an academic discipline. The most common response is a rather unsatisfying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated‚Äù. I‚Äôve also seen the circular justification that it‚Äôs embedded in universities, so it must be an academic discipline. The only argument that made any level of sense was that it has peer reviewed journals ‚Äì like a real discipline. But, if you think that makes sense, then I‚Äôd point out that there were also journals of Nazi race science starting with as Archiv f√ºr Rassen- und Gesellschaftsbiologie (Journal of Racial and Social Biology).",8,0

Victim of fraud and abuse,[removed],1,0
Accused falsely of rape earlier this year so thought I'd tell my story,"This post will be long. Thought it would be best to vent here because this seems like a good subreddit, I've been upvoting and reading posts for a bit and one just similar to this.

I should start by mentioning that I have deep respect for anyone who has dealt with a false allegation of rape. While this story was let's say not as drastic and life effecting as way too many men actually deal with that can come with false rape allegations and furthermore I was in a position where I had supportive friends that knew how deep down messed up my ex girlfriend was.

So I am a 17 year old male, high school student from New Zealand to put some perspective on me. I dated this girl starting from August of last year up until I think the end of July, I became best friends with her after her and her ex who I am now friends with once again broke up and then few months later we started dating.

In reality we ""messed around"" but never had direct sex or any type of sex at all, everyone around school knew about our relationship, everyone knew the guy I was, I'd try my hardest respect her, her boundaries and care for her in every way that I could. She went and told me the day we broke up which was online for the record that she had told her dad about how I was once suicidal but had to go and see a therapist because I didn't want that pressure mounting onto her. I what I imagine to be understandable I  got pissed off because I told her that in confidence not wanting it to get released, especially to her extremely judgmental dad and possibly even worse her mum and told me in a fat rage, that I faked being suicidal for attention (Despite not wanting to tell anyone) and that if I told her that I was suicidal ever again she'd tell me and believe I was just faking it for attention.

Get along to when we went back to school, I had a lot of friends that were real supportive, this happened in the holidays so I had already told them on the day and tension was massive around school but regardless I had my guy friends and even some girl friends. 

It was a Friday and taking a course I wasn't directly at school on a Friday and I get this message from her ex and my now friend, ""She's going around saying you touched her inappropriately and when she told you to stop you called her worthless"" to then by interval ""She's going around saying you fingered her when she wanted you to stop and all this crap"" and I am understandably freaking the fuck out, I'm about 40 minutes away by car from school doing this course and I'm basically just going on all of this crap and can not focus on my work. 

After the course finished for the day, I went into the police station and said exactly to the lady at the counter ""My ex is falsely accusing me of rape"" and they made a note to my name. 

I did not want to face the reality of telling my own mum, I did not want to go and defend my case so drastically so it looks like I'm the guilty one trying to deflect accusations so I didn't. I did tell my mum and the more people she told, the more it became blatantly obvious that she was really trying to ruin me, I do not know why but clearly it started to effect my work performance and stress and create stupidly large amounts of anxiety, talking to my families lawyer, making reports to the school where they didn't do a dam thing except have a 5 minute chat about it to her every report I made which didn't work she only tried to spread it out more.

Not many people took her side, not many people believed it and I'm so glad that I'm open about the person that I want to be because I would never want to do that. People would joke about it with me and I'd receive updates from many sources and even though I had to tell my mum, the school counsellour and my aunty who contacted the school counsellour (She herself is one) she made a real stupid mistake.

She had a 4 day relationship with another guy and went out of it and accused him of rape after it ended but thankfully for him, he was so uncomfortable by how sexually driven she was that he got his friends which ironically were the people who did believe her about the accusations about me, to hang around and called her out, to cut the story, she had to make up a very informal apology which she was forced to send by one of my friends that she tried to contact in an Instagram Group Chat to myself and her now other ex but mainly myself but it wasn't even truthful, she pinned the blame on someone else saying ""Oh well they started it and I just went along with it""

She lost a lot of friends and she only has about 3 now, I mean 3. It's not the ""Oh I only have 3 close friends."" No. She literally only has 3 friends, the only 3 people that will stay by her side through all of this just because they don't have anyone else.

"Privilege, Oppression &amp; Equality","For starters thank you for keeping this community alive, This is my first post in it.

I had a wonderful discussion with a gentleman from here, in case you wish to read it here is the link.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kkdo4d/when\_female\_privilege\_backfires\_this\_completely/gh2ikmt/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kkdo4d/when_female_privilege_backfires_this_completely/gh2ikmt/?context=3)

Without degrading its context, I believe that we need to clarify some things about the current situation with feminism and the ""equality"" that feminists wish ""to impose to patriarchy"".

Given how most of them refer to ""the oppression of patriarchy"".

Let's clarify some things about patriarchy, oppression, and equality.

Patriarchy, is a very, very specific term, according to wikipedia here its definition:

 **Patriarchy is a** [**social system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_system) **in which** [**men**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men) **hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership,** [**moral authority**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_authority)**,** [**social privilege**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_privilege) **and control of property. Some patriarchal societies are also** [**patrilineal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrilineal)**, meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.** 

**This doesn't make any sense whatsoever.**

1) The law system and the military system is full with women.

2) Moral authority: The law system is clearly supporting women to an insane level.

3) Social privilege: Check olyfans for a ""man social privilege"". LOL.

4) Control of property: Check bezos wife for control of property.

These are just examples out of the millions and millions example that we can bring to the table from everyday life to politics, finances, social justice, that irrefutably disprove all the claims of all the feminists in the world.

However, they deny all these, and remove themselves from reality. But why? Let's analyze it.

One of the reasons why there was much more harmony at the older times is that every person was coexisting in a system that was making sense, and his privileges and authority, **were based on his responsibilities and what he/she was offering to the collective.**

What feminists offer to the collective currently? Drama? Justice? Revenge against the women of 1980?

Wrong.

None of those reasons are the real ""whys"" they are behaving like they do, they ignore reality as much as they do, or they have the insanely radical beliefs they do.

The real reason is that, just like every other human, from every other country.

**They were given too much liberty and they never learnt how to appreciate it.**

**Disclaimer: I am not advocating towards imprisoning women mentally/physically/ whatever.**

The whole insanity of feminism to begin with didn't start with the actual-women rights - based organization which was the old feminism. Which did make a lot of sense, no doubt about it. 

Because to be completely fair, some men abuse their authority towards **everyone, not just group.**

So after we crossed the part of the social- equality, we jumped in the wagon of social-progressiveness.

That was the deadly mistake. And look at what happened because of it.

Gradually concepts like religion/ethics/morals were sacrificed in the shrine of progressiveness and liberty, and the narratives were mostly based on the oppressive part of the traditionalism/ patriarchy/ religion/ men-supporting society, blah blah. Bs. 

To be objective here, there was some oppression and there's no doubt that many abused their authority which ended up becoming a miscalculation in the equation of social harmony. But that doesn't justify this borderline madness in both the law system and the society that's completely biased towards women, at all.

Now about the feminists, we're using reddit which is both owned and mostly used by radical leftists, who are practically no different than extremists, however let me tell you this:

Whether feminism is right or wrong, or whether equality between the two genders is correct, or whether inequality is correct there's one thing we can confirm.

**Feminists don't care about equality at all. And everyone who supports them doesn't belief in his/her own beliefs at all**

When someone is so radicalized against a specific group of people, he's beyond saving, I very much doubt that any woman or man can reason with them any time soon.

We should forget about compromising or negotiating with them completely, and certainly not attempt to fight the system that supports them. 

And educate and distant ourselves from them as much as we can.

Daughters, wives, friends, don't increase their numbers. That's the best you can do at this point.

A man wrote on Facebook that he was a representative in a student union when he was seen speaking to a person who was wearing a hat associated with a major political candidate. Some students made up a false story about him, drove him from his position. He was ostracized and alienated, so he left the university. While he is not in the USA, I answered as if he were. Here is some information.

I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.

Please consider a Title IX complaint and discussion with a lawyer.

""Hostile Environment
Hostile Environment is defined as the following by Title IX:

""A situation of discriminatory or sexual nature that has occurred and created a adverse setting

"A long time ago, I was falsely accused of rape. I just want to vent it out.","I want to be clear that I know a lot of men who get false accusations get it a lot worse. I wasn't arrested, no jail time. All of my issues were social.

Probably about 15 years ago - I would've been somewhere between 16 and 17 in this, a female friend called me distressed and crying. She tells me her and her boyfriend decided to smoke weed, since, ""I haven't done it in a long time and he never had."" She said shortly after, he started touching her, she said she wasn't interested, and he continued. She continued that she blacked out in the trauma and came back into awareness with her panties down and not really sure how far it went. 

So - so far this doesn't sound like a false accusation does it? Well, I told her that that is serious and that she needs to talk to the police. She said she's worried they would arrest him. I tell her, ""if he raped you, yes. That's what they need to do."" She says she'll think about it. Fast forward a few weeks and I run into a mutual friend. He's pissed at me - telling me that he's gonna beat my ass. Why? Because, and I quote, ""&lt;female friend&gt; told me how you raped her!"" I did WHAT!? 

So, I find out she was worried I'd go to the cops on her behalf and started a smear campaign. For years, people judged me as a rapist. I remember one incident in particular. My, now, wife and her brother were working at the same place (before her and I got together) and people all the time were asking them why they'd want to be around me as I am a rapist. 

Here's my moral, even if Johnny Depp could tell it better than I. False accusations don't have to take place at a courthouse or on a 911 call. Any court in the world can hear them and that includes the court of public opinion.",223,0

Exposing body is the female primitive method of asking for sex ,  if they ask a women to wear decent clothing she will shout ,  so if they cant suppress their primitive method ,  then how come they shame men for not suppressing their primitive method .
The difference is that the female method is quite and secretive while the male method is loud and criminalized.

Being around exposed women is uncomfortable for men ,  so how come they tell men to avoid staring because its uncomfortable for them ,  but they have no regard for how their clothing affects them ,  especially for religious ones who don't want to be tempted by strange women.

This is some thing I got. From a red pill page. Didn't write this but found interesting.,"When I wondered with myself about the reason for masochism among men, I concluded - according to my own opinion - these facts:
- Firstly, masochism, or masochism - as the dictionary defines it - is a person who enjoys sexually the control of others over him and receiving verbal and physical insult ..
- The female is born innately by the love of the man‚Äôs control over her, especially from the sexual point of view, and this trait remains in the female no matter how feminists try to fight her and implant sadism (as opposed to masochism) in the female psyche to raise her affair in front of the man .. This explains the female‚Äôs dislike and disgust from the submissive man until If she was a tomboy and pretended to be sadism, even if it was out of love to change the routine sometimes.
- As for men, they are born out of an innate love for female control, but unfortunately that instinct has changed because of the society in which the feminine ideas spread that forced men to sanctify the female no matter what she was and whatever she did and the thing they focused on is the female body they made him naked with all kinds of adornment and Encourage her to mix with men while protecting her from his harassment, and this is so that he increases his reverence for her, especially in terms of sexuality, and thus submitting to her in order to obtain from her what he wants regardless of the cost of the matter of dignity and honor.
- The worst cases of changing men‚Äôs instinct to masochism come from families whose females are sadistic, masculine women, and the rest of the cases are affected by what they see in terms of female corruption in society or the media (whether on television or the Internet). The media after the family is the most dangerous reason that broadcasts into the minds of young people the toxins of feminine sadism through beautification. The image of the female and making her a strong heroine and demeaning the image of the man.",7,0

I have posted a few times about how patriarchy theory (as used by modern feminism since the creation of it in 1970 by Kate Millet - an absolute mad feminist according to her own sister and conspiracy theorist) is like flat earth theory (which includes the global cover up to hide the fact that the earth is flat by NASA etc). Flat earth theory and the theory that there is a global conspiracy to cover this up has amazing comebacks for why e.g. no one has found the edge of the earth etc. why private companies who have sent satellites have seen the earth being round.

So I proposed misadnry-archy to explain society, but someone said how come most USA presidents are male. FUCK. My theory ruined.... don't worry friends, misadnry-archy theory still covers this.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Misadnry-archy theory explains our entire society. In misadnry-archy theory society is shaped by the exploitation of men. Both men and women enforce this. This is due to a hatred of men (misandry) which views men only for their utility, whereas women are viewed as innately having value (this is demonstrated in experiments and of course real life and in policy where women are saved over men). Men are viewed only as utilitarian objects which must be exploited to maximise the benefit for society. This is done to privilege women (misdnry-archy allows to live easier comfortable lives, women higher life expectancy, they spend all the money \[90% of consumer spending directly comes from or is controlled by women\] better health, work less hours, only 6% of work deaths are female, women are far less likely to work outside, in extreme weather, at heights, at risk etc. men die in their hundreds of million in wars while women are exempt from service, forced male conscription is prevenaltn all over western developed nations but spares women). Although remember, misandry-archy actually harms women! Women are paid less, less represented as CEOs and presidents. This is misandry-archy back firing on women.  
&gt;  
&gt;Men are oppressed under this system. Any benefits e.g. men in positions of power is actually just utilitarian sexism. I.e. men are given positions of power as under misandry-archy society exploits men for all their utility. They are just success objects. This actually harms men.  
&gt;  
&gt;Evidence for utilitarian sexism includes the fact that men live 4 years (UK) to 12 (Russia) years less than women, 94% of work deaths, higher murder, suicide, rates, and so on.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under misandry-archy all women are privileged, by exploiting mens labour. Of course individual women may be harmed e.g. women may not enter leadership roles and so on. This is misadnry-archy back firing on women. All men are oppressed under misandry-archy.... yes it is true individual men may appear have some benefits e.g. leadership roles, however this is utilitarian sexism viewing men as success objects, only useful for their benefit to society.  
&gt;  
&gt;To help women we must end misadnry-archy. Fighting Misandry archy is for everyone

Next step in misandry-archy I create thousands of ""gender studies"" programmes and teach this in the curriculum to young impressionable men and women, who swallow up this raw shit (sound familiar?

# HASHTAG MISANDRY-ARCHY HURTS WOMEN TOO

&amp;#x200B;

So I posted here:

The article no feminist wants you to read and that they would ban if the could:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/kjs8e1/the\_article\_no\_feminism\_wants\_you\_to\_read\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/kjs8e1/the_article_no_feminism_wants_you_to_read_and/)

Ironically despite me describing how patriarchy theory was a catch all conspiracy theory that could explain all things, i.e. complex phenomenon caused by myriad things with one stupid explanation ""ITS COS THE PATRIARCHY', the feminists replied by explaining how many unrelated issues are actually as simple as being due to patriarchy. Ironically proving the point lol üòÇ I likened this to how flat earth theory people have very sophisticated reasons for why the new evidence that pops up e.g. pictures of earth from space DONT disprove patriarchy theory.

I made a list of all 8 things feminism use as a lists to call black people oppressed and white privileged... so FEMINIST  material... not weird shit made up by me, but THEIR tools, , FEMINISM own list... using those 8 criteria, it actually shows women, all women especially white women are privileged and men especially black men are oppressed.

Now I said, I dont believe in this oppressed privileged simplistic model, but im using feminist theory here, so I will work with it... according to feminism theory women are not oppressors so to speak, not at all, however they are highly privileged and men are oppressed. THIS DESTORYS patriarchy theory and we can't have that!!

Of course.... NO PROBELM... feminise has an answer like flat earth theory solves problems that refute facts earth is round... feminism has an answer. Well the first one is just dont talk about female privilege and keep saying men are privelged to distract the issue. Also use the apex fallacy. Look at top 0.01% men e.g. CEOs and say that is all men even though stats are showing men, are by feminist terms ""oppressed"" in that 8 item checklist

Thats one strategy, the problem with this is eventually people will mention homless men, and life expectancy... I mean to an extent you can downplay this by falsely claiming more women are homeless... but life expectancy is hard (dont get me wrong feminist try though... feminist at UN in the gender equality index under health they knew it would show men as disadvantaged so guess what they did? They made it so women have to live 6% longer than men, if women only live 5% longer that is actually sexism against women! FUCK the gymasnstics)

Other strategy is to say actually all those things are ""patriarchy backfiring"" and actually due to male privilege.... yeah men die younger.... yeah misogyny. And the other usual ones men are homeless because misogyny, women better healthcare spending or life eepxnzactancy because misogyny and benevolent sexism (although feminist also at other times claims sexism in healthcare, they struggle with life expectancy but do try to dodge it)

Anyway feminist replied:

&gt;Of course, a culture that historically pressured men to be strong while infantilising women would lead to a society where more men are victims of violent crime, and women are more coddled in medical settings. This isn't groundbreaking.

Gotta keep that flat earth going üòÇ why did chick cross the road? Cos of patriarchy. COVID? Paatrichy Financial Crisis? Patriarchy? Famine? Patriarchy. iPhone 7? Patriarchy (thats real feminist claim BTW)

&amp;#x200B;

To highlight how stupid such a catch all idea to explain all multi-varied complex phenomena is lets explain these same things feminism says patriarchy caused, and say misandry-archy caused it instead.... the ease at which you can do this shows how stupid and simplistic patarichy theory was in the first place.

# MISANDRY-ARCHY

Rape:

&gt;*Do you know why women are raped? rape is really misandry-archy. Men are viewed only as sexual beings who can't control themselves. To solve rape, we need to value male sexuality. MRA wants to see a world free from sexual violence. Fight misandry-archy*

For example, slut-shaming:

&gt;*Slut-shaming happens to women because men‚Äôs sexuality is seen as dirty and demeaning to them. Men‚Äôs rights activists are very much against that. If we were all MRAs slut shaming would not exist.*

Child-care:

&gt;*The reason we expect women to care for children is that we don‚Äôt trust men doing it. It‚Äôs really just misandry working against women. This is why society needs to end misandry-archy*

The earnings gap:

&gt;*Women make less money than men because we of misandry-archy. Society has a deep hatred for men and doesn‚Äôt see men as having worth outside of providing money to others, and so we encourage men to work longer hours, take longer commutes, set aside their passions, etc.*

Objectification:

&gt;*Women are only treated as sex objects because their sexuality is seen as so valuable and desirable. It‚Äôs an advantage for women (disadvantage for men) Its a case of Misandrdy-archy sometimes backfireing and affecting women too. It‚Äôs like a rockstar who‚Äôs so famous and loved for their music that they have a hard time getting people to pay attention to their other endeavours, like visual art.*

Covering-up in very religious societies:

&gt;*Women are expected to cover up in places of Saudi Arabia because of the idea that men don‚Äôt have any self-control. Fix the misandry and it‚Äôll help women. Misandry-archy hurts women too*

Abused By My Girlfriend | BBC Crime Documentary,,11,0
"Is there anything in this friendship/relationship worth saving, or is this a lost cause?","There is this girl (let‚Äôs call her G) I know for over 20 years, since we were in kindergarten together.
We started dating when we were both 20, but it recently ended after 4.5 years, although we still stay in contact.
During this time I have learned that I am a pretty awesome person to date that has a lot to give, so now my expectations are also rather high.

She and I stayed in contact and we had some flings here and there, however I started to pay more attention to her feminist communist friends (S and B).  
Recently she and they (S and B) came over to my place and we ended up talking about BLM. 
While I support the fight against racism, I don‚Äôt believe BLM is doing a good job at all. They cause too much collateral damage. 
Her friend (B) said that it‚Äôs ok for protesters to release their anger even when it hits small business owners. 
This truly frightened me, since I am a pacifist and believe in peaceful protest, I also felt no remorse or sadness (from S and B) towards the people these rioters were hurting. 

Another issue is, that the girl (G) has been duped into being promiscuous (by B). Her first experience after me was pretty awful, but of course she is going try someone else.
I can‚Äôt tell her what to do, but you guys probably know the stats on promiscuous women.

I do feel like I am being held on the back burner. 
On the one side she gave me 5 of her best years, on the other she has some crazy friends that are a real red flag to me.

I broke of contact with (G) twice and it felt pretty good, to know that I don‚Äôt have to see (S and B) anymore.
G is aware of my feelings towards her friends, but told me she agrees more with them, than with me:(


Some additional information:
The best friend (B) of the girl I dated was very carelessly hitchhiking and got herself drunk and r**** TWICE.
She is the same person that believes destroying the livelihood of innocent people is a valid form of protest.",4,0

I‚Äôm starting to feel a deep seeded hatred form in me and it‚Äôs driving me nuts,"Feminism is just making me lose it. So if I don‚Äôt help a woman I‚Äôm bigoted, if I help a woman I am mansplaining, if I shoe my feelings I have fragile masculinity, if I don‚Äôt I‚Äôm full of toxic masculinity, if I disagree I‚Äôm bigoted, I‚Äôm not allowed to have opinions in ‚Äúfemale only affairs‚Äù and if I do agree with feminism (which I do not) I am a monster, which would be true. 

I never talk about this with my family, ever. Being 14 with a politically correct brother does that to you (love you bro but it can be a lot sometimes). You know how you debate shampoo bottles in the shower about something and then leave the shower and the debate is done. With me that debate never ends. Ever. The fight for equal rights is an uphill one, and the feminists at the top are throwing bricks down at us, and when we throw them back it‚Äôs oppressing. 

Lemme get this straight, I do not hate women. Most of my female friends while not MRA‚Äôs are not one with this modern form of feminism, which I can respect. If I say I do not agree with feminism, then people go, ‚Äúoh so you‚Äôre against equal pay? The right for women to vote? No. No I‚Äôm not you dumb cunt. If I was alive during those times I would be protesting too. But the whole point of protesting is to find equality , and equality was found, but some feminists couldn‚Äôt accept that. They HAD to be the victims no matter what. Something can evolve into something much worse. Take a look at the swastika. It was originally a Chinese (I think) symbol for peace, but then a lunatic with a moustache the size of his dick came along and flipped it around, figuratively and literally.

The dangers of love.,"background:  
in december of '08 my (now ex)wife had her first cyberaffair (ended up with a total of 3 all from Xbox live). my alarmbells were going off for a week or 2 but I refused to let myself be jealous and thus ignored my instincts. I only stopped ignoring my instincts because I accidentally saw a disturbingly affectionate text.   
After was dealt with then in februrary '09 she formed a second affair. I set the loger on the chat program she was using. via this I learned she was making up marital rape stories. after this blew up and she admitted to him that she was lying, she then went back to him and said that she was lying about lying because I made her. I suspected this but was committed to make the marriage (and I was the ONLY member of the marriage who EVER worked).  


story:  
while living in my inlaws basement (due to wife's financial destruction) I was lying in bed while she, 15 feet away on the couch playing Xbox, repeatedly told CyberBF#2 to look at his screen. I quietly got out of bed and went somewhere I could see the TV that she couldn't see me and verified my suspician that she was sending dirty messages. I went to cool off in a shower intending to continue gathering evidence and let her hang herself.   
before I got into the shower she came into the bathroom and confessed everything (she realized why I left and pretended not to). In the insuing argument she told me to hit her because she deserved it. after things cooled down she tried seducing me to show me ""Just how committed to this marriage I am""  
I have since come to the conclusion that these were both efforts to get evidence to go to the police. first attempt to get bruises to file charges for physical abuse (in that moment, had I hit her she'd have been permanently scarred) second try to get a semen sample because despite the gynocentric bent of our courts, it'd still be tough to convince a judge your husband rapes you ""on a regular basis"" when you've not had sex in 4 months.  
the worst thing about it is that I almost gave into her seduction efforts EXCLUSIVELY because even in that moment I did not want to hurt her.",4,0

My opinion and advise to young men on women and relations in general. From an old bloak.,"Since it is that time of the year I want to give some advise as a 59 years old knob who was stupid enough to have 2 children with 2 woman. Please be aware that your expirience can be totally different. I speak strictly for me. Everything that follows is my opinion and what I have expirienced in my life. A little long text but my life is going for a while now. Be warned about bad english grammar. I am German.

1. **My first and most important advise is ALWAYS use a CONDOM! Protect yourself and your semen. Unwanted children will ruin your life. Women have all the power over you as soon as there are children in the picture. Also STD's are real!**

**1.1 Do not let your dick take command over your decisions.** I know this is the toughest part and I learned this the hard way. But this is absoluty crucial!! Is it love or are you just horny? You can be sure its horny (most) all of the time. And in this state you will not make good decisions. And when youre in love it gets even worse. You have been warned! We all make mistakes but I was too stupid to learn from them because my hormons got me good.

1.2 Also be aware as soon as there are children there is mostly no sexlife anymore! You will no longer be the lover. You will become the provider. These are completley different beasts in a relationship. And there is almost no in between. You have to be absolutly sure if you want that. I thought I give it a try. But there is no trying here. It is do or die! Also be ready to be blackmailed at any point from there on.

**2. My second important advise. Do not marry!! You as the man will loose when it comes to a divorce. Even without beeing married there is a (huge) chance she will ruin you. Look at the laws in your country.**

 I was smart enough to keep at least this in mind and never married. At least one accomplishment here. 

3. **My third important Advise. Beeing single is /can be bliss. Your time (except from work), money and everything else is yours and yours alone. If you want to hang around and play videogames you can. You want to do sports. Any time you want. If you are hungry you can eat at any time. If you want pussy go get it. There is plenty waiting for you as long as you take care of your self and not showing that you are totally desparate. But always keep the first advise in mind! And have some discipline. Keep your self and your House clean.**

I am single since 2009 now and my life is good. I am nor rich nor poor but make enough to keep me satisfied. I can have my hobbies without beeing worried to go broke over them. I feel mostly free. As free a you can be in this f. up money driven world. Sure I am thinking about a relation to a woman from time to time. But then I think about the consequences and my mistakes in the past and my urge goes away quickly. And most women in my age are not really attractive to me. Mentally and physically. Younger women are out of the question for me. I am to satisfied to want any trouble in my life. Please be aware that I always liked to spend time with my self. I am alone but seldom feel lonely. I do not need much company. If you are loneley it must be hard I guess. 

4. **Always be your best self. Don't be a dick. If she says no its no. Stay polite. That goes both ways. Don't let them play with you! The world will not stop turning without them in your life. Get a grip and move on. Be nice but not too nice. Else friendzone which is not always a bad thing. Women can be goods friends too. Not all woman are bad or evil. The majority of women I met are good people. But be aware that they can switch quickly. Do not ever trust them with your life. You will get hurt or heart broken. There is no difference between man and women here.**

Good looking women know that they are good looking and they will use it against you to get what they want. They will bait you and keep you on the leash. There are exceptions of course. And the looks get old soon enough. On a scale from 1 to 10 women between 4 and 6 are the best. Me beeing (was) a 5 myself, everything above you forget about it. I had women above my league. It was fun for a while but It did not end well. For several reasons. If you are higher on the scale than me and rich go for them (keep the credit card ready). But even you will be better off below you. Women that do maybe not look that good have often a better character instead. Not all of them. Be aware. 

A relation is always a struggle for both. It is not fairy tales all the time. You have to keep working on it every day. I was too stupid for this part and took too much for granted too many times.

**5. Do not cheat! This is the worst! I did this once with a very good looking woman to a woman that really loved me. Her heart was broken and I feel guilty until today. And the woman I cheated with, which I thought loved me, of course cheated on me and broke my heart too. And I deserved this! Don't be me! Don't be a dick.** 

**6. Never change your self for a woman only. If you do not change for yourself you will regret it and one day wonder what you have become. This is important I have been there.**

**7. Do not argue with woman. You cannot win. Stay calm and go away. Do not let them provoke you. And you can be sure they will try hard. There is no logic to be found here only emotions. If she beats you do not strike back. Go away! There is no self defense for you. Always be aware that they can accuse you of anything and you will be in deep trouble. There is no ""not guilty until proven"" here. Your sentence is written already. You will have to prove that you did nothing wrong. Which can be difficult. And even then you will be ruined forever. It sticks like shit on you. And there is no consequence what so ever for the woman who did this to you. So stay on your toes.**

**8. Don't be a knight. Not anymore. They wont thank you. (Women of my generation and older still do mostly) They feel belittled for reasons that I do not understand. I was educated to be polite, respectful and protective to women. But since feminism this has become an offense or they take it as a weakness. Which I find ridiculus. But what ever they want. Chivalry is no longer on the menu. Have it your way. I do not care anymore. I am very careful with Women younger than me and keep my distance. As sad as it is.** 

Ok. If you read until here I hope you find something useful in my essay. I am of course open for critic. As said this is what I have experienced in my relations to women. And I had a few.

Try to get up and help those in dire need.

 Also, a lot of the posts here are talking about things that aren't issues at all. It's diluting the issues that some of us are forced to face. No-one cares about whether girls reject you or not, they have preferences just like you and me. If a puzzle piece wont fit, forcing it won't help.

Thirdly, and lastly, feminism isn't literally Satan. Feminism is a movement that advocates the abolishment of certain problems, such as getting away with rape and sex slavery, much like how w are against the draft and men having to conform to gender roles.

Need Support /Legal Advice,"I believe I have been manipulated in my (36M) relationship with my now Ex Fianc√©e (38F) 

We have 2 children together and have been in many disagreements this year. I have been feeling very depressed at home due to some of the disagreements and pointed language that she employs during our disagreements.

I had a suicidal episode some months ago and am in counseling for those issues as well as started family counseling some weeks ago.

Communication has broken down due to an instance a month ago for the first time in our 8 year relationship where I became aggressive and I snatched her phone and wanted to throw it against the wall (she believes I motioned to hit her) so she has been using this as a means to prevent communication between us.

She mentioned she is unsure if she wants to be in the relationship in our counseling sessions and is undergoing these sessions to make up her mind; I was fully committed to resolving our issues which I believe many stem from poor communication skills by myself and potentially by her.

After our initial counselor session I asked her to do a personality test to determine our compatibility as I took one for work with my team. This created a conflict resulting in a written ultimatum being received the following day.

Several days later I write her a letter explaining my grievances as we have not been verbally communicating and asking her as in the ultimatum she made clear point to her feeling unsafe and having to call the police (we have not had any instances of violence or etc and have been in the same household up until Monday) where She received my letter and circled the point that she felt unsafe. I chose to leave our shared home and kids to facilitate that need of safety for her but also it became much too toxic for me to bear (I asked her to consider our entire history and if I have ever become violent to which there was no reply), I told her that there is no coming back from this (in hopes to reconsider if she really feels unsafe) and I ultimately left.

I am now on the outside several hundred miles away and there is a refusal to communicate with me (this leads me to believe the safety thing is a crutch and not real but a means to an end) 

I am a black male and she is a white female so I am deeply concerned in going back to this residence to either see my kids or pick up my belongings and to hash out our share of the house items, etc. As it is likely that she will call the police on me out of spite.


TL/DR; Ex Fianc√©e and I had a dispute, she claims it became violent and has threatened me with calling the cops. Feelings of manipulation and emotional abuse have been ongoing for years. Need advice/Legal?

MRA ESSENTIALS (VIDEO): How feminists make their worldview true... and the psychological reason they UNABLE to accept patriarchy myth is false and female privilege is real,"Here Karen Straughan's video:

[https://youtu.be/ybxba2UQSEU?t=1380](https://youtu.be/ybxba2UQSEU?t=1380)

Excellent video worth a watch. I am linking from 23 minutes to specifically answer the question in title, however who video worth a watch.

Describes why feminism will not listen to OVERWHELMING evidence of the contrary of patriarchy myth. One thing video talks of is these factors as being the reason feminists say white privilege is due to:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Life expectancy  
&gt;  
&gt;Violent victimisation (e.g. murder, assault, sexual assault)  
&gt;  
&gt;Educational attainment  
&gt;  
&gt;Access to housing and healthcare  
&gt;  
&gt;Incarceration and disparate sentencing  
&gt;  
&gt;Unemployment  
&gt;  
&gt;Death at work

But these apply to women!! - i.e. women are privileged via same terms (I don't like the term privelge but in feminsit lingo its true) - yet how is it that feminsim is not laughed out of the building for saying men are privelged and women are oppressed? Lecture explains why

I'd say its good to know. However, for MRA moving forward, MRA can move ahead regardless. The way MRA needs to work is very different to feminism. It doesnt need 1 million man marches, or men during bras.... small lobby groups, lawyer groups etc does the job. E.g. success of one man shows like Mark Perry, imagine 10 of him working full time. etc. Men and Boys coalition etc.

E.g. Gun Lobbies and Israel lobbies are tiny, and have small amounts of money... they are immensely powerful however.",41,0

Discussion with my friend about self-defense,"
Today, I was talking to my friend about an incident that happened to my little brother a while ago. Basically, my brother had a fight with a girl in school where she pushed first and he pushed back, and this continued until my brother pushed her with more strength which caused her to fall and have a few bruises on her face. When this happened I was in England (I am from Portugal), and so I wasn‚Äôt there to stop my parents from punishing him and putting him grounded although my brother asked why is it he can hit boys but not girls and my father had no answer to that.

My friend was arguing that by punishing him (although she didn‚Äôt exactly agreed with this method) and put him grounded was a way for my brother to understand that he has to self restrain.

I argued that the girl should have known better instead of continuing pushing.

My friend continued arguing that since men are stronger they should learn restraint instead of being aggressive because one day my brother in an act of self defense might kill someone and so to avoid that he should restrain himself. She gave an example of a friend who got slapped by his girlfriend and although he wanted to hit her, he turned around and left.

I argued that this behavior was going to repeat itself again and she continued to use the self restraint argument.

Overall, I continued not supporting this view and argued that our society does not permit men for self defense, and that although men are educated to not hit women, women are not educated the same. I continued and stated that feminism was not exactly a good thing and if she heard what feminists from first and second wave have said about men, she would believe a different thing.

At the end, she argued that since I haven‚Äôt exactly had a life experience that I don‚Äôt know much about the real world. Since she has experience with ex-boyfriends who were violent with her and other women who were abused that she wishes nothing to happen to me since I am naive.

She argued as well that I have a tendency of generalizing minority situations and from that is my perception of the world. This was because I argued that there were radical feminists in power and that it is why I assumed feminism to be bad.

I think I should probably been clearer in my argument. Probably should talk about how abuse from women is excused and that women and men bit each other at the same rate it just so happens that men are always guilty where women abusers are not.

NMRA contrasted with IMRA,"For purposes of this self post let me use MRA to mean ‚Äòmen‚Äôs rights activism‚Äô and call men‚Äôs rights activism which is not corrupted by intersectionality ‚Äònaive‚Äô, so that I can contrast naive MRA vs.  

naive MRA (NMRA) is activism in favor or men qua men,  just men,  because they are men.   intersectionalist MRA (IMRA) is activism in favor of certain men and against others,  based on a model of intersectional axis of oppression.  

If men are being killed by police,  the NMRA activist will be motivated to stop this senseless killing ‚ÄúHey,  stop killing those men‚Äù they will say.  The IMRA on the other hand will need some additional info,  ‚Äúwhat color are the men,  did you kill them because they are male?  If so that‚Äôs bad ‚Äì but if you killed them for some other reason ima just dip‚Äù    

The IMRA is able to find many reasons to ignore the plight of many different types of men,  color,  religion,  sexual preference,  all the typical intersectional categories,  while the NMRA is just blind to such things,  seeing only men,  who deserve rights.        

Not to get all meta but his forum for instance in an IMRA forum,  heavily influenced by intersectional theory.  Are gay men being sacrificed to murderous death cults from the desert?  We don‚Äôt care.  Are black men being killed by cops?  Maybe the feminists can help them.  What about trans men,  maybe ‚Äòdon‚Äôt ask don‚Äôt tell?‚Äô insofar as no one is picking on them for being trans or mentions that they are trans they are welcome,  but of course,  if they face discrimination for some reason other than being male they can fuck right off.     

Now,  no two men are exactly alike,  even our intersectionalist mods agree.  Fathers rights for instance are men‚Äôs rights,  even tho not all men are fathers.   Men get shafted in divorce and in family court,  those are men‚Äôs issues even tho not all men are married to women.  A good rule of thumb is ‚Äòif it effects straight white men,  it‚Äôs a men‚Äôs issue ‚Äì otherwise GTFO‚Äù",25,0

Fiance leaving me and we have 5 year old daughter. What should I be doing right now legal wise?,"I didn't see this coming at all right before Christmas. One day everything was fine and then like a light switch it all changed. She is from WA and we live in TN so I am sure at some point she is going to try to take off with our child 2500 miles away. She says she won't and wants to co-parent with me here and that she's not trying to file for child support. This will certainly change like the wind on a whim as did her future plans apparently. She also says she has no plan or money or other place to go right now if that makes any sense to anyone, it sure doesn't to me. I'm not even working right now due to Covid, it's just the ultimate mind fuck and worst time possible. I've heard the horror stories about custody and child support and I would like to solidify whatever agreement we can now while she's in good spirits before it's too late.

When did patriarchy cease to exist?,"Encyclopedia Britannica: ""Patriarchy, hypothetical social system in which the father or a male elder has absolute authority over the family group.""

It's obvious that no such system exists today in the West. When did it exist then?

Abraham, the way he is described the Bible, apparently was a patriarch, a sovereign ruler of his extended family (clan) plus slaves. Abraham is a figure that may have lived during the patriarchal age, perhaps about 4 000 years ago. So did we have patriarchy back then? 

Well, not really, because there were other men living in marriages under Abraham. And they didn't have absolute power over their families. Abraham did. That's what patriarchs were, men who had absolute power over their extended families and slaves. 

And male slaves then? It seems that they had very little power over their families. Exodus 21:2-6: 
&gt; When you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing. If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him. If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out alone. But if the slave plainly says, ‚ÄòI love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,‚Äô then his master shall bring him to God, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever.

Unfortunately, I'm forced to admit that it's beyond my erudition to determine when patriarchy ceased to exist because I can't even tell when it existed.",30,0

DOJ source:

Plus the fact that the law heavily favors women in these situations. Men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do. Women are twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted. This gender gap is about six times as large as the racial disparity.

Study source:

A substantial amount¬†of research has suggested that¬†women¬†do, on average, express¬†emotions more frequently than men. Multiple researchers have found¬†that women cry more often, and for a larger duration¬†of¬†time¬†than men¬†at similar ages.

Women may indeed be¬†more emotionally¬†responsive than¬†men.

Study source:

People are more likely to have sympathy for emotional people. Which means women are more likely to receive this as a legal privilege.

Taking all of this into account. We see that women are far more advantaged not only when it comes to the legal system, but especially when it comes to rape. How do you feel about that? How large of an issue is it to you? Is there anything you would do to change it? Would you vote? Would you protest?

[https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/96jun/cancer/kadar.htm](https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/96jun/cancer/kadar.htm)

So....

Feminism in its relentless quest to make women victims even has women most affected in literally the most absurd things (absurd as in if we use feminsit language women are HIGHLY privileged in these)..... healthcare, education, violent crime victimisation using literal gymnastics to make them oppressed. I call this too feminism, victim hood fetish and also stats manipulation and women most affected. 

before I get to that though, healthcare research is not biased towards men at all to press women.... however, lets HYPOTHETICALLY say OK men were favoured in health research, remember we are all feminists right? Sooo... men die around 5 years younger than women, and top 12 leading causes of death are male... now as feminsits we believe in quotas and also special measures right to ensure equality (check yo privelge), so if that is the case, why should medicine actually even be 50:50? If men are dying 5 years younger, doing worse in caners, heart disease, all causes of death surely we would spend MORE and research MORE on mens health if we were good feminists? It never has to be 50:50 in the first place? Right feminists? 

In fact if we use the same metrics feminsim says there is white privlege.... life expectancy, top 10 diseases, access to healthcare, number of insure/uninsured healthcare and general use of health care, educational outcomes, drop out rates, exclusion rates, incarceration rates,  university enrolment etc, crime victim stats, police brutality victims.... all these things make women privileged?

Of course goes against toxic feminism narrative though 

I mean privilege is a rather silly concept as too many holes, will we start to see feminism finally abandon it as the metrics don't add up anymore to claim female orpession or deny female privilege?",3,0

"[Hard To Swallow] The MRA Is Destined To Fail (ALL WOMEN ARE FEMINISTS) [""META-HYPERGAMY""]","
I keep seeing so called red/black pillers online talking about the MRA in a positive light and even holding up known female anti-feminists like Karen Straughan as though they are some kind of shining beacon, and will somehow help us. Its ridiculous, sad and funny at the same time, le female anti-feminst, le ""standing with us"" lol. Like I keep saying, all women are feminists, all these so called anti-feminist women conveniently still use and enjoy all the perks that feminism has created for them, while publicly professing - ""were not like those evil feminist meanies, yes we still choose mates hypergamously, yes we can still divorce you and take 50% of your wealth, yes we can and some of us have had abortions, but hey, at least were against these things publicly"".

Its all too convenient to get to keep all the perks and still speak out against feminism, if they were for men and us reasserting our power, they would not be speaking for us at all, its counterproductive to that very issue. Women are just bandwagoning onto anti-feminism because its the next trending thing, and also because THEY NO LONGER NEED FEMINISM, so now they can abandon ship with all the treasures they stole during their ""pirating phase"" and act as if they are ""the good guys"". They still keep all the rights and privileges that feminism has created for them.

I find it weird, and very blue pilled that so many men don't make that connection, like seriously try and be logical for a minute, isn't it A LITTLE TOO CONVENIENT for women to be able to keep the perks of what feminism created for them, and then NOW BE AGAINST FEMINISM.

Think about it, in a sense we can see that WOMEN ARE EVEN HYPERGAMOUS WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR BELIEFS AND THE GROUPS THEY ALIGN THEMSELVES WITH. They are literally abandoning feminism like it was their past BETA PROVIDER and ""trading up"" to the new and trending, more attractive, anti-feminism while still keeping all the betabuxx (rights and privileges) they got from feminism.

That's why I want to coin this phenomenon as ""META-HYPERGAMY"", because it is hypergamy taken to meta proportions, its hypergamy in of itself, its women being hypergamous WITH THEIR HYPERGAMY (holy shit women are irredeemable, and its sad to see how many men are falling for this shit). Women are literally just trading up in movements THE SAME WAY THEY ARE TRADING UP WITH MEN and blue pilled idiots are falling hook line and sinker for it - ""These women are different"" JFL.

Its like a drug dealer ""leaving the drug game"" conveniently after making millions and laundering it into his own businesses, and then going on an anti-drug crusade trying to get other drug dealers arrested and stop the sale of drugs JFL. Its too convenient and VERY HYPOCRITICAL.

In that sense I have more respect for feminist women than anti-feminist women, anti-feminist women just want to abandon the label due to the current negative connotations it has but THEY STILL WANT TO KEEP ALL THE PERKS THOUGH, THEY AREN'T ABANDONING THAT SHIT ARE THEY?

Please fellow red pillers, black pillers, or any man reading, don't fall for the BS, I don't care about words, I care about actions, its actions that matter, and its very ironic for women to be at the forefront of a men's rights movements when LITERALLY what caused the problems that created the movement, were women having too much power and/or say over how society operates. Its so ironic and ridiculous, they are attempting to solve the problem of female empowerment, by empowering women to argue against female empowerment, bravo MRA's, makes perfect sense, totally not a contradiction.

The MRA is one of the most blue pilled BS groups in existence, they have yet to accept the black pill, accepting the enemy into your camp and expecting significant progress in your goals is ridiculous, but they don't even have the right goals to begin with so that's especially why they will get no progress in changes to improve men's lives, nothing they are advocating for is going to:

1. Lower female SMV
2. Reduce the influence of the female power structure

Those are the things we need to do, and advocating for ""fathers rights"" (which is their shtick) doesn't do shit about those ROOT PROBLEMS that are causing the other outlying problems, that affect men's lives, and leads to fathers having diminished rights. They are attacking sideline points rather than the core issues, because they are so cucked and blue pilled, they are afraid to look at the elephant in the room, and admit to themselves a harsh reality, that WOMEN ARE OUR ENEMIES.

Our mating strategies are diametrically opposed, we are by nature against eachother, a society that favors the male mating strategy (patriarchy) will primarily benefit men, and actually the human collective as a whole, because men prefer stability and fairness, a society that favors the female mating strategy (modern secular society) will primarily benefit women, and WOMEN ONLY, because men will begin to opt out of society, and male productivity will begin to fall dramatically, and men are the work force of the species.

The MRA is destined to fail, and the trend of women hopping on the antifeminist bandwagon, is nothing but META-HYPERGAMY, women trading up, like they do with everything else, they've gotten all the goodies of feminism, and now its time to leave that useless beta behind and move on to the next best thing to get some new perks, and those new perks I believe are more ""security"" based than ""resource"" or ""sex"" based (which is what they got from feminism), because that's what tradcons have to offer, they'll help make women even more of a protected class.

r/MensLib is the Uncle Tom of the Men‚Äôs Rights Movement,"r/MensLib is the Uncle Tom of the Men‚Äôs Rights Movement. 

I‚Äôve spent the last 6-8 months on there, thinking it was an alternative to more problematic subs like r/RedPill but it‚Äôs seriously just a feminist echo chamber that fights for men so long as it doesn‚Äôt criticize feminism or promote the idea that there are any structural forces that negatively affect men and/or benefit women unfairly. 

It‚Äôs a pandering feminist ‚Äúmale advocacy group‚Äù, that exists to serve as a place to talk about men‚Äôs issues in a way that makes the status quo feel better about being hurtful and discriminatory against men. Whenever someone on r/AskFeminists recommends r/MensLib, it keenly reminds me of racial issues I faced in the work place, where white people would feel threatened by the emphasis on giving black bodies job opportunities or any mention of the discrimination black men face, and in response tell me that that conversation makes ‚Äútheir customers uncomfortable‚Äù or makes ‚Äúother coworkers uncomfortable etc‚Äù. 

Feminists, Men‚Äôs Liberation ‚Äúadvocates‚Äù (they only advocate if feminism allows them to) are threatened by disadvantaged men speaking about about their discrimination in the healthcare, domestic violence, criminal justice systems (just to name a few) and how plenty of feminists actively ignore the struggle of men in favor of highlighting the issues with women.

Confessions Of A Sensitive Man - How To Express Your Sensitivity (With HSP Author William Allen),"Do you struggle to fit into the box of ""traditional masculinity""? I had highly sensitive man William Allen on the channel, author of the new book: ""Confessions Of A Sensitive Man: An Unconventional Defense Of Sensitive Men"".

For those of you unfamiliar with the term HSP (or highly sensitive person), it is a temperamental trait characterized by increased sensitivity of the central nervous system and is found in 15-20% of the population. It is responsible for deeper processing of emotional/physical/social stimuli. 

Some of the topics we discuss:

üü° How to be vulnerable around your male friends

üü° Becoming confident in your sensitivity and developing assertiveness 

üü° How we can get society to start taking sensitivity in men seriously

&amp; More! Hope you guys find this interview helpful!

Gendered Carparking - Carlsberg Uk Northampton,"This was something I just remembered talking about shorter cycle to works vs driving.

I worked for Carlsberg UK back in 2019 but was soon told we had 2 car parks:

* 1 for men
* 1 for women (plus some executive spaces)

# Now I was shocked when I heard this - but was I wrong to be?

**Men** across the river, behind a security gate a pub and some sort of social club and a brothel literally connected to our security gate (I often wondered if people passing thought I was going in there) (red and silver gates in the pictures)

**Women**, under the building right next to the offices. (bike racks and exec spaces were in this car park)

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that got me was it was about 5min extra (each way) for me to get through the many security gates, walk over the bridge and along the path to the car park, yet I was expected to work the same hours as a woman. (*more a cheeky ask when I discovered this pointless gendering.)*

Anyway having cycled all my life and raced, I just avoided the traffic and rode down the river to work and let it pass me by. My commute by car 10-15mins + 5. Bike 10-12mins including locking up

&amp;#x200B;

When I challenged people about this I got this answer - ""A women was mugged about 10 years ago on the bridge and therefore for their safety men have to park over there"" 

And this was upheld by security, my 2nd day I was told I had to park in the other carpark, so wasn't just a folklaw. 

&amp;#x200B;

To the point, I actually lived up the road from Carlsberg 15+ years before and had been nearly mugged/mugged even though I was a younger man back then, luckily most time I could outrun or cycle the would-be muggers.  


Clearly the company wasn't moving forward with the times and one my reasons for leaving.  


I mean I understand a woman might feel threatened walking there, but why would a man any less so, I am only 5'6, have big cycling legs but skinny cycling arms. if someone tried to mug me I would be given them my work laptop and phone in an instant, so being a man would give me no advantage.",12,0

I have to be honest, it kinda does annoy me that these articles are acting like all boys could be potential predators someday (when most of them grow up to not be that way). Only a small portion are like that. 

Also, these articles act like only boys make unwanted advances on girls. Throughout my life, while I heard about boys making unwanted advances on girls, I also equally have heard about girls making unwanted advances on boys too. So how about teaching consent and boundaries to both genders? 

I don't agree at all about what this part of the article  [How to talk to your son about consent, boundaries, and #MeToo (inquirer.com)](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/sons-boys-me-too-sex-boundaries-consent-harassment-20180730.html) below says about how this issue should only be gendered:

Has anyone here had experiences with a feminist as a significant other?,"This is a borderline topic but my one and only relationship was with a radical feminist. On the surface I agreed with a lot of the stuff she was fighting for and I never felt totally fulfilled in the male gender role and I was able to explore my feminine side somewhat, which was nice. In the beginning I felt valued and desired, and it was good.


But she had some personality issues, and she started showing me beliefs that were pretty cutting. If she felt threatened in the relationship she would go for the emotional jugular and say horrible things about men and masculinity, things which I internalized because I felt them to be partially true. I won't go over everything that was said but there's some bad stuff in there, like how men are unemotional and less altruistic than women, or how much better women's genitalia was compared to men's.


Long story short, it exacerbated the side of me that questioned my masculinity and left me with some pretty severe dysphoria and self-hate. I am working through that and generally have gotten to a much better emotional place, but I'm wondering if others have felt the same and if this subconscious gender one-uppery is at least *relatively* common amongst self proclaimed feminists. I don't want to put everyone in a box but I am suspicious that having such strong views on a particular gendered topic is a precursor to holding some pretty hurtful beliefs, though I suppose that could go in any direction.",20,0

Here's a quote from radical feminist  **Sally Miller Gearhart**:  **""\`Why have any men at all?' wrote Sally Miller Gearhart in a 1982 manifesto titled \`The Future‚ÄìIf There Is One‚ÄìIs Female.'¬† Gearhart is an advocate of ovular merging, a process that involves the mating of two eggs, which has been successfully accomplished with mice.¬† Only female offspring are produced.¬† I've always worried that one day women would figure out how to get along without us and they would be able to reproduce unilaterally, like sponges.¬† It's not genocide, exactly. It's more like job attrition, the way employers cut back positions without actually firing anyone.¬† \`A 75 per cent female to 25 percent male ratio could be achieved in one generation if one half of a population reproduced heterosexually and one half by ovular merging.' according to Gearhart.¬† \`Such a prospect is attractive to women who feel that if they bear sons, no amount of love and care and non-sexist training will save those sons from culture where male violence is institutionalized.'""** 

Sally Miller Gearhart has a theory that the only way to save the world is to reduce the number of men to ten percent of the total population.

Spurgled. Potential Custody Battle (advice?),"tl;dr is at bottom. 

Okay, so the first girl I said I loved managed to trick me into getting her pregnant. I missed lots of red flags. As we had a previous casual relationship for 5 months and during that time she was never on birth control. She then tells me when we get back together that started birth control. I bought a plan B and a drink for her the next day and drove it to her job and instead of taking it in front of me, she puts it in her pocket. That night she also lied to me about sleeping with her then-current bf (she cheated on him with me, a day before flying to see him for two weeks). Also, she did ask me and her ex to be sperm donors at some point.

Two weeks later, she's on a different island because of job reasons, we're video chatting everyday and what do you know, she tells me she's pregnant. I'm suspect, but you're in this situation you can't change it. So I plan to be there for the first ultrasound, I go over there record it, we get print outs and frames after seeing the heartbeat and have an enjoyable weekend. Then the day after I fly back we magically start arguing and the next day she says she's done. I try and remedy the situation as best as I can, three days later I try and verify if she's serious by sending something simple on instagram, ""True relationships are when two imperfect people refuse to give up on each other"" and her reply was once again, argumentative. I say my piece by saying she never wanted me and I was a moron for not seeing it sooner. 

That same day, I dropped off flowers and a note, expressing us to stay on good terms for the pregnancy at her sister's knowing she wasn't back yet. She came back the next day. I got no reply for this gesture. After that, I reevaluated everything this girl has said to me and that I believed. And I remember her saying she didn't sleep with her ex. So...I sent her one message two days after she got back saying I want a paternity test before I continue financially contributing to the child. But still want to be made aware of any appointments because I do care. She then blocks me on everything and her sister messages me back, asking if want the flowers and note back.

4 days later, my curiosity wanted certainty, so I talked to her ex to get verification and in that you have to trade information, so I told him that she slept with me the day before she got on the flight to see him and that she's pregnant. He calls her up about it, she denies the infidelity says she doesn't know whose kid it is and files a police report for harassment on me the next day. And on the next business day, she gets a temporary restraining order on me.
$1500 for an attorney, because of the small possibility my career was going to be horrendously threatened if that TRO got granted and I get it dismissed. The court mandated her to maintain contact with me through an app and she invited her ex too, even though I truly believe she knows whose it is. She so far is at least communicating somewhat, however she has basically just said the baby is fine and won't answer anything about upcoming appointments and is so controlling that she won't allow me and the ex to ask each other questions. When I did, she said for me to ""stay in my lane, as a potential donor"" 
Yeah, I corrected her, ""Father.""
And she insulted me, saying that biological father and sperm donor are the same for this ""perpose"" and ""is facts and the correct legal terms""
That's what I'm dealing with.

So, TL;DR 
First love used me a sperm donor and tried to remove me from the picture and attack my career legally. She's nearing 3 months pregnant. We're in Hawaii, both 26, I'm active duty, she's guard. She lives with her sister, doesn't have her own place.
Does anyone have any advice how I can manage to win custody when it's born? Because if it is my kid, I can't stand by and let someone who thinks this is an okay way of doing things raise my genes. 

Also, given her behavior (drinking alcohol before plan B incident) and the ultrasound timeline. It fits perfectly for it being my child. Unless there's a third candidate, which is a possibility but unlikely. So she is dragging this dude into our drama lol.",6,0

Conflicts of interest when the same provider offers both foster care services and family reunification services can create the appearance that fathers are being discriminated against as care providers.,"""family reunification"" in this context in many cases where a child is abused while in the care of mom, then a loving and fit father may have had no involvement in the abuse, but is denied custody anyway. The financial conflicts of interests by parties which make substantially more income offering foster care services, while simultaneously offering much lower income producing, but competing, family reunification services, can leave dads feeling like they are being treated unfairly.

Why men commit suicide when they run everything in the world: a RANT,"So, I found out a couple of hours ago that an old work buddy committed suicide. He was always the guy that people turned to when they needed something but for some reason, he could not turn to others. He was married and has two wonderful kids. I just got off the phone with his wife as I tried to relay my condolences. I have talked to him at least once a month for the past 10+ years and I never saw this coming. I talked to him on Tue and we chatted about old times, about Christmas and about my new job. Everything seemed fine, there was no indication, he made no statements that would worry me but obviously, there was something wrong.

So, why did I author the title the way I did, it's because when I went around our circle of friends one of the women said, and I quote ""I understand why women attempt and commit suicide because of all the shit we have to put up with, but why do men since they run everything in the world"", my answer ""Because of people just like you who actually believe that men are the ones in power when in actual fact that vast majority of men have zero power to control their own lives, That's why"".

Stupid Irish law,"In ireland, by law, a woman cannot rape, only a man can rape, and a man cannot be raped either. By law a man can only rape a woman, and if a woman was to rape a man, she will only be charged with sexual assault.

It's amazing how far things have gone in terms of women looking for any and every reason to shame and demonize anything a man does.  

Let's think logically about the act of sending someone roses.  This is something that takes some time, effort and money on your part to let someone else know that they are special to you.  You are not infringing upon their space and in most cases you are not even setting foot on their doorstep or going to their job as roses are often delivered.

Feminism is a major impediment to egalitarianism by trying to hijack all issues e.g. racial justice and turning it about feminism (post by selfdisciplinedlife). Toxic feminism #4 - hegemonic feminism.,"From user selfdisciplinedlife:

There is a serious problem in our society with hegemonic feminism wherein radical feminists attempt to dominate and control any and all discussions about equity and justice in order to impose a particular ‚Äúgynocentric‚Äù (sorry, I can‚Äôt think of any other term that fits) interpretation on those issues. Hence, the problem of violence in our society is transformed into a problem of ‚Äúviolence against women‚Äù, domestic abuse (most of which is against children) becomes domestic abuse against women, and even racism gets colonized by radical feminism to emphasize how it‚Äôs really a problem relating to ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù (in fact, the black rights/justice movement was effectively taken over by radical feminists). When that happens, practical, effective and FOCUSED solutions to solve or alleviate those problems (like expanding police training, gun control, community policing, better outreach programs for people at risk) are derailed in favour of unfocused fundamentalist approaches designed to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù the problem by first radically restructuring all of society (defund the police, end capitalism, etc). There isn‚Äôt a scrap of evidence that radically restructuring society would solve these problems- indeed, the objective evidence show's the opposite is much more likely to happen.

Humans have successfully solved complex problems with fixed, well defined and FOCUSED solutions. Those are the solutions that actually work. For example, consider the problem of unwanted pregnancies. Imagine if instead of introducing abortion and reproductive rights laws (a focused approach) we instead decided to restructure society so that there were no unwanted pregnancies because women wouldn‚Äôt get pregnant until they were happily married in a strong committed relationship. How many unwanted pregnancies would have been avoided in the last 30 years using that ‚Äúsocietal restructuring‚Äù approach? I imagine not one unwanted pregnancy would be avoided - in fact I suspect the problem would have been greatly increased.",36,0

What studies exist that legitimize claims that female under-representation is in part due to bias?,"I saw [this article](https://quillette.com/2020/07/27/the-myth-of-pervasive-misogyny/) posted on this subreddit the other day, and reading through the studies, I didn't want to get biased by availability. 

I had a former female friend (who has never been in the workforce and only in academia) tell me that there was a study that sent resumes to companies, holding all else the same except the gender. The result was that supposedly the resumes with male names were more likely to be hired in STEM. A study like this would absolutely show that women are biased against in careers. 

Now, I looked up on pubmed about gender biases and couldn't find anything of the sort. The studies that I could find that hold all else the same and only change gender demonstrate bias in women's favor. All the studies I could find purporting discrimination against women in hiring simply show discrepancy in hiring percentages or representation and the authors then attribute said discrepancy to bias. 

This seems to be pretty consistent across most articles I could find where women were shown to be discriminated against. The authors show that on average women receive proportionally less than men in something, like pay, representation, promotions, etc. after holding one or two variables consistent, like job or reported productivity, and then attribute said difference due to discrimination.

I came to my final conclusion of what to believe and what not,"Hello there, i like to start of by saying im happy ive done my research and ended up here.

Im a 15M and well im new to all this, but ive started thinking about it, ever since my philosophy teacher (a feminist) (M) started making anti-men and overall sexist remarks. I wanted to do my research so i searched and ended up here. And i like to thank this sub. This sub made me realize that: Feminism isnt always about equal rights, its (mostly) about empowering women, doesnt matter at what cost. Ever sincethe words of my philosophy teacher hit me, ive been thinking. Sure, women deserve rights just as much as we do. But feminist (most of the times) look down on us. For what reason i dunno. But coming into contact with a feminist has made me realize that. Every argument i brought up, he ended up shooting it down, or trying to make a comparison off, like he wanted to make a race

Per example: i told him: ''the most suicides are done by males''
And i found him reacting with ''well women also try commit suicide'' or ""the most attempts are done by females"". 

Safe to say it made me angry, people like this dont think we are concerned about the female deaths, what everyone is trying to say with the statment is that there is a lot of male deaths as well, when i bring up the argument i intend to make him recognize that male suicide is a serious thing, and we shouldnt make it a race or anything that comes close to death. What im getting at is: most mens rights arguments arent meant to shoot down females, but there to make people recognize that men do also have these problems

If mods take it down thats fine: maybe this was a vent (not in my eyes). But im just trying to give a story that subs like this help. They give new perspectives to an otherwise horrible argument. So thank you

APA guidelines for men sounds a lot less like guidelines to help men and a lot more like a guideline on how to train your dog.," 

&gt;When working with boys and men, psychologists can address issues of privilege and power related to sexism in a developmentally appropriate way to help them obtain the knowledge, attitudes, and skills to be effective allies and potentially live less restrictive lives. Male privilege tends to be invisible to men, yet they can become aware of it through a variety of means, such as education (Kilmartin, Addis, Mahalik, &amp; O‚ÄôNeil, 2013) and personal experience (O‚ÄôNeil, 2015; O‚ÄôNeil, Egan, Owen, &amp; Murry, 1993). Indeed, awareness of privilege and the harmful impacts of beliefs and behaviors that maintain patriarchal power have been shown to reduce sexist attitudes in men (Becker &amp; Swim, 2012) and have been linked to participation in social justice activities

Sounds a lot less like guidelines to help men and a lot more like a guideline on how to train your dog. The entire publication falters between saying #notall men and then continuing to insist that all men are liable to fall into some patriarchal domination complex where success cannot exist without sexism. It implies men are not thousands of patients with varying issues and self agency, but one patient under the presumption that masculinity is toxic.",23,0

I can't speek for all of but these are my thoughts on men's mental health.,"So I live in a very supportive family, my parents never told me not to cry or did anything to make me feel uncomfortable crying or telling people my emotions, they actually always stress how important it is. I still find it very uncomfortable crying openly. I think it's men's nature to not talk about feelings and emotions, not that it's good or that's what we should do.

Now am I saying don't take men's mental health seriously, I am just saying that I think most of us would still hide our emotions. I see way to many guys blaming women but in reality It's us.

The most cited male privilege checklist is bogus part 2,"This is part two of the response to the male privilege cheklist me and u/FinallyReborn saw on Instagram. Here's a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kfhvq2/the_most_cited_male_privilege_checklist_is_such/) to part 1 which was written by me.

&gt;I can be confident that my co-workers won‚Äôt think I got my job because of my sex - even though that might be true.‚Äù

We've been pushing the narrative that men are more likely to be hired in jobs than women are, they are paid more, they receive more feedback, girls are pushed away from certain jobs due to negative stereotypes and institutional hostility against them in science and yet people believe women are getting jobs because of their gender? That's why I called you hypocritical as you, like most people, especially those in academia and in the media, assume men are getting cookies for being male and the odds are skewed in their favor, but still claim people are unfairly saying to women they are the ones who are getting the upper hand. And really, would it be illogical of **some** people to perhaps question how some women get their positions when what we've been doing for the past few decades is demanding more and more female diversity in the workplace which has led to people like James Damore getting fired from their workplaces for daring to question it? For those of you who are unaware, James wrote his Google memo which was a review of the scientific literature on sex differences between men and women which suggests women are often driven away from STEM because of the preferences they have which are biologically based. The purpose of the memo was not to say no woman can experience hostility or discrimination - it was rather to call out the impractical approaches Google was employing, which are sometimes discriminatory, to increase diversity. James was fired for the sole purpose his memo was seen as ""misogynistic"" and an ""obstacle to female friendliness in the workplace"".

&gt;If I fail in my job or career, I can feel sure this won‚Äôt be seen as a mark against my entire sex‚Äôs personalities.

Women are assumed to be better at handling and caring for children, as men are often assumed to be [pedophiles](https://workinprogress.oowsection.org/2012/09/22/early-childhood-education-no-place-for-men/) when they care for children. It is safe to assume a man who is working in a female dominated field would feel pressure as he is breaking out of traditional male gender roles.

I find it hypocritical you are saying that when all of your work-related points operate on the basis that men are seen as more capable than women. Generally, that means a man who doesn‚Äôt live up to his expectations (of having to be capable and competent) will be ridiculed. That is seen in basically every form of society's look on men nowadays when men fail to live up to their expectations. Gay boys have around a [3x](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0162243911402363) higher suicide rate than lesbian women, and are [4x](https://archive.is/EMpR1) more likely to be a victim of a hate crime, why is that?

Your argument lacks nuance in its views on gender.

&gt;If I do the same task as a woman, and if the measurement is at all subjective, chances are people will think I did a better job.

Factually untrue. Women on average get more [positive feedback](https://psyarxiv.com/yq24b/) than men. Nuff said‚Äô.

&gt;I am not taught to fear walking alone after dark in average public spaces.

That is a type of female privilege, considering the fact that men are more likely to be a victim of every form of [hate-crime](https://archive.is/EMpR1), around [80%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1635092/) of homicide victims are men, men are over [2x](https://web.archive.org/web/20200629012832/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/vvcs9310.pdf) more likely to be victimized by a stranger, and around [90%](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bjs/104274.pdf) of men will be a victim of at least 1 violent crime.

Teaching women to be cautious is a privilege as it means people care when women are victimised, but not when men are and I really have to wonder who continues to perpetuate that fear. Lemme give you a hint - it starts with the word **f**. 

&gt;If I have children, nobody will think I'm selfish if I pursue a career.

If fathers don‚Äôt work full-time, and don‚Äôt provide a certain amount of money, they will be labelled ‚Äúdeadbeats‚Äù. Mothers who pursue a career are often glorified for ""defying the norm"".

&gt;Chances are my elected representatives are mostly people of my own sex. The more prestigious and powerful the elected position, the more likely this is to be true.

Chances also are that the person sleeping on the sidewalk you passed by today is also a man, but that‚Äôs irrelevant to you because such men are invisible to women and most of society.

The elected 2020 Vice President is officially a woman and Joe Biden has created an all-female team for the sake of diversity. There are quotas on corporate boards for women in many countries as well as quotas for women in politics, so the narrative is changing in favour of women. 

&gt;As a child, chances are I was encouraged to be more active and outgoing than my sisters.

Probably true. However such encouragement can turn into an active expectation wherein boys who are more introverted are pressured to be active and outgoing and if they aren't, they can be shamed for being lazy, unproductive, feminine, etc...

&gt;I can turn on the television or glance at the front page of the newspaper and see people from my own sex widely represented, every day, without exception.

A [study](https://archive.is/NHC61) made by Jim Macnamara that looked at over 2,000 media segments, found that around 69% of men‚Äôs portrayal in the media was negative, 19% was moderate, and only 12% was positive.

""Men were predominantly reported or portrayed in mass media as villains, aggressors, perverts, and philanderers, with more than 75 percent of all mass media representations of men and male identity showing men in one of these four ways,"" Dr. Macnamara says.

Victimized women also get [3x](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7586&amp;context=jclc) more media representation than men.

Such negative representation of men in the media is bad for boys regardless of its quantity.

‚ÄúHighly negative views of men and male identity provide little by way of positive role models for boys to find out what it means to be a man and gives boys little basis for self-esteem.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the current environment where there is an identified lack of positive male role models in the physical world through the absentee of fathers in many families and a shortage of male teachers, the lack of positive role models in the media and presence of overwhelmingly negative images should be of concern.‚Äù

&gt;If I‚Äôm careless with my driving, it won‚Äôt be attributed to my sex.

Women on average are worse drivers than men whether you care to admit it or not. In a [study](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2012188/Women-drivers-ARE-dangerous-wheel-scientists-discover.html) that took place over a 9 year period, women were involved in nearly [70%](https://cars.lovetoknow.com/about-cars/how-many-miles-do-americans-drive-per-year) of total car crashes, despite men on average driving 40% more miles per year.

The same can also be said about men and abuse/rape. Rape is viewed as a male perpetrated crime, so is abuse and feminists often like to attribute such toxic behavior to men as a group (e.g Susan Brownmiller).

&gt;If I have sex with a lot of people, it won't make me an object of contempt or derision.

Men are called ‚Äúfuckboys"". Incel and virgin shaming tactics also exist and they are primarily targered at men. Calling a woman a slut, or a hoe is socially unacceptable. Calling men an incel, virgin, fuckboy isn't. In fact, incel shaming is more often encouraged than discouraged.

&gt;My wardrobe and grooming are relatively cheap and consume little time.

Men's and women‚Äôs clothing is similar in [price](https://gulfnews.com/lifestyle/fashion/clothing-prices-which-gender-has-it-more-expensive-1.60001260), but women's clothing tends to have more complicated designs and there is a higher selection of women‚Äôs clothes than men‚Äôs, so it is logical to expect that women‚Äôs clothing would be more expensive in general.

&gt;I can be confident that the ordinary language of day-to-day existence will always include my sex. ‚ÄúAll men are created equal,‚Äù mailman, chairman, freshman, he.

That also includes words like gunman, knifeman, manspreading, mansplaining, etc... The phrase ""all men are created equal"" means all people are created equal as the word man meant person and people generally understood it that way. Look at feminists not understanding language...

&gt;I will never be expected to change my name upon marriage or questioned if I don‚Äôt change my name.

The only people that will actually question you are your average 70-year-old republicans Joe and Mary and even they might not do it - 99% of us won't care. Women hold most of the cards in marriage, but oh are they oppressed when somebody, slightly more traditional, questions their name...

&gt;Most major religions in the world is led primarily by people of my own sex. Even god, In most major religions, is usually pictured as being male.

Do you know who else is pictured as being male in most major religions? The Devil. Most religious people are [women](https://www.ncls.org.au/news/women-more-religious). This doesn‚Äôt seem to be an issue for them. Why is it one for you?

&gt;If I have a wife or live-in girlfriend, chances are we‚Äôll divide up household chores so that she does most of the labor and in particular the most repetitive and unrewarding tasks.

Let me rephrase this point too, ‚ÄúIf I have a wife or live-in girlfriend, chances are we‚Äôll divide up household chores so we do an equal amount of labor, in proportion to the amount of work we do‚Äù.

Accounting for all [labor](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/), men spend a total of 63 hours per week, compared to the 57 hours women spend. It is easier to argue that men are doing too many household chores in proportion to the number of hours they do in every other form of labor.

&gt;If I have children with a wife or girlfriend, and it turns out that one of us needs to make career sacrifices to raise the kids, chances are we‚Äôll both assume the career sacrificed should be hers.

Yeah, because in the majority of households it‚Äôs the man who is expected to pull in the primary paycheck, so it would be logical that the parent who is pulling in the least amount of money should be the one to sacrifice their work, in the majority of cases, that person is a woman.

&gt;On average, I am under less pressure to be thin than my female counterparts are. If I am fat, I probably suffer fewer social and economic consequences than my female counterpart does.

Publicly making fun of an overweight woman is socially unacceptable, it isn‚Äôt for men. According to this [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.22162), 40% of men experience weight discrimination. Body dysmorphia in [men](https://themeadowglade.com/what-body-dysmorphia-looks-like-in-men/) is just as common as it is in women. But what about height discrimination? [Employers](https://www.baylor.edu/mediacommunications/index.php?id=18402) are 72% more likely to employ the taller man, even when the shorter man has similar, or slightly better backgrounds and skills. Men get on average $600 more per year in salary in each increased inch in height.

Difference here is, weight is controllable in most cases whereas height is mostly genetic.

&gt;Complete strangers generally do not walk up to me and tell me to ‚Äúsmile‚Äù.

This has happened to me, a male, dozens of times. Complete strangers generally do not walk up to you and rob you, beat you, kill you which are crimes men are more likely to experience, but of course, complain about being asked to smile, which isn‚Äôt even a gendered issue, nor an ‚Äúissue‚Äù.",6,0
The post cited male privilege checklist is bogus part 2,[deleted],0,0
The most cited male privilege checklist is such bogus,"
I was scrolling through Instagram and I stumbled across a [male privilege checklist ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIQbKpxL5Lh/?igshid=kd8rnp3y2yr4) most of you are probably aware of. However, me and a friend of mine (u/FinallyReborn) still wanted to cover its points here. I will segregate the post into two sections (part I which will be addressed by me and [part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kfjbpx/the_most_cited_male_privilege_checklist_is_bogus/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) which is addressed by him). Also, the points are not in order, but I don't think that matters. What matters are the points themselves. 

# Part I

&gt;My odds of being hired for a job, when competing against female applicants, are probably skewed in my favor. The more prestigious the job, the larger the odds are skewed.

How do I begin to unpack this? 
- STEM favours women in a ratio of [2:1](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360)
- Blind hiring (that is the gender of the applicant is not known) favours men whereas non-blind recruitment [favours women by a couple percentage points ](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-30/bilnd-recruitment-trial-to-improve-gender-equality-failing-study/8664888).
- Men, on average, are more likely to be discriminated against when job hunting, which includes [both male and female dominated jobs ](https://www.amhf.org.au/national_health_strategy_great_news_for_men).
- [This 2019 study ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537119300429#bib0013) also found discrimination against men in hiring. 
- [This ](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/rabble-rouser/201906/are-scientists-biased-against-women-scientists-part-i) and [this](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/rabble-rouser/201906/are-scientists-biased-against-women-scientists-part-ii) article on discrimination against women in science which examine more than hiring, find either no bias against women or more anti-male than anti-female bias in science. 

The idea men won't face discrimination in hiring and the odds are skewed in their favour especially in prestigious fields like STEM is false. The narrative stems from gender stereotypes such as female vulnerability that expects women to always be the recipients of discriminaton or injustice which itself is a type of bias against men.

&gt;If I am never promoted, it's not because of my sex.

That's supported by? Most of the claims which are made in this checklist are either baseless or outright false and one-sided. (see above)

&gt;I am far less likely to face sexual harassment at work than are my female co-workers.

Perhaps, it is true ""men are less likely to face sexual harassment"" in the workplace, though I am skeptical of the word ""far"". [Men represent 1 in 5 complaints of sexual harassment in the workplace in the US ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/men-account-for-nearly-1-in-5-complaints-of-workplace-sexual-harassment-with-the-eeoc/2018/04/08/4f7a2572-3372-11e8-94fa-32d48460b955_story.html#click=https://t.co/qlAIX7lYzh) and the number could be heavily under-counted as men often under-report their abuse ([here](https://archive.is/idxmc#selection-1853.0-1863.28) and [here](https://archive.is/Wn1ev)). [Attitudes ](https://archive.is/s7UOk#selection-139.466-139.889) like this exist: ""If a woman pats a man‚Äôs butt, admiringly asks whether he‚Äôs been working out, and suggestively compliments him on how good he looks, people chuckle. If the roles were reversed, those same people would be outraged (and rightfully so)"". It could also be that men are less likely to be taken seriously and [women are less likely to be viewed as perpetrators](https://archive.fo/JaI4J#selection-1111.0-1114.0): 
""In the¬†Horizon Oil Sands work camp in Alberta, men who are caught in women‚Äôs dorms are fired on the spot, while women are allowed in the men‚Äôs dorm rooms."" 

Harassment in general is reported to be proportionally equal for both sexes. [This study ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233447134_Bullying_at_work_Epidemiological_findings_in_public_and_private_organizations) looked at bullying at work and found that ""men and women did not differ in prevalence"". [Another study ](https://bit.ly/3qMdYHt) looked at workplace bullying and found ""no significant differences in the bullying experiences of men and women"". [A study in Sweden ](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13594329608414853) looked at the prevalence of mobbing in the workplace which is defined as ""harassing, ganging up on someone, or psychologically terrorising others at work"" and found ""men (45%) and women (55%) are subjected [to workplace mobbing] in roughly equal proportions, the difference not being significant"". [A report by StatsCan ](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2018001/article/54982-eng.htm) found that ""19% of women and 13% of men experienced workplace harassment in the past year"". 

&gt;If I'm a teen or adult, and if I stay out of prison, my odds of being raped are so low as to be negligible.

False. The odds of men being raped outside of prison (which is obviously excluded to prove a point) are not low or negligible (once you start to look at rape in a more nuanced manner and expand the definition of rape to be inclusive of victims who weren't penetrated and were instead forced to penetrate their perpetrators, the narrative crumbles apart). I also love how they say ""if I stay out of prison"" as if men simply choose to be in prison and there is no bias in sentencing and men's criminal behaviour is not a product of environmental causes like fatherlessness [which is not true ](https://becauseits2015.wordpress.com/2017/01/29/justice-system-discrimination-and-the-myth-that-sexism-against-men-isnt-institutional/). To get back to the ""the rape of men outside of prison which we will conveniently exclude because reasons is low to the point of being negligible"" claim, the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey would like to disagree:
- [The NISVS (2010)](https://bit.ly/2DTxNsE) showed that during the proceeding 12 months of the survey, 1.1% of men were made to penetrate and 1.1% of women were raped. Table 2.1 and 2.2 pages 18-19.
- [The NISVS (2011)](https://bit.ly/32tSiWb) showed that in the past 12 months of the survey, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.0% of women were raped. Table 1, page 5.
- [The NISVS (2012)](https://bit.ly/2RIrKjM) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.2% of women were raped. Table A.1 and A.5 on pages 217 and 222.
- [The NISVS (2015)](https://bit.ly/3irgz4S) showed that in the past 12 months, 0.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.2% of women were raped.

Just as a side note: we say made to penetrate instead of rape as the CDC does not consider made to penetrate to be rape and instead puts it in the category of sexual assault which leads to media under-reporting of the problem of the rape of men. The idea that the rape of men outside of prison is low or negligible is another myth that is rooted in gender norms which are again more advantageous to women as their victimisation is universally recognised whereas men's victimisation is swept under the rug. In case anybody brings up the fact that I am only quoting annual data and not lifetime data which found a high prevalence of male victimisation once made to penetrate is lumped in the same category as rape, I am doing that because lifetime data has less accuracy as it runs into more problems such as memory loss, confusion of events, how well one interpreted their victimisation which might have taken place long ago, etc... [This source notes:](https://bit.ly/3hmTpLH) ""Research tells us that 20% of critical details are irretrievable after one year of their occurance and 50% are irretrievable after 5 years"". This could heavily skew the data in favour of women as they are less likely to internalise their victimisation and more likely to report.

&gt;If I choose not to have children, my masculinity will not be called into question.

Incorrect. [Here](http://imgur.com/gallery/uBlqRTu) and [here](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/251005379202625072/). 

&gt;If I have children and provide primary care for them, I'll be praised for extraordinary parenting even if I'm marginally competent.

Assuming that's true (for the sake of argument), it is only half of the story - that is while there are fathers, single or married, who are praised for doing ""mommy's work"", often for a valid reason, there are also fathers who encounter day-to-day stereotypes and hardships for not living up to their traditional role of a provider. For instance, [this survey ](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/03/23/gender-and-caregiving/#many-say-mothers-do-a-better-job-caring-for-a-new-baby-than-fathers-but-about-seven-in-ten-say-its-equally-important-for-babies-to-bond-with-both) found mothers are seen as better caregivers and fathers are more likely to be pressured to work more and be financially liable for their families. We can reason that if that's the case, then a man who breaks out of his gender role and takes on a ""mother's job"" will be seen as a deviant and often encounter negative stereotypes about his gender and his abilities will be put to question. [This video interview (skip to 6:14) as the actual video has been made private ](https://youtu.be/DjCuEUftz4w) describes motherhood which it synonymously links to parenthood as the ""hardest job"". Additionally, anybody who has spent some time on social media platforms such as Twitter can notice a pattern of people including [verified accounts ](https://mobile.twitter.com/torylanez/status/1274768830980599808) turning Father's Day into a day about single mothers or mothers in general. Therefore, it is quite absurd to say that a father who is marginally competent as a caregiver will receive extraordinary praise as opposed to a mother who does the same job better. 

&gt;If I seek political office, my relationship with my children, or who I hire to care for them, will probably not be scrutinised by the press. 

Unless, of course you're Donald Trump in which case everything you do will be examined by the media and used against you. [This article ](https://www.thelist.com/263027/the-truth-about-donald-trumps-relationship-with-his-son-barron/) analyses Donald Trump's realationship with his son, Barron Trump and [this article ](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/05/donald-trump-kids-normal/amp) goes on to examine how Trump's children grew up ""relatively normal"" as well as who took care of them, etc, etc.... 

&gt;I can be somewhat sure that if I ask to see ""the person in charge"", I will face a person of my own sex. The higher-up in the organization the person, the surer I can be. 

That benefits me, how? As a woman, if you go outside, the odds are the overwhelming majority of people at the bottom you will see such as construction workers, or the unsheltered homeless, will be men. 

&gt;As a child, I could choose from an almost infinite variety of children's media featuring positive, active, non-stereotyped heroes of my own sex. I never had to look for it; male protagonists were (are) the default. 

As a child, I saw myself represented as an antagonist in almost every cartoon or TV show. The servants of each villain who were killed one after another like a disposable pile of garbage were also universally male. Such ""servants"" continue to be almost universally male as people prefer men dying in movies to women dying or being tortured. The ""default protagonist"" is not male either (Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Supergirl). The existence of male protagonists in most movies especially romantic ones encouraged boys to turn into risk taking or self-sacrificing men who leave their well-being behind to protect people especially women and children. 

&gt;If my day, week or year is going badly, I need not ask of each negative episode or situation whether it has sexist overtons.

Privilege is not defined or measured by one's inability to recognise whether somebody was sexist to them or not because of how normalised society's inability to spot misandry is. Privilege is having society pander to you and your issues to the point where you become paranoid and question everything or everybody for potentially being misogynistic to you and always blaming others for your misery because of how little accountability you are expected to take for your own problems. It is not ""women caused their own issues"", it is almost always ""society or HE caused these issues"" meanwhile for men it is almost always ""he caused his own issues"" or ""other men caused his issues"". 

&gt;If I am careless with my financial affairs, it won't be attributed to my sex.

As a woman, if I am incapable of earning enough money or a high income, that won't be blamed on my sex's inability to provide. 

&gt;I can speak to a large group of people without putting my sex on trial.

So can women. In fact, [women can freely talk about raping men on a stage that is supposed to be empowering to women and treat it like a joke](https://www.instagram.com/p/CH-mgQzgj5a/?igshid=18k1s81yex8ou)

&gt;There are value-neutral clothing choices available to me. It is possible for me to choose clothing that doesn't send any particular message to the world.

So it is for women. Women can also wear their boyfriends' casual clothing and still be seen as cute. A man wearing a dress or his girlfriend's clothing is enough for him to be called a ""beta male emasculated cuck"" by prominent political figures such as [Candace Owens ](https://romanshcheezit.medium.com/no-conservatives-dont-care-about-men-95d25513e678) or even beaten up in more traditional countries whereas women can wear traditionally masculine clothing such as suits and nobody bats an eye. Men are also expected to wear clothing and accessories which signify status to the world (expensive watches, ties, suits). 

&gt;If I am not conventionally attractive, the disadvantages are small and easy to ignore.

Not if you are short and skinny. Employment opportunities decline, so do dating opportunities (I wouldn't consider that to be ""easy to ignore"").

&gt;I can ask for legal protection from violence that happens mostly to men without being seen as a selfish special interest, since that kind of violence is called ""crime"" and is a general social concern. (Violence that happens mostly to women is usually called ""domestic violence"" or ""acquaintance rape"", and is seen as a special interest issue.)

This one is so detached from any observable reality that you can lose brain cells just reading it. Crime that happens to men is not seen as a special social concern (domestic violence and rape are both called crimes, if not some of the worst crimes one can do to another - ""rape is so vile that only murder is worse"". If they are listed out as separate issues, that is because they are viewed as separate, more concerning crimes which we should pay more attention to), or at least not because it happens to men (the crime which is gendered against men is homicide, 77-80% male, so it might sometimes make sense to prioritise it, say, over intimate partner violence which is also 40-50% male, check out the NISVS). However, violence against men is not seen as a ""special concern"" - violence against women by men is seen as a special concern. You will rarely see campaigns saying ""end violence against men"", ""teach women not to be violent"", but almost all of such gendered campaigns are gendered to favour women. Domestic violence and the rape of women are put at the front of political discourse to the point where universities [deny male students their due process rights ](https://archive.vn/649JL) when they are accused of rape. Women are systemically favoured in both [police intervention ](https://archive.is/M5N5v) and [services ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175099/) for victims of domestic abuse. The overwhelming majority of services are for women and the overwhelming majority of batterer programs are for men, that is in spite of the consensus in family violence research being that women commit intimate partner violence equally, if not more (once you account for unilateral violence which is mostly done by women and lesbian on lesbian violence which tops heterosexual violence and gay male violence). In some other countries like India or Spain, male victims have even fewer legal protections from partner abuse which in Spain is labelled ""[gendered violence (the blog is in Spanish so use a translator to understand it if you are not Spanish) ](https://diferenciaslegaleshombremujerenespana.law.blog)"". The idea male victimisation is a ""special concern"" and that's a privilege is laughable and not in touch with reality. In reality, violence against men is and [has been ](https://youtu.be/JHkGZvC0z4I) minimised, dismissed or excused, especially when it takes the form of genital mutilation where boys are mutilated in the states, their foreskins are sold for profit and they have no explicit protections from the practice meanwhile FGM is seen as a separate, special kind of violence in 39 states. Men wanting more services when they have less even though they should have more are called misogynists who are stealing resources from women and researchers or activists who discover or say that DV is symmetrical are blacklisted (e.g, Straus, Pizzey, [Silverman who ended up killing himself after he opened up the FIRST male only shelter in Canada and was bullied to death by the government which denied him assistance as ""male victimisation is not sufficient enough to warrant the amount of protection and funding he needed""](https://youtu.be/Yt5BRcsOyy0), [see this as well](https://archive.is/3tqdV). The overwhelming majority of moral and psychological experiments also show violence against women is viewed as a more despicable and morally reprehensible phenomenon than violence against men (see [here](https://greenpill.net/male-disposability-the-evidence/)). So, yes, men are called ""selfish"" even though they are less protected from violence both legally and culturally. Who isn't? Those who demand more and more protection for women even at the expense of men and then call that male privilege when male victims are treated like second-class citizens not worthy of equal protection to assist them in times of need. 

&gt;My ability to make important decisions and my capability in general will never be questioned depending on what time of the month it is. 

My inability to take risks, be competent, make life or death decisions and be emotionally stable will be challenged more than a woman's regardless of what time of the month it is. 

&gt;The decision to hire me will never be based on assumptions about whether or not I might choose to have a family sometime soon.

The capacity of a man to provide for his wife and children or his future family can be taken into account in some hiring practices. 

&gt;Most major religions argue that I should be the head of my household, while my wife and children should be subservient to me. 

Feminists and their cherry-picking abilities. ""Husbands love your wives the way Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her (King James Bible)"", ""Husbands should love their wives the way Christ loved the church and gave his life for it"" (Contemporary English version). [Source ](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm). Yes, the Bible and other religions alike did tell women to be submissive to their husbands, but they also expected mutual and similar obligations of husbands. (the Bible being one example). Also, the term ""the head of the household"" is another word for a wage slave - as being the head of the household entails having to be fully financially liable for the support of your family. In some countries like Japan, women and men often take on traditional gender roles, but the [wife usually controls most of the budget while her husband is left with pocket money in spite of working more ](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19674306).

&gt;If I have children with a wife or girlfriend, chances are she'll do most of the childrearing, and in particular the most dirty, repetitive and unrewarding parts of childrearing.

[Historically and presently ](https://greenpill.net/marriage-as-economic-slavery/) men were and are pushed away from childrearing (in marriage and post-marriage due to custody problems). Women, on the other hand, are given a flexible option and the source shows the overwhelming majority of women choose and prefer flexibility to work life, so they end up doing more childcare and housework. In many countries, men struggle to get access to paternity leave and can't take on the caregiver role which is traditionally associated with women because they are expected to work. Feminists, as per usual, only give us half of the story which in fact shows women have more flexibility than men.

&gt;Magazines, billboards, television, movies, pornography, and virtually all of media is filled with imagines of scantily-clad women intended to appeal to me sexually. Such imagines of men exist, but are much rarer.

Of course that also ignores how often men are depicted as [deadbeats, irresponsible, clumsy, easily controlled, macho, incapable of being a decent parent, etc... ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/11/14/are-men-the-latest-victims-of-media-misrepresentation/?sh=32f72feb2caf) by many TV shows and commercials alike or how often the media [plays the sexual assault of men especially in prison and the sexual assault of men by women for laughs ](https://youtu.be/uc6QxD2_yQw). [This is a follow up video ](https://youtu.be/9nheskbsU5g). 

""But oh, well, we will only show you how attractive women are displayed on billboards to get men's dicks hard so companies can profit.""

&gt;If I am heterosexual, it's incredibly unlikely that I'll ever be beaten up by a spouse or lover.

Wrong, wrong. Just so wrong. 
- [This study ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407590073005) found women inflict severe violence on their partners more than men and men are more likely to sustain severe abuse. 
- [This study ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14113430_Gender_Differences_in_Partner_Violence_in_a_Birth_Cohort_of_21-Year-Olds_Bridging_the_Gap_Between_Clinical_and_Epidemiological_Approaches) found women are more likely to inflict severe violence on their partners than men are and men are more likely to sustain violent abuse. However, women reported being beaten up more (2.4% of women compared to 1.4% of men) than their male counterparts - men were much more likely to be kicked/bitten/hit with fists or an object and threatened with a knife/gun. They were also just as likely to experience the use of a knife/gun. 
- [The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey ](https://web.archive.org/web/20201017163043/http://www.batteredmen.com/) found that over 40% of victims of severe psychological and physical violence which includes being punched, kicked, etc... are men. 
- These studies and reviews ([here](https://bit.ly/3777wA6) and [here](https://bit.ly/34YT7V2)) find no evidence that women abuse in retaliation or self-defense or that women are less likely to strike the first blow/more likely to exercise violence in self-defense than men are. In fact, this [survey](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/in_brief_domestic_violence_not_always_one_sided) found 70% of one-sided abuse is committed by women and the majority of intimate partner violence is bilateral (committed by both partners) with women hitting first more often. This [blog post ](https://linearthinker.wordpress.com/2010/10/26/weighing-in-on-the-domestic-violence-debate-a-response-to-david-manboobz-futrelle/) responds to feminist claims on domestic abuse and criticism of the CTS scale. The claim that men are rarely abused by their partners and women are innocent victims who rarely commit intimate partner violence (just like the claim that men outside of prison are rarely raped and men are not discriminated against in hiring) comes from gender stereotypes which put women in a vulnerable position to men and such gender stereotypes are inherently advantageous to women as they lead to female victims of violence being believed and or taken seriously more often than male victims. 

&gt;On average, I am not interrupted by women as often as women are interrupted by men.

That darling oppression - being interrupted or letting others interrupt you due to your agreeableness and incapability of displaying dominance or assertiveness. Poor women. Here's an actual undeserved privilege: as a woman, your opinions will be rarely dismissed and called ""womansplaining"" purely because you are a woman. As a woman, you won't be accused of ""womanterrupting"" when you interrupt another woman or man while men will be accused of both, sometimes on [TV or in official settings ](https://youtu.be/TJyQpRfaGnw). 


&gt;As a child, chances are I got more teacher attention than girls who raised their hand just as often.

This ""male privilege"" is addressed in the book [The War Against Boys ](http://library.lol/main/859CC63453C4C0E6C7E7F2FF725972A2). Even if what was said is true, it's not necessarily evidence of actual discriminaton against girls as it could be caused by a multitude of factors including the fact that girls outperform boys, are the majority of A students, get better grades on average, are more likely to attend higher education and are less likely to be subjected to punishment for their behavior, so naturally when a boy raises his hand, teachers might be inclined to pick him instead because he rarely gets the chance to talk or show his skills. The idea of ""male privilege"" in the classroom is laughable, almost as laughable as saying violence against women is taken less seriously than violence against men (which is what you did not so long ago) once one looks at the stats on who is getting the upper hand and overacheiving. Before somebody stops me and says ""but that outcome is a consequence of girls working harder than boys"", well no, it isn't. Boys and girls actually get identical grades, if not boys outperform girls on subjects traditionally associated with masculinity such as mathematics and science, but are systemically downgraded on teacher assessments which causes them to underperform and be discouraged from competing alongside girls. Teacher bias is a strong predictor for the disparities in achievement between the sexes ([here](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/496867), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775713000782), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775718307714?via%3Dihub), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272708000418?via%3Dihub), [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2019.1646862?journalCode=rael20), [here](https://www.ipp.eu/en/news/a-helping-hand-for-girls-gender-bias-in-marks-and-its-effect-on-student-progress/), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775716304526?via%3Dihub) and [here](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0036620)). [92% of sex-selective scholarships are reserved for women, too ](https://www.thecollegefix.com/92-percent-of-sex-specific-scholarships-are-reserved-for-women-study-finds/) and the [system sides with female complaints of discrimination more than it does with male complaints](https://archive.vn/649JL) in almost every sector - from grading discrimination to the denial of due process rights to accused men. Some schools admit to gender bias such as [this one ](http://imgur.com/a/hVc8sf4). Additionally, [this study  ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230871109_Investing_in_Children_Changes_in_Parental_Spending_on_Children_1972-2007) which analysed economic spending on children's education by parents from 1972 to 2007 found that parents spend more on girls' education than boys' education and [this article ](https://archive.is/Q6LoP) explores the relationship between gender stereotypes and the suppression of boy behavior which is deemed to be aggressive in schools. Could disruptive behavior explain part of the disparity in achievement? Yes, but it doesn't dispute the existence of bias either. It is rather simplistic to look at disruptive behavior as ""boys doing it to themselves"" when such behavior can be caused by factors which are outside of boys' control such as [family breakdowns](https://archive.is/cOUxS) as well as single parenthood and the lack of a father figure at home which might impact boys differently than girls. [This 2008 report from HRW ](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2008/us0808/8.htm) also found that in places where corporal punishment is still practiced or was practiced, boys were subject to punishment disproportionately to girls and while it would be irrational to attribute all of the disparity to bias, it would be no surprise if bias played a role in it. The article notes: ""One high school teacher suggested one possible reason for the gender disparity in paddling, noting that at her school it was common practice to ‚Äústay away from hitting the girls. I guess they‚Äôre more fragile, and a lot of them could be pregnant and we wouldn‚Äôt know it.‚Äù A father of two boys and a girl felt that it was more acceptable for boys to be paddled than girls. He explained, ‚ÄúMy little girl‚Äîdon‚Äôt you put your hands on her‚Ä¶. As far as my boys, I am super hard on them. For one, they are young black men and they are faced with different obstacles in life. I get on them every day, and I know they say, ‚ÄòMan, my dad is tough."" Many interviewees reported that boys were beaten more harshly than girls. A middle school boy in Mississippi observed that one of his teachers ‚Äúpaddle the boys real hard and when he paddled the girls he don‚Äôt really hit them.‚Äù One student reported that there are smaller paddles for girls: ‚ÄúThey use a short one for girls and a long one for the boys.""¬†

I don't like it when male circumcision is compared to female genital mutilation,"I'm circumcised, and I'm very much against male circumcision, but female genital mutilation is a lot worse than male circumcision is, and so they are not the same thing.

For example, most male circumcisions are done in hospitals or sterile environment with clean medical cutting tools, while most female genital mutilations are done out in the open with dirty non-medical cutting tools (like hunting knives or sometimes a piece of glass even).

Also, female genital mutilation usually takes away most sexual pleasure from a woman, while men can still feel a lot of sexual pleasure after a circumcision. Most of the clitoris (or at least a lot of it) is removed from female genital mutilation, while only the foreskin is removed from a male circumcision. The equivalent to removing the whole clitoris in males would be removing the whole glans of the penis, and the equivalent to removing the foreskin in females would be the clitoral hood.

I read somewhere that male circumcision isn't near as damaging as even the less extreme forms of female genital mutilation is. I'm not sure if that's true or not. ",74,0

How can I approach this issue in dating?","I took a break from dating for a span of 2 years to focus on my career, my life, and other things important to me, and generally stayed away from political matters despite living in a very progressive area of America. 

Two years ago, I don't remember ever having a conversation about women's rights, feminism, the pay gap, or anything to do with how women have it ""harder"" than men with any of the women I was dating. But now, as I'm reconnecting with female ""friends"" and going on dates with women more and more, I keep hearing them bring up women's issues. **Did something change? What happened? Is it because I'm now in my mid/late 20s? Is it because it's primarily online dating?**

--------

As for my opinions on this, I find it wildly inappropriate to bring up politics on dates, and even more so, to bring up politics that is centered around telling someone how privileged a group that they were born into is and how they comparably have it far easier. I would never tell a woman how much easier they have it in regard to homelessness, prison rates, prison sentencing, suicides, child support, alimony, domestic abuse support, dating, sex, etc. because that's not only rude but also unproductive to the goal of dating. I want to focus on areas that I can control and act as a good person, rather than complain to others about things that are not wholly in my control. Yet, almost complete strangers have no qualms with bringing up issues to me in regards to my gender. 

I'm worried because something I never noticed before is now so pervasive in my experience of the dating market. A few years ago, I never noticed any of the women I was dating to ever bring up gender issues, and, now, a whole lot of them bring it up either subliminally or directly. **How can I expect all these individuals that believe that women have it so much harder to ever contribute as equally to my growth and development in a relationship as I will to theirs?**

-----

Frankly, the more and more I hear from women about the ""hardships"" women exclusively face, the more and more biased I become against those viewpoints, especially given that any conversation regarding the validity of certain viewpoints usually ends in emotional tantrums. Right now, I know this is bad, but when I hear someone talk about women having more problems in certain areas, I feel like I'm listening to a spoiled kid complaining how a ""make-a-wish"" kid they know gets to see their favorite celebrity. 

I definitely realize I'm hitting a point where I'm totally unreceptive and apathetic towards any feminist/women's issue. **Is there any place where I can have a genuine, non-emotional conversation with women on their issues?** I'd like to be more open than I am currently, but a lot of the points I hear are either false or steeped in emotional backdrop.

"The earliest identified occupational cancer affected the testicles of prepubescent boy chimney sweeps in Victorian era England. They lived short, terrible lives and rarely reached adulthood.","One thing I haven't seen discussed very much is the long history of boys being used for some truly terrible jobs throughout history.

One of those jobs was the chimney sweep.  They used young boys because they were both small enough to go inside chimneys and because they were disposable enough to be made to do it.

Not only was this a terrible job to perform, but the earliest example of an occupational cancer was identified in chimney sweepers. The cancer affected their testicles and started out as a sore on the outside of the scrotum known as ""soot wart"". A combination of cancer, lung diseases, and other medical problems meant that most never lived to be 18, or were disabled before they became adults.

The phrase *""to light a fire under someone""* originated from this practice.  If the chimney sweeper was taking too long, they would start a fire in the fireplace to make him work faster.

It was also common for them to get stuck or lost in chimney mazes. Chimneys used to have branches between different buildings that were difficult to navigate. And they would let the boys die from dehydration or asphyxiation before they would destroy the chimney to get them out.

There was such a high demand for boy chimney sweepers that families would sell their sons into what was essentially slavery for extra cash.

In India they still use boys to mine certain shafts that are too small for adults to fit in.

The term delivery boy (and it's negative connotation) likely shares a common heritage with other ""boy occupations"" that we forced boys to do.

Child labor laws were originally implemented because people became appalled at the working and living conditions of chimney sweeps (who often walked around in soot covered rags because that's all they were given to wear).  Those laws largely went ignored for hundreds of years though because enforcement was sparse.

Even today, these jobs tend to be performed by men. Conditions, and pay, are obviously better. But many traditional male occupations are looked down on as ""lower class"" even if the pay is comparatively better to the more comfortable jobs that women perform.  It's ""men's work"" which somehow makes it lower in prestige, and less desirable, than ""women's work"".

Here's a short video about chimney sweepers and a couple Wikipedia articles:

What's the deal with that one website?,"Hi all. Had to word the title that way because of reddit. I wanted to stop by and ask about [mgtow.com](https://mgtow.com). I would've asked on the mgtow reddit, but of course reddit has banned that sub. Naturally this place is a logical second choice. 

Did it get bought out by the femminist corporate overlords that we're at war with? You can't sign up on their forums, and I keep reading things like ""Nothing ever came of [mgtow.com](https://mgtow.com)"" and ""[Mgtow.com](https://Mgtow.com) is basically dead"".

Is this the case? Is there anything actually wrong with that site? Or is it functioning normally, and maybe it's just ran by incompetent people? If there is a real problem, I might be interested in starting up some variant of it and marketing it properly, about a year from now. It would of course need to make money, but the real reason I'd want to do it, would be so that I could funnel money to men's rights causes. I'm interested in so many of them, but one of them might be campaign contributions to friendly politicians. 

The site could be a means of raising/earning money towards that end. If anyone is unfamiliar with the idea, the quick and dirty is this: You find a politician known to be sympathetic to a particular men's rights issue or cause. You say that you'd be interested in making a campaign contribution in the amount of x, but you'd first like to know how they're going to vote on the upcoming issue of x. They want the money, and they'll pledge to vote your way. They know they're expected to. And they might not have otherwise, having perhaps some other incentive not to, even though they are sympathetic to the cause. But now they've been paid. Yeah it's messed up but that's how our system works. And it's what our opposition does constantly, so we'd better do it to if we hope to accomplish any of our goes and effect real social and legal change. 

So it would be very helpful to me if someone could tell me what's really going on with the website [Mgtow.com](https://Mgtow.com). Thanks!

Men hitting women,"&amp;#x200B;

So I thought about why men can't hit women and the reason is obviously that on average males pose such a huge physical advantage over women that hitting them is completely unfair which makes sense however I'm fairly average size and strength so someone like DK Metcalf or Lebron James would hold the same physical advantage over me the same way I do over women (on average)

So here's the scenario if I ran into a woman who threw water on me spat on me threw food in my face and violated and disrespected me if I was to hit her I would be criticized however if I did the same thing to DK Metcalf in a bar and he fucked me up there would be no issue people would say ""I had it coming!""

What I mean is how this fair, she gets to be disrespectful and nothing happens but if did it I would be on the ground getting violated.

Quick rant,"Had a conversation with a female best friend earlier this week. We saw a news report about a woman who got sexually assaulted down in Florida (terrible what happened to her). I said to her that this type of stuff should never happen to a man or a woman. She says ‚Äúmen don‚Äôt get sexually assaulted, they normally like it when they touch them.‚Äù (She‚Äôs for equality btw).  I said ‚Äúreally? If a guy came up to you, grabbed your bits, and told you you knew you liked it, even though you told them to get off, would it not count as sexual assault?‚Äù

She then says to me ‚Äúyeah it would! A man should never put his hands on a woman! Especially when it comes to sexual assault‚Äù. I told her ‚ÄúWhat you said goes against your views for equality‚Äù. ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù She says. I told her ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt believe that sexual assault can happen to anyone, even men, then you do not want equality. Many men don‚Äôt come out about their assaults, because they don‚Äôt get taken seriously/they‚Äôre laughed at.‚Äù 

We got into a heated argument for about 2 hours, and now I‚Äôm currently blocked. Haven‚Äôt heard from her since Monday.

TLDR: my friend didn‚Äôt believe men could get assaulted, I told her we could, and she didn‚Äôt believe me and got mad.",24,0

I have always been bothered by certain cliche and stereotype even since i was little and very ignorant of life,like men not being able to cook and clean,being inconsiderate,a girl can do anything a man can,etc.. etc..,so maybe i was predisposed to it. I have have watched many sides of this discussion: the one that wants a return to traditional values,the one that bashes women and feminism,the one that focus on legal rights,the one more concerned with men rather than women,the one that tangentially touched this arguments because of media and games,the one outside of time and space,that focus more on the true nature of humans and relationships and so on. I have thought of doing something myself,become an activist. I have raised the issues with family,friends and schoolmates,but never on a serious level. Partly because i live in a different, traditional country,and some of the feminist arguments can be argued. Partly for my ignorance on the argument. Partly for the fact that i cannot feel intellectually honest,since i have a great deal of anger toward women,for legitimate and illegitimate reasons,and i sometimes doubts of the legitimacy of certain claims. But,i have started to see signs of the USA feminism appear in my country.

## ALERT:¬†Contact¬†Florida Governor¬†Ron¬†DeSantis

#### Ask The Governor Why Florida Is Failing To Provide Proper¬†Care For Minor Male Victims of Sex Trafficking

Dear Friends of USIAHT,  


We need your help to ensure that the Florida Department of Children &amp; Families (DCF) places male victims of sex trafficking under the age of 18 at¬†USIAHT's Florida Safe Home. ¬†  


üì∑Florida DCF identified 376 male youth victims between 2017-2019, while USIAHT's Florida safe home provided care for only 19 victims during that period.¬†  


This means Florida has failed to deliver safe home trauma/restorative treatment to over 350 young Florida boys identified as victims of sex trafficking in the last three years, and as a result, our home has operated on average at 50% capacity since opening in 2016.

"An attempt to explain why ""women are wonderful""","&gt; The women-are-wonderful effect is the phenomenon found in psychological and sociological research which suggests that people associate more positive attributes with women compared to men. (Wikipedia)

The reason the Wikipedia article gives is: ""the association between women and nurturing characteristics""  (plus typical feminist craziness that I'm gonna bypass here). Yeah, it can be that it has something to do with mothers, if that's what the article means. But because that's a bit unsatisfactory - we all know all kinds of women, not just our mothers - I decided to develop a better explanation by contemplating the question for about 15 minutes.

I think it really comes down to how women's faces look. Seriously. Women's faces look different form men's faces in two ways: 1) they are more childlike and 2) they are on average more average and, thus, more attractive. 

First, we all, okay, most agree that children are wonderful. If they weren't we wouldn't want to do almost anything for them, if they are our own, and a lot even when they aren't. The same mechanisms that evolution ""designed"" to protect and help children certainly play a role when we look at or think about women. The effect fades as the years go by but rarely totally.

Second, women are indeed better-looking than men. That's not only because many have those cute childlike features. It's also because good looks actually mean mostly being average. And women are more average because of that ""extra"" chromosome (or some other reason, you tell me) probably in every way, also when it comes to the symmetry and other average feature of faces. Makeup helps to highlight the ordinariness (if that's not a paradox).

And here's something you perhaps didn't know: our brains are hardwired to think that more attractive looking people are also more honest, clever, and kind. You can read more from Robert M. Sapolsky's brilliant book *Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst*. Unfortunately, I don't have the book at hand, so I can't give the exact page numbers, but he discusses it at least twice  - without making the connection to women, though. 

So, now you know.

Men in courts and rape cases are guilty until proven innocent,"i saw a article today about a guy called jaxon lister who allegedly raped 20 girls anyways they reported it to the police and wanted the school to suspend him , get kicked out of his team and lose his scholarships and now there is a petition signed by 500k people to through him in jail 

i dont care about this guy specifically he could be actually guilts but just look how people are willing to believe the girls and want to ruin his life EVEN THO THERE IS NO PROOF and this happen to most people who are wrongly or falsely  accused nobody care even if the court proofed your innocence

Woman cause life is easier for women. The women I know in aggregate live better lives than the men I know and the people I know with the best lives are all women. I want the constant validation and self-esteem boosts that comes with being a woman. I want the ease women have when it comes to dating and finding love.

The female antagonist in the Columbo-series always has a good reason to kill the male victim (spoiler alert!),"I love the Columbo series but after watching it for the 10th time I noticed a sad phenomenon. When the murderer Columbo is after is a female then it always turns out that she killed the male victim to serve justice or to protect herself and others from the evil wrongdoings of the male victim. Columbo always takes a pity on female murderers and treats them differently than male murderers. Examples (spoilers):   
 

Season 8 episode 3: The murderer is dr. Joan Allenby and the victim is her boyfriend, David Kincaid. She kills Kincaid because he cheats on her. When Columbo finally catches her she pleads that there isn't a woman on Earth who wouldn't have considered killing a cheater. Again, it's hinted that the victim deserved to die and the real victim is the woman because now she has to go to prison for murder.   
  

Season 7 episode 3: The murderer is Kay Freestone, the victim is Mark Macandrews. Mark is Kay's abusive boss and lover. When Kay wants to leave him he threatens to ruin her career if she leaves. The abusive male victim deserved to die. Again. The ending dialogue hints that she will fight in court because the murder was justified by Mark's abuse.   
  

Season 6 episode 2: The murderer is Ruth Lytton, the victims are Janie Brandt's father, Ruth's brother Edward Lytton and the security guard. It turns out that she killed Janie's father because he was a monster and killed her own brother because he wanted to sell the museum she loved. The guard was a criminal in and out of prison so he was yet another negative male character. After the truth unravels Columbo hushes up the truth about the murder of Janie's father because he takes pity on these women. The viewer is pressured to feel like the men deserved to die.   


Season 7 episode 1: The murderer is Abigail Mitchell, the victim is Edmund Galvin. It turns out that she murdered Edmund (portrayed as a useless playboy) because she suspected that he killed her niece a few years back. It was never proven that he actually did it, just hinted by the murderer. Again the viewer was made to feel like the victim actually deserved to die a horrible death and the murderer is just an old lady who wanted justice. Her justice.   


Season 5 episode 1: The murderer is Grace Wheeler Willis, the victim is dr. Henry Willis, the husband. The husband doesn't want to give a bunch of money for his wife's new play so she kills him and makes it look like a suicide. It turns out that the murderer is actually suffering from a fatal illness and doesn't even remember committing the murder so Columbo takes pity on her and doesn't arrest her, since she will (probably) die soon anyway. Nobody gives two fucks about the male victim, he is considered an asshole because he refused to give his wife the money she needed. It also turns out that Grace married him for his money. So the gold digger gets away with murder.   


Season 3 episode 1: The murderer is Viveca Scott, the victim is Karl Lessing and Shirley Blaine. Karl is a thief who stole a formula from Viveca's beauty company and wants to ruin her with it. She tries to negotiate with him but he refuses and even humiliates her so she kills him in a moment of rage. Shirley finds out and tries to extort money from Viveca so she gets killed as well. Again the woman is portrayed as the victim and the man portrayed as the real criminal who deserved to die.   


  Season 1 episode 5: The murderer is Beth Chadwich and the victim is her brother, Bryce Chadwick. Beth's life is controlled by abusive men, first her father and then her brother. When her brother tries to chase away her love interest she decides to kill him. In the end the viewer feels like that she was the real victim of the men who abused her all her life.   


Probably the only episode where the woman is a true psychotic murderer is Season 9 episode 4: Rest in peace, Mrs. Columbo. The rest of the episodes featuring female criminals are all wired to feel sorry for women and to hate the male victims.

I know it's just a silly series but 50 years later people still feel the same and it's sad.",17,0
Another misandrist article musing about what to do with 'excess' males,"[https://archive.vn/gaKZw](https://archive.vn/gaKZw)

Key areas of the article relevant to/dismissing people concerned about male issues

""Men‚Äôs  rights advocates have often attempted to weaponize facts like  these  against feminism, on the basis that men ‚Äúhave it worse‚Äù than  women. But  male expendability and female subjugation are two sides of  the same  coin. The same logic that keeps women and their sexuality under  jealous  guard and treats them as a prize to be awarded is also what  casts the  majority of men into a Hobbesian struggle for that prize‚Äîensuring   continued reproduction of a social order gov¬≠erned by a predominantly   male elite. Contrary to both traditionalist conservative myth and   popular feminist narrative, for most of history patriarchy was not a   privilege one benefited from simply by being born male, but a brutal   racket in which millions of men destroyed each other and the world   around them for the benefit of a fortunate few.""

""If   the consequences were limited to an occasional unhinged manifesto and a   few more entries in the depressingly frequent list of mass shoot¬≠ings,   we could perhaps content ourselves with occasionally mocking incels   while ignoring them the rest of the time. But they are only the tip of   the iceberg. Given that incels tend to be drawn from white (or   white-adjacent) portions of the suburban and exurban middle class, there   is a tendency to dismiss their predicament as one of privilege and   entitlement. Yet it is also possible to see them as a local variant of a   global crisis of masculinity that unites their fates with those of  less  ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù men. In the United States, men make up over 90  percent of  the prison population. In [South Sudan](https://archive.vn/o/gaKZw/https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2017/12/19/the-link-between-polygamy-and-war), the combination of polygamy and bride prices has contributed directly to civil war. [ISIS](https://archive.vn/o/gaKZw/https://womenintheworld.com/2016/05/24/isis-recruits-young-syrians-with-the-promise-of-wives-from-the-womens-market/) has recruited frustrated Muslim men with the promise of wives. In countries like [East Germany](https://archive.vn/o/gaKZw/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/world/europe/merkel-east-germany-nationalists-populism.html),   the disproportionate emi¬≠gration of women better adapted to seek work   in Western cities has left behind a population of angry men who form  the  primary base for Far Right movements. And in India, the same   phenomenon, exacerbated by a gender imbalance stemming from   sex-selective abortion, has [exploded](https://archive.vn/o/gaKZw/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/we-dont-have-any-fear-indias-angry-young-men-and-its-lynch-mob-crisis/2018/08/26/9a0a247a-a0aa-11e8-a3dd-2a1991f075d5_story.html) into a violent religious fanaticism. As the [*Economist*](https://archive.vn/o/gaKZw/https://www.economist.com/essay/2015/05/28/men-adrift) writes, ‚ÄúThe world‚Äôs most dysfunctional people are nearly all male.‚Äù

Understood   in this way, the incel‚Äôs predicament is a bitterly ironic one. For in   addition to the targets of their rage, incels victimize themselves by   supporting the very same ideologies that lie at the root of their   immiseration. They decry the materialism and shallowness of   ‚Äúgold-digging‚Äù women who only care about men‚Äôs wealth and social status   while in the same breath opposing feminist equality and upholding the   gender norms that enshrine men as providers. They extol marriage while   opposing the sorts of economic redistributionist policies that would   make it easier for men like them to attain and sustain it. They adopt   white supremacist ideologies that demonize black and immigrant men   instead of recognizing their common plight. And with their view of   history hopelessly distorted by consumer media, they pine for [‚Äútraditional‚Äù eras](https://archive.vn/o/gaKZw/https://americanmind.org/post/wat-iz-bronze-age-mindset/)   in which, in all statistical likeli¬≠hood, they would find themselves   serving as cannon fodder in some lord‚Äôs army, wasting away from scurvy   at sea, or hauling stones under an overseer‚Äôs whip. But one need not   have any sympathy for incels to recognize that simply admonishing them   to ‚Äúbe better‚Äù and less entitled is an inadequate response to a   confluence of technological and demographic change, and that the   conditions that breed them create a more dangerous world for us all.""",38,0

I think the occurrence of false rape cases are much much higher than what is reported.,"Lately, i've been thinking about it . And I have come to conclusion that false rape cases against men occur much much more than what is reported.

Firstly, they simply don't report the real number because it hurts their propaganda. Secondly, the technicalities aspect of ""reports"" make it so that even when someone wants to publish honestly, it's nearly impossible. If for some reason the court punishes a man for rape even when everyone knows it's false, the technicalities make it so that one has to report it as a genuine case of rape or it could simply be labeled as misinformation. If you think this doesn't occur often, just look at Johnny Depp's case. Man lost the case despite having all the evidences. Up until a few years ago men couldn't expect any legal support as a victim of rape (and many of countries even today). And when you do break the norm and try to ask help, many men are denied of any legal help.",21,0

Something we can do instead of banning male neonatal circumcision.,"I can see a ban on circumcision would be much harder than passing a law banning the creation of products from human flesh. Human flesh cannot be legally sold, but products created from them can. Hospitals can illegally sell the foreskin away instead of disposing of it as medical waste, since there's no way they're going to get caught, and profit 100k$ per baby foreskin.

Who does this money go towards? Not the children who were circumcised, not the parents of the baby circumcised, but to line some sadistic fatcats pockets.

My conclusion I've come to is this if we ban the use of human flesh to make products, then circumcision rates will plummet. Hospitals and doctors only push for it to be done so they can sell the flesh illegally. Hell, they're making 100k$ per circumcision, so why wouldn't they push for it? Profit-driven and unnecessary procedures could be stopped dead in their tracks.",20,0

How to become the best version of myself at 17?,"Yo!, I‚Äôm currently in my senior year of high school and discovered the red pill last year from watching Stephiscold, AMS, and Mjgetright. Before watching them I was a skinny-fat loser but after I transitioned myself into a pretty nice physique, quit porn and masturbation, raised my GPA and increased my skills in drone flying and computer science, and been accepted into colleges. I‚Äôve gone through some pretty shitty things at my high school like multiple girls calling me ugly, dudes hating me, and getting rejected a thousand times. After applying the self-improvement knowledge, however, greatly raised my attraction levels and noticed some girls interested in me. Even though I‚Äôm constantly improving myself I‚Äôm a virgin and girls still leave me on seen a lot. I‚Äôve kinda adopted a new philosophy that I generally don‚Äôt need a girlfriend and will use my energy to build up my skills, but it is still lonely lol. It kinda sucks seeing all the dudes who don‚Äôt do shit but smoke weed pulls all the girls whereas I just stay at home studying and programming. Strangely, it almost motivates me to become better than them. My question is, how can I continue to build myself into a greater version so I live a well-fulfilled life?",1,1

Talking with Girls isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúMaking Progress‚Äù,"A mate of mine recently mentioned to me that he‚Äôs had a couple girls he‚Äôs been messaging on Tinder for a month and it hasn‚Äôt led anywhere ‚Äì they haven‚Äôt wanted to actually meet up with him for a date, even after weeks and weeks of conversation.

God damn is that relatable ‚Äì most of us have wasted weeks talking to a girl, only for her to eventually stop responding seemingly out of nowhere. I‚Äôve had this happen a million times since the days I was a lonely horny teenager chatting on MSN Messenger to girls in random chatrooms (who were probably 45yo men). I‚Äôve been ghosted/had girls disappear more times than your mum has had ‚Äúgentleman callers‚Äù.

It hurts because the more time you spend chatting to a girl, the more you become invested in her. You start thinking, ‚ÄúI like this girl, she‚Äôs got some cool hobbies, she seems like a nice person, we vibe well, we‚Äôve shared some inside jokes, I‚Äôm attracted to her. I want to meet her.‚Äú

Which just makes it even more frustrating/painful when you don‚Äôt end up meeting ‚Äì not only have you wasted a bunch of time, but you were emotionally-invested in her too.

Girls are Like a Leaf on the Wind

Call me an ace detective, but in my 30+ years on this Earth I‚Äôve been able to figure out that girls can be pretty damn finicky at times ‚Äì what they want changes from second to second, like leaves being blown around by the wind. Hell, they can change their minds about things mid-sentence. The longer you spend chatting to a girl without pushing for a meetup/sex, the more chance she‚Äôll be turned off by something you say, or will get bored of your go-nowhere conversation.

It could be literally anything that puts her off, and it‚Äôs completely random and arbitrary. Girls have been put off by me saying the weirdest shit ‚Äì and it changes from girl to girl. One girl will love if I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really into tennis.‚Äù Another girl might decide it‚Äôs a boring sport and just suddenly lose interest in talking to me. (Who doesn‚Äôt like tennis though? Fuck her.)

Not to mention it‚Äôs damn hard to keep a conversation interesting and engaging for any long period of time. The longer you talk, the more you‚Äôre making it harder on yourself by trying to entertain her with your ‚Äúwitty banter‚Äù and ‚Äúkiller lines‚Äù.

‚ÄúBut Andy, you total goose, you‚Äôre wrong! I don‚Äôt mind talking to girls for weeks, because I‚Äôm practicing my conversation skills &amp; that will help me bang other girls!‚Äù

Nah. Spending ages talking to a girl doesn‚Äôt make you more likely to bang other girls ‚Äì you‚Äôre not ‚Äúgetting good at talking to girls‚Äù. You‚Äôre only getting good at wasting your own time.

Generally speaking, the less talking you do before having sex, the better. Which is why you should always push for a meetup (and sex) as early as possible, and work on building a connection/talking/learning about each other‚Äôs hobbies/etc after you‚Äôve smushed your private parts together. Do the dirty deed first, and then do the talking.

You can‚Äôt fully know a person until after you‚Äôve had sex with them anyway. Before that, she‚Äôll be holding up a mask, trying to make a good first impression and not say anything to put you off. After you bang, you‚Äôll both be much more relaxed, since you‚Äôve already been intimate.

Talking is much more enjoyable after you‚Äôve just fucked each other‚Äôs brains out ‚Äì there‚Äôs something really nice about basking in the afterglow together, her lying on your sweaty chest, the two of you chatting the night away. There‚Äôs no tension, no nervousness, no expectations. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ nice.

Sometimes It‚Äôs not Her Fault ‚Äì Sometimes You‚Äôre Cockblocking Yourself

Oftentimes a girl literally wants to meet up with you, but you‚Äôre cockblocking yourself. You‚Äôre carrying on these long ‚ÄúHi how are you today?‚Äù conversations over weeks because you‚Äôre too scared to pull the trigger and actually invite her out for a date. I get it ‚Äì I used to be terrified to actually make the move I knew I had to make, because it sets you up for possible rejection. And the longer you‚Äôve been talking to the girl, the less you‚Äôll be able to handle her saying, ‚ÄúNo thanks, I don‚Äôt want to meet‚Äù.

So you drag out conversations, hoping if you just keep talking to her either:

a) She‚Äôll eventually invite you out for a date (which almost never happens ‚Äì girls aren‚Äôt the ones who make the moves 99% of the time); or

b) You‚Äôll keep making ‚Äúprogress‚Äù and eventually you‚Äôll feel more at ease and will be able to make the move yourself.

The issue is, those two things rarely happen. Girls don‚Äôt make the move (it‚Äôs not their job to do so ‚Äì it‚Äôs yours). And it‚Äôs entirely likely you feel less able to make a move the more you talk to a girl, because the longer you delay doing so, the more nervous you‚Äôll become. The more you procrastinate asking her out, the more of a big deal you‚Äôre making it out to be, and the less likely you‚Äôll follow through and actually do it.

This is probably something you‚Äôve never considered, but I‚Äôve had countless girls talk to me about how hurt they are that a guy they liked never actually ended up asking her out on a date. Or, they‚Äôll go on a few dates, but he‚Äôll never actually make a move and try to kiss her and have sex with her. Girls are always incredibly hurt by this. They‚Äôll literally meet up with their closest girl friends, sit down at a cafe somewhere, let out a big sigh and ask, ‚ÄúDo you guys think I‚Äôm ugly? There‚Äôs this guy that hasn‚Äôt made a move on me yet.‚Äù

Girls absolutely hate it when a guy doesn‚Äôt make a move when he‚Äôs had ample opportunity ‚Äì if enough time passes, she‚Äôll start feeling like you‚Äôre not really that into her. It‚Äôll feel like a rejection to her. You‚Äôre literally hurting a girl‚Äôs feelings ‚Äì and insulting her femininity/attractiveness ‚Äì if you never make a move on her. You‚Äôre putting her in the friendzone.

If you continue not making a move, at some point she‚Äôll have had enough and will pragmatically decide not to see you for another date.

Girls want you to make a move on them. So stop wasting time talking, and just be direct and assertive &amp; make a move.

The Danger: You Think You‚Äôre Making Progress when You‚Äôre Talking to a Girl

You need to start being more pragmatic and not letting yourself waste time talking to girls for ages ‚Äì for your own personal sanity, if for nothing else. Because, you‚Äôre essentially breaking your own heart every time you talk to a girl for a month and don‚Äôt end up meeting her.

And that‚Äôs something you‚Äôve engineered ‚Äì you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs decided to talk to her for a month. You‚Äôve built up this romantic idea that the two of you ‚Äúvibe‚Äù and you‚Äôre ‚Äúcompatible‚Äù and meeting would be ‚Äúamazing‚Äù. Truth be told guys are the real romantics ‚Äì we‚Äôre the ones who build up these idealised notions of how great it would be to meet this one particular girl. We get invested in the idea of her, and get swept up in the romance of it all. It‚Äôs all in your head ‚Äì she‚Äôs likely nothing special (none of us are all that special ‚Äì there‚Äôs 8 billion of us), and you‚Äôd benefit from cutting your losses and finding the next girl.

The worst thing of all is you think you‚Äôre making progress just because you‚Äôre talking to a girl. All you‚Äôre really doing is saying words to a girl and she‚Äôs saying words back to you. I know it feels like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting closer to this girl, we‚Äôre getting to know each other better, I‚Äôm learning her likes and dislikes, we‚Äôre having funny conversations, I‚Äôm getting her more comfortable with me and she‚Äôll be comfortable meeting up with me soon. I‚Äôm getting closer and closer to having sex with her.‚Äú

All of that is something you‚Äôve invented in your head though ‚Äì none of it is necessarily true. If she hasn‚Äôt met you within a week or two &amp; has declined meeting with you (this assumes you‚Äôve, you know, actually invited her out for a date) then she has no intention of meeting you. You‚Äôre not making any progress with her, and worse ‚Äì you‚Äôre actually moving backwards. Time you‚Äôre wasting chatting with her is time you could be spending with other girls.

And in the cases where it‚Äôs your fault ‚Äì as in, you haven‚Äôt actually asked her out on a date ‚Äì you‚Äôre sending her the message that you‚Äôre not really serious about meeting up, and are happy to just waste time chatting online/via text. You‚Äôre creating a situation in which your time will almost certainly be wasted.

Look, I get it ‚Äì cutting a girl off or risking rejection by actually asking her out on a date after weeks of chatting hurts. It‚Äôs the ‚Äúsunken cost fallacy‚Äù ‚Äì you feel like you‚Äôve invested a tonne of time and you don‚Äôt want that to have been for nothing. It feels like you‚Äôve been building something with this girl, and cutting it off can seem a bit harsh. ‚ÄúAndy, you‚Äôre overreacting ‚Äì I‚Äôm happy to keep chatting to this girl, because there‚Äôs still a small chance she‚Äôll meet me.‚Äù

**You have to let that go.** There‚Äôs a 5% chance she‚Äôll meet you after wasting more weeks/months of your time ‚Äì those are terrible odds. But if you go talk to 20 more women, it‚Äôs basically guaranteed you‚Äôll meet up with one or a couple of them for a date (and likely even have sex with them if you make a move).

If you want further proof right from the horse‚Äôs mouth, here‚Äôs a post by a female on the Tinder subreddit:

""...been off tinder for ages now, but there's this guy i started talking to a week ago, had a really great conversation, he's moving here soon, etc. we messaged back and forth for like for hours straight, it was fun. ***i'm not crazy about meeting him because i'm not sure i'm really attracted to him*** enough to do that...""

So this poor sap has been talking to her for a week, and at one point for four hours straight ‚Äì the whole time thinking to himself, ‚ÄúThis girl is awesome! We‚Äôre vibing, she really likes me, I really like her a lot ‚Äì I‚Äôm making so much progress!‚Äú

The whole time she has absolutely no intention of meeting him, but is happy to keep wasting his time.

The Solution

You need to be trying to get girls out on dates and then trying to have sex with them.

That is your goal.

It is your only goal.

Don‚Äôt worry about trying to ‚Äúmake the girl like you‚Äù or ‚Äúforming a connection‚Äù or ‚Äúbuilding rapport‚Äù. Just get her out on a date, ASAP. The date is when you actually get to know someone properly, so save the conversation for face-to-face.

If there‚Äôs any girls you‚Äôve been talking to for days/weeks and it‚Äôs not really going anywhere, do this:

1. Get the girl‚Äôs number with: ‚ÄúYou seem cool, we should grab a drink. What‚Äôs your number?‚Äù
2. Once you have her number, text her a hello &amp; immediately pitch a meetup. ‚ÄúFree tomorrow night at 6pm?‚Äù
3. If she says she‚Äôs busy, pitch another time + date.
4. If she‚Äôs busy then too, pitch a third time + date.
5. If she says no to your third attempt, say: ‚ÄúAll good, sounds like you‚Äôre super busy. I‚Äôm not going to keep chasing you, so when you‚Äôre free, shoot me a message and we‚Äôll organise something.‚Äù Most of the time the girl will never text you, which is great ‚Äì you‚Äôve gotten rid of a timewaster.

If you‚Äôve sent the final message to a girl &amp; a few days/weeks later she sends a message that seems like she‚Äôs just wasting your time again ‚Äì eg she says a simple ‚ÄúHi‚Äù or ‚ÄúGood morning‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your day going?‚Äù, reply with ‚ÄúHey. Ready to meet up now?‚Äù If she‚Äôs still non-committal &amp; won‚Äôt agree to a date, she‚Äôs even more of a timewaster than we originally thought. Block/unmatch her immediately and move on. Life‚Äôs too short to waste time on girls who have no intention of ever meeting up with you, &amp; who show active disrespect for your time.

And going forward, for new girls you talk to, follow the exact steps above. When you match with or meet a new girl, chat to her for a couple of messages (no more than 3 messages), then do steps 1-5 above. Remember, you‚Äôre not trying to ‚Äúform a connection‚Äù over text, you‚Äôre trying to get her out on a date ‚Äì that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll form your connection.

Once you‚Äôre out on a date, don‚Äôt waste time in overly-long conversations there either. Talk for a bit until you‚Äôre both somewhat comfortable and like each other, then make a move on her. Hold her hand, try to kiss her, give her a cuddle, tell her to link arms with you as you walk, make out with her, play with her ‚Äì touch her in some way. It doesn‚Äôt really matter what you do, but do something that isn‚Äôt just conversation. Invite her back to your apartment to hangout &amp; then try to have sex with her.

Remember, you don‚Äôt have to be good at this, you‚Äôre allowed to be nervous and make mistakes‚Ä¶ but you do have to push yourself out of your comfort zone and actually make a move on girls.

You should always be pushing for sex as early and often as you can, starting from the first date. You might need to try multiple times on a date if she‚Äôs taking a little while to warm up to you, or if you‚Äôre nervous and keep pussying out. It might take you a couple of dates before she‚Äôs comfortable banging you. It‚Äôs all good.

But for god sakes, don‚Äôt get caught up in really long conversations spread out over multiple dates, thinking that‚Äôs an efficient way of getting you closer to sex. It isn‚Äôt ‚Äì trying to have sex is what gets you closer to having sex. Your goal is to move towards sex as soon as possible &amp; cut off any timewasters, because the only way you‚Äôre going to get laid/find a quality girlfriend/etc is by talking to a tonne of girls. You can‚Äôt do that if you‚Äôre getting bogged down in long, drawn-out, go-nowhere conversations &amp; wasting multiple dates not moving towards sex.

Your job is to talk waste as little time as possible on girls who just want to waste your time and never actually meet you. Every single second you spend talking to one of those girls is emotional and mental investment you‚Äôre expending. It takes energy, it kinda hurts a bit ‚Äì that‚Äôs going to drag down your ability to get on with your life and talk to other girls. It‚Äôll affect your general energy, you‚Äôll have less time and energy for your friends,less energy for the gym, less desire to go talk to more girls.

There‚Äôs also a very real chance you can become bitter if you let it drag on for long enough and with enough girls over a long enough time period. You‚Äôll eventually start believing things like ‚ÄúAll girls are just out to waste my time‚Äù. Or even more nefarious ‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm undateable and no girls want to have sex with me‚Äù.

No, you‚Äôre not undateable ‚Äì you‚Äôve just been wasting time on girls who never planned on meeting you. Or, you‚Äôve been cockblocking yourself by not making a move. If you get rid of timewaster girls as soon as possible, &amp; actually make moves on the girls you talk to, you‚Äôll free up time and emotional energy you can put towards the women who do want to actually meet up with you and have fun with you. You should be filtering out the timewasters, and focusing on finding the cool, awesome girls who are down to meet guys.

Girls Who Make it Easy to Have Sex with Them are Much More Fun Anyway

Another reason you should be seeking out girls who make it easy to have sex with you (rather than timewasters) is because you‚Äôll find you enjoy your time with the laid-back girls much more. If you‚Äôre a newbie this will sound counter-intuitive: but you‚Äôll actually respect girls who put out quicker ‚Äì because they‚Äôre being real with you and not playing games with you. You‚Äôll respect that they didn‚Äôt fuck you around and make you wait an arbitrary amount of time.

I‚Äôve said as much to girls I‚Äôve had sex with on the first date ‚Äì ‚ÄúI respect you for not playing games, and for being real. You didn‚Äôt try to use sex as a bargaining chip, you didn‚Äôt use it to ‚Äòextract‚Äô a relationship from me or get something from me. You just wanted to have sex with me because you‚Äôre attracted to me, I‚Äôm attracted to you, and sex is fun. That‚Äôs cool.‚Äù

These girls are so much more fun to hangout with ‚Äì they‚Äôre more laid back and will almost never manipulate you or use you. Here‚Äôs some [text screenshots](https://killyourinnerloser.com/timewasters/#10--examples-of-non-timewasters-) from girls I‚Äôve banged, to show you how easy they made it for me to have sex with them.

Girls who Make You Wait will Likely Continue to Be a Pain

Focusing more on girls who waste your time and make you wait: If a girl is wasting your time and making you talk to her for weeks on end before she even thinks of meeting with you ‚Äì that‚Äôs not going to suddenly just change if she ever does meet up with you. She‚Äôs a timewaster now, so she‚Äôll be a timewaster in the future.

If it takes you 4 weeks of talking before you even meet up for a date, then chances are she‚Äôll make you talk to her for 5 hours on the date before she even lets you kiss her. She sure as hell won‚Äôt come back to your apartment on the first or second date. She‚Äôll likely make you wait some arbitrary amount of time before you even think about having sex with her ‚Äì it‚Äôll be like drawing blood from a stone. No thanks.

Not to mention, if you do have sex with her, the magic will have been taken out of it. You‚Äôll feel like she‚Äôs just ‚Äúgiving you what you‚Äôre owed‚Äù ‚Äì you‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôve spent weeks/months talking to her, so of course she owes you sex by now, as a bare minimum. That doesn‚Äôt exactly sound like a healthy sexual relationship, does it?

Compare that to a girl you meet who‚Äôs super into you and has sex with you on the 1st or 2nd date. It‚Äôll be spontaneous, passionate, full of lust and desire. She‚Äôll want you, and you‚Äôll fucking want her. That‚Äôs the best type of sex ‚Äì the sex that didn‚Äôt take 4 weeks of grinding conversations and weeks of boring, platonic dates.

The girl who waits 4 weeks/several months to have sex with you is not going to be a passionate, crazy girl in bed. She‚Äôs not a sexual person; otherwise she would have been more keen to have sex with you. Sex obviously isn‚Äôt that important to her, and those girls end up being the worst type of girls to have in your bed. They‚Äôre not usually open to new experiences, the sex isn‚Äôt exciting and spontaneous, she‚Äôll usually have a list of ‚Äúrules‚Äù you have to follow in order for her to graciously give you the gift of her glorious gash. (Look at that absolutely astounding and amazing alliteration). All of that sounds like a boring business deal, rather than fun, wild sex.

Sex is supposed to be spontaneous, fun, exciting; it‚Äôs two people who are attracted to each other and can‚Äôt keep their dirty hands off each other.

The Takeaway

I know better than anyone the pain and frustration that comes from thinking you‚Äôre making progress with a girl over a few weeks, then having her lose interest and stop responding. I fucked around for over a decade before I finally got my shit together on this issue. I wasted tens of thousands of hours, I poured my heart and soul into being ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù and ‚Äúfunny‚Äù and ‚Äúa good conversationalist‚Äù ‚Äì all for very little reward. I was so frustrated I often broke down in tears; ‚ÄúOh look, here‚Äôs yet another girl wasting my time‚Äù.

You have a very good head start over me; you‚Äôre reading this article right now. Don‚Äôt be a total knobhead like I was; don‚Äôt repeat my mistakes by wasting time with month-long conversations. Push for a meetup and then push for sex as early as you possibly can with every new girl you date.

"[FR] Needed a mask to get into a store, unexpected conversation leads to hookup.","TL;DR: Random girl helps me gets cigs, we end up fucking a day later. 


For context: 22 year old uni student here, from West  Africa, came to Canada for studies. 

Anyway, we‚Äôre in lockdown here, haven‚Äôt met new girls in a while, had a breakup a few weeks ago.

Last weekend, I‚Äôm heading to the corner store to pick up some cigs. Realize I don‚Äôt have my mask in my pocket, and it‚Äôs a long walk back home.

Notice a girl standing outside the store, she‚Äôs cute. Brunette, short, light 7.

I‚Äôm not one for cold approaching, but shit, online dating wasn‚Äôt working out and I had nothing to lose, plus I needed a smoke. 

I walk up to her, make light conversation, ask her if she could help me out in getting a pack. Turns out she smokes too, like most girls in my city. 

She agrees, on the condition I share a smoke with her. I pass her a bill, she goes in and gets the pack for me. 

We sit on a bench somewhere, she‚Äôs laughing and throwing light shit tests, and at some point saying she hasn‚Äôt gotten laid in a minute due to lockdown. 

I try not to linger there too long, I had work in a few, so I ask for her number, she asks for mine, I thank her for the cigs and go home. 

She sends me a text a day later: ""Don‚Äôt forget your mask next time ;)"".

I‚Äôm eager in my mind, but do my best not to show it. I just say ""lol right"".

Two hours later she asks me if I still have cigs from the pack I bought, that she needs a smoke. I tell her I do, she‚Äôll have to bring a lighter.

She comes over, we share a smoke and a few beers, get in my room. We end up making out, I didn‚Äôt have any condoms, but she had one. What happens happens and she‚Äôs on her way home.",1,1

The power of saying things that shouldn't be said (an alternative to negging),"Another pandemic field report from the gym, since that's the only place I see other people these days. One thing I always hated about pua was the ""neg"". I used to be a very beta nice guy, and whenever I tried negging it just didn't feel right, and it never worked.

One reason it didn't work for me is I was beta. From an alpha, a girl wouldn't care. He's the leader. From a beta they're playing mental games with, it's game over. They don't want that negativity from someone that has zero chance with them. There's a fine line between a neg and ""this guy said mean things cause he's a beta and got mad"".

The idea behind a neg is to lower their image in relation to you. Instead you can say things that elevate your status above them without saying mean things by what I'm calling ""saying thing that shouldn't be said"". In a way this is ""cocky-funny"" with actual real life examples. It shows you are funny and do not give a fuck about what they or people in general think.

**Example 1:** one girl closing the gym (8.5) always flickers the lights when the gym is closing soon. A guy in the locker room was complaining about it. When I left I told her ""there was a guy in the locker room complaining about the lights"". She said ""oh yeah I do that when we're closing."" She gave me a look like I might actually be the one that was upset, and just pretending it was someone else. There was a pause and I said ""so do it again. Just to make him mad."" She laughed and I left.

**Example 2:** a girl (4) at the gym I work out at was closing the gym. A gym bud and I are always some of the last ones out and this girl often comes in to sweep the men's locker room while we're still in there. She yelled in ""is it just you two, do you have clothes on?"" My bud said ""Nope, you can come in."" I said ""do we have clothes on? what's the answer you're looking for? What are you hoping we had said?"" with a sly tone. My bud looked at me like ""you should not say something like that to a girl you don't know."" Obviously not interested in the girl but it's practice.

**Example 3:** different girl (9.5) was closing up was going around 5 mins before closing, telling people there were 5 mins left. She said that to me and I said ""nahh I'm going to need 10 minutes"". Kind of like a form of disagree and amplify here.

**Example 4:** 9.5 girl on another night, was going around picking up towels that people left around the gym. I was the only one in an area, and there was a towel probably 15 feet away on a different machine. It obviously was not my towel. We made eye contact and she said ""is this yours, can I take it?"" Clearly wasn't mine, so she started reaching for it, and then I said ""don't touch that!"" Paused and then said ""nahh it's not mine"". She laughed. Ended up getting her number a few mins after this.

What I'm calling ""saying things you shouldn't say"" is essentially flirting and cocky funny. But I like my phrase because it gives you an idea of what ""flirting"" and ""cocky funny"" can actually entail. When I was younger I would think ""how do you flirt?"" and when reading pua articles I'd think ""wtf do they mean by cocky funny?""",1,1

"""Follow their lead"" shit tests","I rarely come to this sub anymore, so this is probably covered somewhere, but wanted to discuss a frame shit test that isn't something I had personally read in the past.

Shit test examples on pua sites were always essentially insults, and the recommended answer was usually ""agree &amp; amplify"" even if the amplification was dumb and lame.

So wanted to give you two examples of the ""follow their lead"" shit tests I've come across a few times.  First noticed it in person probably 3-4 years back.  Was talking/semi dancing with this 7 at a bar.  After a 5-10 minutes, she grabbed my hand and twirled me to the beat of the music.  I playfully went along, matching her enthusiasm even though it really didn't fit the scene of the bar.  She literally walked away within 15 seconds and avoided me the rest of the night.

Recently, I met a 9.5 who would do similar over text.  I said we should get drinks the following Monday, and she seemed interested, but said she didn't know if she could cause of work (which was bs).  Sunday I texted her again and she said ""Sorry I have work :("".

Beta me of the past would have already been head over heels and followed her frame here, saying ""Damn that sucks :( when would be a good day for you?""

My brothers.  I was scoping this girl for quite some time.  I‚Äôd say HB8.5 and she is somewhat tall I‚Äôd say a mere 5‚Äô8 on a good day.  (Hence a good day is a day that she is wearing heels if you catch my drift;).  And no I‚Äôm not talking mid drift HAAA.

~Back to the point~ Anyways so she‚Äôs somewhat tall - and I myself am a shorter feller.  I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô8 soaking wet on a god damn rainy day.

So yeah I‚Äôve been scoping this HB8.5 and I can just tell by the way that she moves that she has a preference for men in the higher domain when it comes to
The secular factor of height in that context.  

Everytime single time i would see her at the bar I would Try to approach (2 times total).  I would wear my versace chain reaction sneakers ($850) because they add a few inches in height.  This coupled with my inserts that I wear add me to a total height of 5‚Äô11.5 give or take the common denominator. This would make me feel high and mighty that I was of her stature and rank in this height.


The problem erupted after my second time approaching,  I realized that she could sniff out my shit from a mile away.  Kind of as if this woman had a sixth sense??? am I nuts? Anyways yeah I felt like the kid that was 3 kids in a trench coat on bojack horseman HAAAA. Not even gonna lie.  

Consequently - My voice cracked and she ended up nexting me for the next alpha guy in line at the bar.  Big dicken Larry. I was crushed.


It kept on my mind all quarantine (this was before quarantine when all of this happened) I spent more time reading the sidebar and checking gaylubeoil (my brotha) I also found how to just accept myself for who I am.  

Yeah I‚Äôm a shorter fella ~ but so what.  I‚Äôve accepted it and Im comfortable and confident in my own skin.  Enough to Curb stomp a Versace sneaker to the dome. Lmao. 

So fast forward to last night ~ after doing some long hard thinking about the situation and coming to terms that I‚Äôm a shorter fella.  I decided it would be smart to just come to her correct as my authentic self.  

So I pulled up to the spot - there‚Äôs only one bar in my town, and she‚Äôs there ~ literally every Thursday so I knew it would be my time to go for the kill.

I saw her by the bar &amp; came up to her.  Looked her in the eye and just said straight up ‚Äú I know you were feeling me before but that I wasn‚Äôt vibing right.

Problem with Onenitis. GFTOW won't help,[removed],2,1
Please tell me I did the right thing,"I was on and off again with a plate that was actually very interested in me. It's a very long story, but I have certain personal issues that would make me unfit husband, so I never committed to her. This relationship with her lasted for a good ten years be she and I both dated constantly, always getting in touch with each other from time to time and clearly caring very much for each other.

By chance, she once slipped up and told me she cheated on one of her boyfriends with a one-night stand, hamstering it to me as being because he was emotionally abusive in the face of her kindness and low maintenance (which is true).

That said, she dated and slept with a few men in her life -- probably 5 that I know of. I never committed to her and she got married, and I am severely depressed about it, having lost the chance with a woman that I honestly consider to have been the only one I could ever have thought of settling down with, but after a year of sadness and misery at having lost her, I try to tell myself that I do not want a woman who has been pumped out by five other men (at least). I know society says that this is an outdated mode of thinking, but I can't shake it, and I was hoping there would be someone here who would tell me I'm not nuts for thinking that way. 

It's the only saving grace I can possibly think of.

"Beyond willpower: a simple philosophy to stop struggling with your own mind, to stop living blurry days in a blurry life."," **Summary**

How much we struggle and writhe with our own mind, how many times we are annoyed by our own lack of doing! How many times have we proven ourselves to be unpredictable, untrustworthy - not to the world but to ourselves! And worse, we turn to ourselves, to our brothers, we shout: ‚Äò*Have you no shame in that? Have you no willpower?*‚Äô But what if willpower isn‚Äôt enough? How many times did I will, but did I not have enough power to will - at least not long enough! I tell you only few men in the history of our species have had the privilege to become who they are. To begin your hero‚Äôs journey, to one day do what others have not, what others *cannot*, we tell ourselves *to fight against ourselves*, we believe we must suffer. But I tell you, only a weak mind *can* learn to fight himself more viciously, and be *surprised* he ends up paralyzed. Oh! To be a good master! Oh! To be a good slave!

**Body**

1.

In the year 217 BC, Hannibal, the general of Cartago - already in his time considered a military genius, was obliterating Roman armies, marching on to burn Rome to the ground. Those who couldn‚Äôt afford to flee, piled up within the city gates. Rome was swept by panic. The Roman Senate, realizing the imminent destruction of the city from within and without, appointed Quintus Fabius Maximus as dictator, rei gerundae causa, ""for the matter to be done"". Fabius claimed the Gods had been neglected too long and had to be appeased. He commanded the burning of harvest, the slaughter of livestock and for the people to carry out precise rituals. Whether or not Fabius was a religious man, he *was* a military genius too! He had deduced - and never assumed!- that what would bring his own people and army to *blindly move at his command*, and to do it *willingly.* 

2.

To get out of his bed, to treat his skin, to work out, to do the dishes, to leave his phone untouched‚Ä¶ How many times does the weak mind hear his own command, but does he willfully ignore it, revolt against it, even dare to reason against it? Is it every hour, or every minute of every day? There is no sign stronger that our Western culture is infected with weak minds than the *encouragement* that he receives who justifies his doing only by his feeling - how inconsistent and unstable his feeling may be! How it arouses him, that he has thrown off his own chains. But how long before he becomes restless, resentful, before he cries out that he *doesn‚Äôt know where to go*! How *hungry* he will become for his own guidance!

3.

Worse than revolting, the weak mind has learned to trick himself! He begins to paint but only paints one layer! His only measure is to make the guilt, the uneasiness he feels *bearable.* 

4.

Oh! To conquer and possess yourself ‚Äì to execute what you know to be good for you *without question, without complaint* ‚Äì is there a greater purpose to your life, to your day? 

5.

But you cannot master yourself, if you cannot *become* a good slave too! To fulfill the task at hand to the best of your ability, to *blindly* obey any command you gave yourself! To be a good master, oh but to be a good slave!

6.

Most of all my heart mourns when I am in a room with those who listen to their own laughter, and who have taken an oath to let their laughter travel as far as it can be inhaled. I feel their eyes full of lust looking out of the basement window along the feet of the city. I suffer to see their shoulders groan under the throne of their *tyrannical mind*. To look like a fool and *laugh*, to command yourself to do and *to rest*‚Ä¶ To be a good slave, oh but to be a good master!

7.

When something has finally revealed itself to him who has begun his hero‚Äôs journey, when an idea becomes *transparent*, when he runs along its borders, how exhilarated he becomes! But he is annoyed when he meets with any resistance to get to the other side! What is he then, but a fly bumping into glass? How is it possible, he didn‚Äôt consider *the resistance to get there*? Where he has seen a task and judges the *act* of solving that task to be simple, he cannot spark more easily the fire of a revolt within himself than to also consider its *execution* to be simple!

9.

To ask yourself permission to clean your toilet, to ask yourself permission to approach a girl in the street, it is a privilege to be experienced by him who is completely in possession of himself.

10.

To lift, to run, to go in the woods, to follow the stream, to catch the sun on a winter morning, it is to find the window wide open. To know and to command myself to turn to that clarity, that serenity in which I can breathe endlessly, where to venture is a necessity to my survival, to bring myself there, that is my ritual. That is where I bring myself, *and where I come* to follow me, my will*,* willingly, wholeheartedly, *where it is beyond my power.*",29,1
"Change the approach: Stop asking so many questions. This isn't a job interview, so stop treating it like one.","A friend recently gave me his phone and showed me his online dating profile (tinder and hinge). He is constantly wondering why he isn't getting any matches and no girls are responding to him. This guy is 6' 5"", kind of skinny and wears glasses. Not a bad looking dude at all and has the advantage of being tall on his side. 

There was a lot wrong with his profile (his pictures being one thing), but when I took a look at the messages he was sending it became abundantly clear that he was falling into the same cycle that most men do when they try to approach women (in person or online) - **Every opening line was a question. This isn't a job interview, stop treating it like one.**

How many questions do you think they get on a regular basis from strangers? Hey how are you? Hey what's up? Hey how was your day?? Even things a little less basic like, Hey! Did you see that new movie that just came out??

Unless you are a model or a celebrity, in which case you probably don't need to do much approaching at all, then women will just ignore you because hey, they've got 10 other suitors that will just be a little bit more interesting than you just were.

It's one of the simplest and most effective changes you can make when trying to talk to women. First of all, this is going to take a little bit more effort on your part. Sack up and do it. You get what you put in in all aspects of life and getting a women's attention is no different. 

Take a look at what she's wearing, what she's doing, where she is, who she is with, what she is eating or drinking etc. Use this as the basis of your line. Once you've identified something, use it as your approach.

Here's an example for someone you just matched with online. It may sound silly, but the idea applies to any of the examples I listed above. 

**You see that a girl you've matched with is eating french fries in one of her pictures.** 

Think of anything and everything that may have to do with the idea of french fries - Where she got them from, what they taste like, what kind of condiments she uses on them etc. *Comment on it instead of asking a question.*

**The Opener**

The line is ***NOT****: ""Hey! Those fries look amazing, where did you get them??""*

The line is: *""Don't tell me you got those fries at ::Restaurant A::, ::Restaurant B:: is so much better...*

It's a subtle difference, but one that exudes a more flirtatious, playful, and most importantly, confident vibe. Furthermore, it separates you from the pack. 

**The Conversation**

Once you've been talking to her, continue to ask as few questions as possible. Ask yourself if in a normal conversation, would you consistently be asking questions after receiving responses? Again, this isn't a job interview. 

You get a response from French Fry girl: 

*""No way, It actually was at ::Restaurant A:: and I will defend their fries to the death...""*

Again, your response should be one of confidence and playful competition (you are talking about french fries after all)

*""Man..im so disappointed in you, I just ate at ::Restaurant A:: last week and they came out cold and soggy, not a good look at all....""*

\*NOTE: Once you've gotten a few back and fourths going and you are confident you have her attention, a playful question can be mixed in, but use it sparingly and save them for the first date.

**The Date Setup**

You've been talking to her for a while and its obvious that shes into you because she hasnt ghosted you yet. If you've managed to make it this far after leading with fucking french fries then she's not going to reject you when you make a move. 

This is the simplest step. Keep your confidence, continue to be playful and **set the date up**, dont ask. 

The line is ***NOT:*** **""**Do you want to get a drink to figure this out?""

The line is: ""Well I think we should probably get a drink (or fries!!) sometime and figure this whole thing out.""

The example of talking about french fries may sound silly, but if you apply the overall approach (subtle observations of her/her surroundings and actions), the result is often the same. I can guarantee she's gotten 20 messages asking about her day, 10 about how hot/beautiful she is, and 5 pickup lines she may/may not be interested in, but you're probably the only one thats asked about those delicious french fries she ate that one time.

Be unique, seperate yourself from the pack and stop asking so many questions while you're doing it.",71,1

So what is success to you? Money? A family? Be famous? Be spiritually sound? Leave the world better than you left it? A girl slurping on your cock?

Your answer may change over time but keep asking yourself that.

Whatever your answer is, dont jeapordise that. Prioritise you first and dont spent any time that antogonises that. Keep tabs on your goal.

What you dont realise is who you are not is just as important as who you are. 

The first step to who we really are and can become is usually finding out what you are not. Taking shit from your boss? a girl that won't put out?  bullied by some dude half your size? a shady friend that uses you? 

Stand up and cut out what you dont want in your life.

By process of elimation this leads us to who we are. 

Too much time on your phone? on the drink? fast food? spending time with idiots that'll wash their hands of you in a heartbeat?

Stop giving them your time and when you do, you find yourself finding more time doing what you want because you just eliminated the whos, whats, whens and hows that stop you becoming who you really are.

Get rid of the wasted time and youll find who you really are through the process of elimination. 


Eliminate who you are not, first.

My very first red pill with my very first girlfriend,"**The cold void of an endless January seems even crueler when juxtaposed with the colored lights of December.** It was a December morning, before first period, that our eyes met in front of her locker. In what couldn‚Äôt have been planned, at least consciously planned- perhaps, more like the march of the penguins, or a rosebud uncoiling before the relentless morning sun- perhaps, something guided by nature and etched into a plan that wasn‚Äôt within our power to modify. Our eyes met, guided by invisible forces so strong that they had almost revealed themselves- a proof for God, had we been more conscious of it in the moment- our eyes met, and hung in the air frozen. No words exchanged. Even a kiss would have spoiled the purity of the moment. We had all that was necessary, and we could make from it something more.

We stayed after school that day and spent the afternoon talking about what we wanted the future to look like. Too shy, of course, to include one another in these plans- but we spoke in ways where this acknowledgement wasn‚Äôt necessary; that it was maybe so pressing and obvious that it could be left unsaid.

That night, December 16th, 1996, I took the late bus home from school- and that night was the only time I wore a seatbelt. This was the greatest day of my life, and I couldn‚Äôt let anything ruin it.

**It was in the cold void of January that Kevin had slipped you the little blue sheet of paper,** folded up with your name across the front, during second period Theology. You had nothing to worry about, he said. He wasn‚Äôt interested, he explained. He was already dating Michelle- a fact you all knew, but Jessica had still called him the night before, just to be sure.

"Recognize when women are bored, which is most of the time","TLDR: A woman is only on her phone trading messages with men when there is nothing better or more interesting going on. That means if her phone is in her hand, she is either bored, horny, or lonely. If you recognize this and immediately propose something interesting that will make her less bored, that will get you a lot farther a lot more often than trying to have some kind of boring regular conversation. A woman who is bored and turning to her phone for stimulation is not looking for a regular conversation.



The not TLDR part: The internet, dating apps, and text messaging has become the primary way that most men communicate with prospective women to fuck. These are also the preferred methods for most women to meet men. They enable women to compartmentalize. When a woman is looking for a casual encounter, a date, or her next boyfriend, she pulls out her phone and switches into a dating mindset. She meets men through these phone methods reliably enough that she doesn‚Äôt need to explore other methods for meeting men. As a result, most other times she is out and about, a man approaching her would catch her off-guard, raise her suspicions, and seem a little strange, because she is not in a dating mindset at that time. It‚Äôs still possible to meet a woman in public and set up a date. It‚Äôs even refreshing for many women. Just be aware that a woman you meet in public is not in a dating mindset the same way she is when she pulls her phone out to swipe on guys, send messages on dating apps, or text with guys she knows. So the ‚Äúday game‚Äù approach is a little different than the Tinder approach or the last call at the bar approach.

Men tend to overthink the messages they send, because men have a hard time putting themselves in the woman‚Äôs shoes. They don‚Äôt realize that when a woman is holding her phone and trading messages with men, she is already in a dating mindset. There is no need to feel her out, warm her up, ask her how her day is going, get to know her better, or try to dig around for some clear signal that it‚Äôs okay to try to meet up with her. If she is trading messages with men on her phone, she is already there, and playing around with banal conversation is just boring her. If she‚Äôs trading messages with you, she‚Äôs looking for an activity, not a pleasant conversation.

If something incredibly interesting were going on with a woman right now, she wouldn‚Äôt be on her phone trading messages with you. She‚Äôd be enjoying that incredibly interesting thing that‚Äôs going on. Women only pick up their phone to trade messages with men when they are: 1) bored; 2) horny; or 3) lonely.

So if a woman is trading messages with you, that means she is bored, horny, or lonely. Which means that she is not looking for boring conversations about work or school or how her day is going. She is looking for something interesting and exciting to make her less bored, or someone forward and sexual to make her less horny, or someone who proposes to meet up and do something to make her less lonely.

If a woman is trading messages with you, you are already in. That is the signal. She is signaling that she is bored, horny, or lonely. Because if she were none of those, she wouldn‚Äôt be burying her nose in her cell phone looking for stimulation.

Abandon plain conversation. Abandon asking about her day, her life, her family, her job, her school. Abandon getting to know her better. Say something interesting. Say something exciting. Say something direct. Propose an activity. Propose a meeting. Propose fun. Recognize that she is bored and do something to make her less bored. Don‚Äôt dither around trading a dozen messages first, or some other guy she‚Äôs messaging at the same time as you will beat you to it. Be interesting immediately.",32,1

Beginning with the End: How to Find and Establish Your Personal Values,"After reading the following post, block out 5-10 minutes to do the mentioned mental visualization. Don't worry about family, friends, or your job. Doing this visualization will help you greatly in gaining some inner insight as to what it is exactly you currently value in life and whether or not you're on track with living up to those values. 

Imagine yourself driving to the funeral reception of a loved one. After pulling up outside the building, parking the car, entering the hall, greeting the other guests and family members present, and taking in the soft organ music and smells of burning incense, you stand in the middle of the aisle and observe, up ahead, a coffin surrounded by flowers. As you walk closer, your head partially bowed down, you get the instinct to look up into the inside of the open casket. To your disbelief, the person inside the casket is you. You recoil away and take a seat in the front row of the hall and grab a program sheet. Your name and picture are there, on the front cover, and there are to be four guest speakers. The first speaker is someone from your immediate or extended family; perhaps a brother or sister, a daughter or son, cousin, aunt, or nephew. The second speaker is your best or close friend. The third is a current or former coworker or business associate, either a former manager or someone you worked closely on a project with. Lastly, the fourth speaker is someone from a school, community, or other extracurricular organization you may have been involved with.

Think deeply and honestly with yourself. What would you like each of these four people to say about you and what they thought of you? How do you want each of these people to remember you? Were you ""greatly missed and yearned to be around "", ""not around enough"", and serve as an example for why one should appreciate the good people in one's lives while they were still around? Or were you remembered by a coworker or friend for your creativity, work ethic, or compassion during a particularly hard moment in their lives? Before you read further, take a few minutes to write down what each of those four groups would say about you.

By doing this visualization, you should have subconsciously touched upon some of your deep-rooted, fundamental values. Although it is a bit morbid and uncomfortable to visualize yourself at your own funeral, it's a good way to *begin with the end in mind, to understand what we want our end destination to be.* The truth is, we are all caught up in the whirlwind of life and it becomes ever the easier to get caught up in new, distracting activities. It is also very easy, unfortunately, to spend many years of our lives in jobs we don't like or fulfill us, spend a lot of money on things that aren't necessary for or contribute to our happiness, spend a lot of time around negative people or maybe don't appreciate our efforts, or not pay enough mind in helping those around us. 

Whatever you visualized said about you also should clarify what you deem to be your own definition of success. Is a close friend or coworker going to victoriously gloat at you from the podium for perhaps making more money than you in their career, having a bigger house, or driving a faster car? One would really hope they wouldn't! They will remember you by your nature, what you contributed to their lives, and the positive impact you have had on them. 

Condense the essence of what each of the four speakers said into a single word, to ultimately have four words total. Perhaps for you, it may be something like Love, Compassion, Creativity, Humility. These four words are what you really want to be remembered by, what you want deep down or know you should be doing more of. Use them to help guide your everyday decisions and planning. Is the current or planned task or activity you're doing aligning with one of these four words or values? Does your personal planner take into account time to do a task or activity to work toward one of these values? Make sure they do! Anything to the contrary is perhaps something that you're doing habitually or without much thought. 

By living your life with the end in mind, and according to your own vision of your end, by your own values and virtues, you cease to follow the values or programming instilled into you unknowingly by your family, community, or popular culture. Follow your own voice, follow your own values, to how you ultimately want to be remembered.",15,1
How To Consistently Be In A Great Mood When You Go Out,"How To Consistently Be In A Great Mood When You Go Out

Intro:

Does it ever feel like you can only have great conversations with people when you‚Äôre in a good mood?

For some reason if you wake up feeling great, the rest of the day magically opens up. Jokes come naturally... Abundance mentality flows freely...

It doesn‚Äôt feel like you even have to try that hard to be a charming, witty bastard.

But what happens if you didn‚Äôt get a good night‚Äôs sleep and wake up feeling horrible?

Well, here comes the pain...

Every conversation feels like a chore. And people don‚Äôt react to you the way they would when you‚Äôre in a good mood. Girls start putting up resistance right away. And you can barely even pass shit tests anymore, your brain feels 2X slower...

You just want to be left alone. You want to take naps to try to ‚Äúrescue‚Äù the day.

You practically have to slap yourself across the face to even work up enough motivation to drag your grumpy ass to the gym...

(For some reason though, your lifts don‚Äôt suffer at all from being tired or in a bad mood. Anyone who‚Äôs been lifting for a while knows this weird phenomenon)

Body:

For the longest time, I tried to force myself to go out and approach every Friday and Saturday even if I was in a bad mood.

And surprise, surprise, it almost never turned out well. These were the days I‚Äôd go out and get rejected 10X in a row. 

These were the days my brain felt slow as fuck, like there was a dense fog inside making me take twice as long to come up with things to say...

I had two possible choices. Either ‚Äúlisten to my body‚Äù and stop going out on days I felt like shit, or find some way to FORCE myself to feel good when I go out.

I‚Äôm a stupidly stubborn person so I chose to find a way to force myself to be happy. Lol.

The first thing I tried was just going out for runs in the local park because I heard the cardio releases feel good endorphins. I also figured being surrounded by Nature couldn‚Äôt hurt.

Maybe this works for some people but I couldn‚Äôt stand just walking or running around with no purpose other than to feel good.

I mean, it was worth a shot but obviously I wasn‚Äôt going to walk my way to happiness...

But I wasn‚Äôt about to give up... And the second thing I tried was meditation. It‚Äôs recommended so much on here, I had to give it a shot right?

So I tried clearing my mind of all thoughts, both positive and negative. Being present to the moment. Bringing all my focus to my own breath entering and leaving my nostrils...

Some days, I meditated for a full hour before going out to approach or picking up the phone and making an important sales call.

And this actually worked! Without fail, every time I meditated for an hour before making an important call or going out to approach girls, I‚Äôd always be on point in my conversations. Always be in a good mood.

The problem is, this strategy just took too damn long to execute... I tried meditating for shorter time periods (15 min or less) but found I didn‚Äôt get the same happiness boost as longer periods of meditation.

And as everyone knows, certain important calls... you just don‚Äôt have any time to prepare for. You have to be in a great mood. You have to be on point with less than 5 minutes to prepare.

So for the longest time, I was just stuck with the mindset that if I didn‚Äôt meditate for at least half an hour before an important meeting or date, it was doomed from the start...

And it continued that way until I took a trip to Miami with a friend.

All of a sudden, I felt great every single day. I couldn‚Äôt even explain why.

I mean, I‚Äôve been on vacations before but never consistently felt great like this, so it can‚Äôt just be the change in scenery.

I put some pieces together from some reading I‚Äôve done in the past to make the conclusion that our mood has a lot to do with the sunlight.

It‚Äôs why people find it almost impossible to be in a bad mood on a beach in the Bahamas.

It‚Äôs also why countries like Norway or Sweden have such high rates of depression - and even worse suicide - despite having extremely high living standards. People just don‚Äôt get enough sunlight there.

So naturally, my first instinct was to try taking Vitamin D supplements. After all, Sunlight = stimulates Vitamin D production right? Herpy derp derp derp!

Useless. Didn‚Äôt notice a single noticeable change in mood from daily Vitamin D supplementation of 2000 IU a day. Tried raising the dose to 4000 IU a day, still nothing. Maybe 6000 IU? Still no effect...

Instead, I found a rather unconventional solution. Using your imagination to visualize the Warm Sunlight around you.

You should give this a shot right now.

Imagine that there‚Äôs a ball of warm, orange light all around your head. The light feels so warm on your face, and you can barely keep your eyes open because the sunlight is so bright!

And... if you did this correctly, you should instantly feel great.

Congratulations, you are no longer a slave to your emotions. You can choose to be in a good mood whenever you want,

Lessons Learned:

The true beauty of this Orange Ball of Light technique is that it barely takes 10 seconds to implement.

But every time I do it before I approach, I‚Äôm instantly happy, chill, relaxed, as if I was sunbathing on a beach in Miami without a care in the world.

I‚Äôve tried looking up scientific literature about why this works but couldn‚Äôt really find anything definitive.

Maybe it works by tapping into the collective conscience of Western Civilization in associating Sunny Beaches  with good vibes &amp; relaxation,

Maybe since Einstein proved that at the fundamental level, we‚Äôre all just highly condensed energy, doing this orange ball of light technique raises your energy levels.

The important thing is it doesn‚Äôt really matter why it works.

All you need to know is that it is indeed possible to be in a great mood whenever you want.

Hope you have a great day!",119,1

"For people who STILL have oneitis, you gotta read this.","So I always had a crush on this girl whom I knew since we were little kids. I was always a beta bitch who didn't know shit about girls and always thought that I will ALWAYS get the ONE someday. Hell when I was 12 I even fantasized of marrying that girl and living a happy Disney type love life with her.(I know it's cringe but plz read on. You'll get your lesson) . Back then I was a class clown who loved Making people laugh at the cost of my respect. And that obviously led to me being bullied every single day. 






I used to get badly beat up by basically every other guy in school when I was 11 and this continued till age 12. I used to get beat up but I used to think that this will make HER feel pity for me and eventually she will love the sensitive guy that I am and will become my wife. The whole class used to call me Joker. I never felt bad as I knew SHE was there for me. One fine day even she called me a Joker and said that it's her birthday party and she wants her friends to have some fun and hence I needed to come ready with all jokes . Bear in mind this was when we were 12 ,even at that time AWALT is /was true. I was ready to go when suddenly we can shifted to another place due to financial issues.





I couldnt contact her ever again. Now I'm 16 nearly 17 and I found her IG. I waited for few days and I saw her pics on her friend's IG who had an open account. She was good looking but nothing out of the world. Even until now I actually didn't have any SEXUAL attraction to her,only her name and pic gives me butterflies in my stomach and I start day dreaming how we both will live a happy married life aka Disney love life. Even now I used to feel that, until 3 hours ago when I texted her. 





I asked how she was and whether she remembers me? Her answer came after 2 hours,well it wasn't an answer she just saw the text and didn't reply. One hour later she replies,Joker I needed you at my party. You weren't there and hence we got bored. She sent this emoji afterwards 'üòèüòÇ'. That broke my heart and I felt so bad,a pain in my chest. All my dreams were shattered and the girl who I thought was different from others,the girl who was like a disney princess to me ......she too was just like others if not worse.






For those who read the full part thank you! I hope you learnt from my mistake. The red pill might be difficult to swallow and unless you experience the things they say you'll never believe it just like me but my dear brothers you have to learn from my mistake. Don't EVER think a particu girl is different from others bcoz she isn't and she never will be . AWALT AWALT AWALT!

The Scarcity of Blowjobs and It's Effect on The Economy,"**Getting pussy is easier if you are not a pussy.**

Women are pretty simple in the big scheme of things. They want men who are handsome, athletic and good at what they do. But most of all what they want is a man, not some sniveling little boy who jerks off in socks and plays video games all day and borrows money from his parents to pay his bills. Granted many of these men fall into some pussy once every leap year, but I would argue, quite accurately, that men who spend their days wasted in the depths of distraction, and the mediocrity that ensues get much less pussy than purpose driven men who know what they are doing with their lives and are attacking their goals with a vengeance. Listed next are some of the  foundations everyone talks about to be successful with women. Aesthetics, career, social proof and wealth. But after the foundation is laid the biggest variable is your personality and how you interact with people. I am going to tell you a true story about a guy named Tom and how his lack of drive impacted the economy and his ability to get quality blowjobs. 

**Being purpose driven and why exuding greatness elicits emotional responses in women.**

I mentioned women liking men who were after a purpose or goal, who are passionately seeking something or building something. The reason women are so drawn to this is it evokes emotion, that passion for your goals isn‚Äôt a common trait in the mass of the populace, most people are happy with their grind and pussy once a week and a blowjob every couple years. Let's introduce Tom, he doesn‚Äôt get blowjobs or pussy often at all, he works 6 days a week 10 hours a day and buys his wife whatever she wants, Tom is a real person. I used to work with a guy, Tom, who hated his wife so much that he begged me to set him up with women, his exact words ‚ÄúI never get blow jobs, she doesn‚Äôt like to do it we only have sex maybe once a month, just wait until you have been married for X years, you‚Äôll see.‚Äù My response was simple, no, I will never know what that is like, I would divorce her and move on. 

**Don't be like Tom.**

This same man told me a story of when he  went through a separation with his current wife before I knew him where he waited outside his wife's boyfriend's house with a gun in his hand fantasizing about smoking this dude. He never did it. He took her back and bought back into the marriage counseling and working a job he hated, to raise two kids he didn‚Äôt really like and got to fuck a wife he loathed, once a month, and never get blow jobs. My brain doesn‚Äôt work like that when I was in high school  I used to try to get as many girls to blow me as possible. In my twenties  I became quite successful at getting lots of women to blow me, entire circles of friends, and still into my thirties I have mastered the art of talking women into blowing me, even getting two women to blow me at the same time. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I like sex, but the sound of gagging does something to me, it‚Äôs similar to crossing a goal off a checklist and knowing that you are only becoming more and more successful by the day. Every little check, every little choke just makes me feel more and more powerful, like the world is at my fingertips.

**You decide the outcome of your interactions with women by your behaviors.**

So that's a big long round about way of getting to my point, which is your personality and how you interact with women is the determining factor into your success with women as a whole. I love to get blown and fuck random women, but I do not subscribe to a lot of the nonsense that is associated with the other sex, like you can‚Äôt be friends with them or have successful relationships, that all women are a certain way or that some weird conservative dogmatic ideology is the key. Honestly, it‚Äôs fucking nonsense, women are that way to you because you are a fucking loser, women blow me and give me what I want. This point is important because a woman's behavior towards you could ‚Äújust be the way she is‚Äù, or through personality, charisma and just generally being masculine you can get a better version of that  woman, better than the guy I worked with got (I understand that even the greatest of men can be taken for all they have and fucked over. We edge the odds in our favor by not being a fucking loser). Whether it be in a one night stand, a FWB or a long term relationship, I think we can all agree we want blowjobs and the more the better, and if we can‚Äôt‚Ä¶we might not have much in common. 

Here is how to do it once you have laid the foundation for your success in the world. If you‚Äôre asking what is the foundation, read the sidebar, **I think it has something to do with lift weights, get money, fuck bitches.** 

**Presentation is important. Display value, real value preferably.**

The way that you present yourself to the world, to women and to a woman specifically is a huge factor in success. Confidence should exude from you, your ego should be big, and you should be proud of who you are and what you do, and if you are, why wouldn‚Äôt you feel comfortable talking to  a woman about it. I don‚Äôt mean laying out your life path and seeing if she likes your ideas or telling her about the socks you saw at Costco when you were shopping with your mom, I mean a simple conversation where when she asks you about your hobbies and you hit her with the real shit, the I am in the process of taking over the whole fucking world shit. I am building  X business right now, I am looking to travel to X where I am planning on doing X. It is similar to this project that I did with X in X country. Now if you‚Äôre saying right now well I don‚Äôt do anything interesting, I don‚Äôt build anything or do anything cool. That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt get pussy, you don‚Äôt have the foundations covered, you are not interesting, or talking to you is like licking a wet napkin you picked up off the bathroom counter. If you‚Äôre not interested in your purpose why the fuck would anybody else be, and why would any woman want to get on her knees and pay homage to your pillar of accomplishments. You gotta be out their grinding, creating shit; not consuming others content with all your free time. Not sitting outside your wife‚Äôs boyfriend's house wishing he wasn‚Äôt throat fucking fucking your girl. 

**Get a purpose and invest in yourself or do not expect women to want to blow you.**

You gotta be interesting, and if you are not, figure that shit out. Invest in yourself and travel, build a career and accomplishments that make your ego so big you become a borderline sociopath with illusions of grandeur and world domination. At this point if your not getting pussy and you are not lifting weights like it's your day job, fuck off and don‚Äôt ask another question of anybody how to get pussy until you‚Äôre checking that box 3-6 times a week. Lifting weights and charisma go hand in hand with the former being the blowjob pass and the latter the key to the city.

 **A tangent about some nonsense I have been reading people write about that has nothing to do with getting pussy or blowjobs. If you're not getting blowjobs, on vacation or stimulating the economy then wtf are you really doing?**

Don‚Äôt get distracted by bullshit. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is really going on with half the shit people are purveying to become successful with women...semen retention, are you fucking kidding me? What the fuck is that going to do, what are you a semen bladder? If you think that getting pussy involves retaining massive amounts of semen then you‚Äôre the fucking blowjob giver. You think I wake up with a hard on every day and can bust 2-3 nuts a day and I am supposed to retain that? Fuck that, I‚Äôm spraying that shit everywhere, dudes wife's throat while he waits outside, the girl you are scared to talk to, your moms pillow, every single girl I can talk to at college, literally anywhere I can. You got to lay off the bullshit and leave the semen retention to the ladies that are willing, **it‚Äôs really fucking simple TLDR Lift weights like a psycho, build things, improve your career, dress like you don‚Äôt live in a box and put that shit on display for everyone around you and fucking be proud of who you are. Trust me, if you build yourself, they will cum.**",72,1

It finally makes sense. Shame it took me this long to figure it out.,"For the longest time, I spent the better part of the last 13 years pursuing women. I‚Äôm in my late twenties, and it just dawned on me.

A puppy loves his owner, a child. A child loves his mother. A mother loves her man. And man loves ________?

Religious individuals could put ‚ÄúGod‚Äù. Some name it ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù. But it‚Äôs all the same.

In my head, I realized it when it *clicked*. 

Women don‚Äôt want men‚Äôs love. They love what you can *give them*. The same way a puppy loves getting treats from a child.

Every time I got involved with someone, she always bitched and complained about the same thing. ‚ÄúHe cheated‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt love me.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe was selfish.‚Äù

And yet they spread their legs for him. Cried. Begged. And waited patiently for him to come back and love her. But he never did. And now I know why. I understand why he couldn‚Äôt. Because I‚Äôm like him now. I was just so tired and burnt out from getting hurt from women in the same. damn. way. almost predictably, that I can‚Äôt bother having feelings for anyone ever again.

But I can open myself up to God. My purpose. And invest all of my emotions into that.

I grew up Catholic. Then I was an atheist for a while. And then for a while longer I dove into the quantum physics of how reality works in conjunction to thoughts and physical manifestation, which pointed closer and closer to God. But now, I can truthfully say it‚Äôs become faith based. I know God is here. I know he/she listens.

And sure enough, *as soon as I started focusing on God and my purpose*, as soon as I made that mental decision, 5 minutes later I get a text from a girl who ghosted me back in November telling me she missed me and was thinking of me. The timing was fucking scary. But I knew at that moment how real it all was. The red pill truth, ‚Äúfollow your purpose‚Äù, and the way gravity works. Energy is mass in motion. My body became more energetic as I focused on my purpose, and therefore became more massive in a scientific sense: I mattered. (Matter and motion = energy). 

I can finally sleep well tonight. Thank you TRP for changing my life.",21,1

Why Players Get Laid,"Women can't help but fuck players. Why? 

Firstly, they are completely addicted to DRAMA and EMOTIONS. There is simply no better way to cause drama and emotions than for her to know you're fucking other girls. It's the pinnacle for her. 

Secondly, the pre-selection drives her hypergamy instinct into overdrive. There is no better indicator to her that she should fuck you than the fact that you're very openly fucking other women. 

This makes no sense to me as a man. My biological sexual strategy instincts are completely different to a woman's. My biological strategy says fuck women that nobody else is fucking. 

A woman's says fuck the dude ALL the other women are fucking. 

I've also felt guilty and selfish in the past for being a ""player""... I'd make some moves, get laid for a while, find a girl I liked and latch on. 

I'd find myself feeling like I got lucky to find a woman that I liked to be around, and she stuck with me, even though I behaved like a selfish dickhead fuckboy. 

And now at the age of 48 I've finally come to realize the disappointing fact that being a ""player"" is simply being exactly what women want in a man. 

How sick is that? 

The old tenants are correct. 

Keep two in the kitty. 

Have no judgements about slutty behavior. 

Don't deny that you like a constant supply of new pussy. Tell her it's ok she likes new dick and you're cool with that.

Take the password off your phone. Don't delete your late night booty calls and pussy pics. 

When she looks through it and shit tests you about it don't be shamed. Just tell her you like fun. 

Unblock the other women that she blocked and tell them, ""sry, crazy girl went through my phone and sent you a fuck off msg"". 

Watch as women who were previously uninterested start sending you nudes and now suddenly they're poly or open to fucking around behind their boyfriend's back. 

Pick up women in front of her. When she complains about it tell her it was only ""harmless flirting"". 

Transparently lie through your fucking teeth in the cheesiest way possible while smirking. 

Be 100 percent unabashed about who you are, and never let her betaization attempts work. 

Simply be a guy who gets a lot of pussy and doesn't hid it and you'll never have a shortage of it.",92,1

Consumption is the prize.," Over the last year most of us have been restricted in some ways as to how we live our lives. Personally it‚Äôs lead me to be more critical of how I‚Äôm spending my time. As such I‚Äôve begun to study the world more than I used to, observing how others are spending theirs. 

As I‚Äôve sat in coffee shops, worked &amp; walked amongst the general population. Listening, analysing what is being said &amp; to what end it will be used. 

A significant veil has been removed. I always presumed that people wanted ‚Äúbetter‚Äù however they wished to define it. But as the population of the west had time to look inwardly. To ask if the life they are living is one which they actually wanted? Most willingly chose to not even ask the question. Even when admitting in other ways to being miserable &amp; unsatisfied. 

When speaking with some NPCs this year about the books they have read (very few) or the Netflix series they ‚Äúwatched‚Äù there was a lack of creative output. Instead of seeing what could be transferred into ‚Äúbettering‚Äù themselves, the again chose to stay in place. Personally from ‚ÄúThe Last Dance‚Äù I took a lot and applied it to improve the way I worked. 

For these people, consumption is the prize. They don‚Äôt see it as fuel to push themselves further towards their goals, if they had any to begin with. 

Ask yourself is the information you‚Äôre consuming being used to push you towards your goals? Is it even capable of it?

Will this help get you laid? Probably not in the here &amp; now. But in the long run, maybe.",83,1
On men being more rational than women,[removed],2,1
Free will is an illusion,"This is my first post here, hope you‚Äôll find it interesting.

In this post I‚Äôll argue that free will is an illusion. This is a summary from Yuval Noah Harari -Homo ‚ÄãDeus chapter 8.

In 2016 the world is dominated by the liberal package of individualism, human rights, democracy and the free market. Yet twenty-first-century science is undermining the foundations of the liberal order. Because science does not deal with questions of value, it cannot determine whether liberals are right in valuing liberty more than equality, or in valuing the individual more than the collective. However, like every other religion, liberalism too is based on what it believes to be factual statements, in addition to abstract ethical judgements. And these factual statements just don‚Äôt stand up to rigorous scientific scrutiny.

Liberals value individual liberty so much because they believe that humans have free will. According to liberalism, the decisions of voters and customers are neither deterministic nor random. People are of course influenced by external forces and chance events, but at the end of the day each of us can wave the magic wand of freedom and decide things for ourselves. This is the reason liberalism gives so much importance to voters and customers, and instructs us to follow our heart and do what feels good. It is our free will that imbues the universe with meaning, and since no outsider can know how you really feel or predict your choices for sure, you shouldn‚Äôt trust any Big Brother to look after your interests and desires.

Attributing free will to humans is *not* an ethical judgement ‚Äì it purports to be a factual description of the world. Although this so-called factual description might have made sense back in the days of Locke, Rousseau and Thomas Jefferson, it does not sit well with the latest findings of the life sciences. The contradiction between free will and contemporary science is the elephant in the laboratory, whom many prefer not to see as they peer into their microscopes and fMRI scanners.

Over the last century, as scientists opened up the Sapiens black box, they discovered there neither soul, nor free will, nor ‚Äòself‚Äô ‚Äì but only genes, hormones and neurons that obey the same physical and chemical laws governing the rest of reality.

Today, when scholars ask why a man drew a knife and stabbed someone death, answering ‚ÄòBecause he chose to‚Äô doesn‚Äôt cut the mustard. Instead, geneticists and brain scientists provide a much more detailed answer: ‚ÄòHe did it due to such-and-such electrochemical processes in the brain, which were shaped by a particular genetic make-up, which reflect ancient evolutionary pressures coupled with chance mutations.‚Äô

The electrochemical brain processes that result in murder are either deterministic or random or a combination of both ‚Äì but they are never free. For example, when a neuron fires an electric charge, this may either be a deterministic reaction to external stimuli, or it might be the outcome of a random event such as the spontaneous decomposition of a radioactive atom. Neither option leaves any room for free will. Decisions reached through a chain reaction of biochemical events, each determined by a previous event, are certainly not free. Decisions resulting from random subatomic accidents aren‚Äôt free either. They are just random. And when random accidents combine with deterministic processes, we get probabilistic outcomes, but this too doesn‚Äôt amount to freedom.

When confronted with such scientific explanations, people often brush them aside, pointing out that they *feel* free, and that they act according to their own wishes and decisions. This is true. Humans act according to their desires. If by ‚Äòfree will‚Äô you mean the ability to act according to your desires ‚Äì then yes, humans have free will, and so do chimpanzees, dogs and parrots. When Polly wants a cracker, Polly eats a cracker. But the million-dollar question is not whether parrots and humans can act out their inner desires ‚Äì the question is whether they can *choose their desires in the first place*. Why does Polly want a cracker rather than a cucumber? Why do I decide to kill my annoying neighbour instead of turning the other cheek? Why do I want to buy the red car rather than the black? I don‚Äôt choose any of these wishes. I feel a particular wish welling up within me because this is the feeling created by the biochemical processes in my brain. These processes might be deterministic or random, but not free.

Doubting free will is not just a philosophical exercise. It has practical implications. If organisms indeed lack free will, it implies we could manipulate and even control their desires using drugs, genetic engineering or direct brain stimulation.

If you want to see philosophy in action, pay a visit to a robo-rat laboratory. A robo-rat is a run-of-the-mill rat with a twist: scientists have implanted electrodes into the sensory and reward areas in the rat‚Äôs brain. This enables the scientists to manoeuvre the rat by remote control. After short training sessions, researchers have managed not only to make the rats turn left or right, but also to climb ladders, sniff around garbage piles, and do things that rats normally dislike, such as jumping from great heights. Armies and corporations show keen interest in the robo-rats, hoping they could prove useful in many tasks and situations. For example, robo-rats could help detect survivors trapped under collapsed buildings, locate bombs and booby traps, and map underground tunnels and caves.

Animal-welfare activists have voiced concern about the suffering such experiments inflict on the rats. Professor Sanjiv Talwar of the State University of New York, one of the leading robo-rat researchers, has dismissed these concerns, arguing that the rats actually enjoy the experiments. After all, explains Talwar, the rats ‚Äòwork for pleasure‚Äô and when the electrodes stimulate the reward centre in their brain, ‚Äòthe rat feels Nirvana‚Äô.

To the best of our understanding, the rat doesn‚Äôt feel that somebody else controls her, and she doesn‚Äôt feel that she is being coerced to do something against her will. When Professor Talwar presses the remote control, the rat *wants* to move to the left, which is why she moves to the left.

(sidenote: Is this image familiar to you, by using social media, tinder, etc?)

TLDR:

\- Free will doesn‚Äôt exist. The electrochemical brain‚Äôs output are either deterministic or random or a combination of both ‚Äì but they are never free.

\- Every animal can follow their desires, so the question is rather can you choose your desires? Because you‚Äôre here, you know the answer.

\- NYC scientist made a robo-rat(living rat modified), so they can control a rat remotely, so they can control the rat to run, turn right/left ,climb a ladder, etc.  To the best of our understanding, the rat doesn‚Äôt feel that somebody else controls her, and she doesn‚Äôt feel that she is being coerced to do something against her will. When the professor presses the remote control, the rat *wants* to move to the left, which is why she moves to the left.",83,1

Theory: Semen Retention Nullifies Oneitis.,"Due to the rather controversial and polarizing nature of SR; I'll preface with the obvious that my hypothesis stems from the subjective, there is no tangible way to prove or disprove what I'm saying. You do you.

In college, I became self aware of how porn addiction was limiting my potential and cut the strokage to a few times a week with my imagination or softcore pics once in a blue moon. Appeared to propel me in a relatively TRP mode of interacting with the world; eyes on the purpose, hustle, fuck, don't sweat anyone's opinion (especially a woman's), etc. But that all went out the window with a few broads that could very well could have been succubus's sent from the pits of eternal suffering haha; from falsified domestic violence charges with self inflicted wounds to drug fueled power trips that make Mao look sane, I truly felt their wrath... These woman broke me, though their insanity is precisely what got me obsessed and I brought it all upon myself; I knew exactly what I was getting myself into.. Anyhow, long story short; I could not help but question myself through the years of how I could descend to such desperation and need for control with these women and continue to fuck up.. Logically, I could tear it apart from a distance; but there was something compromising my very fiber in the heat of it all that I could not put my finger on.. Sure enough, it was staring my nuts right in the face.

I came across an article a year back about training your kegels to prevent ejaculating, dramatically reduce your refractory period, and multiple orgasms. The author seemed truthful and I thought why not? Though it did seem a little too good to be true.. But hey, sure enough; I got the hang of it in a week or so and my mind was absolutely rattled.  It felt the exact same as actually unleashing and you aren't a closeted homosexual for the next five minutes after cummin haha. You just keep on going on going till one of you are physically drained.. Sweet Jesus, the first woman I fucked may have loss motor function from the waist down haha; the ravenous bewilderment of this theory being put to action amidst my eyes was something else...

The more I refrained from release, the further detached I became. Met some great women and savored their beauty, though was not subconsciously consumed by it for the first time in my life. Felt like surfing a wave in a sense, on to the next. Then my greatest challenge came 2 months into the journey, Cassandra... A body sculpted by the grimiest hands in Hollywood with the utmost craftsmanship, past the wall yet absolutely pristine. She approached me actually and I had the suspicion she was a prostitute, but na - just a lonely MILF with a good heart. I couldn't resist the urge to nut with this one.. And man o man, the proceeding days were pathetic haha. Imagining absurdities way down the line, convincing myself she is the one, absolutely consumed by what just happened; the exact opposite heading over to her apartment.. Then I put it all together, she milked me dry of my [preciously bodily fluids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1KvgtEnABY). I formulated that my body was under the impression she was the women intended to raise my children on a physiological level, therefore, this was all an illusion.. I got back on the retention train and sure enough, Cassandra became just another plate and I wasn't stressin one bit from the raw intimidation of her SMV. We were two totally different people and lust was the fundamental derivative of our interaction; nothing more, nothing less.

Since then (7 months), I can hardly formulate words to describe the fine line of indifference and freedom that commitment to SR conjures. It's so surreal, sex just feels like surfing.. Always another wave, never time to think about my last ride, and enjoying every spot for the unique wave that it creates. The antithesis of onetitis it appears.. I still very much care and empathize with the women that come my way, it's not as if I've relinquished my capacity to feel; but rather, I can see the trivial nature of it all and am becoming increasingly more consumed with finding the woman for which I can unleash my seed. Maybe not the antithesis of oneitis then haha? Not that I am anywhere close to having children (24), the desire has only materialized rather recently with my SR journey and still something I have to fuly grasp. Though that appears to be my purpose and not the frivolous poundage of my lil guy for momentary pleasure.. A concept that my brain with the proclivity for nihilism could never really ever grasp, why waste the money/time/potential heart break on some mini me I'd always wonder.. But fuck me, it's what I'm wired to do I reckon and there is no defying the mechanics at be..

I'm not sure what else there is to type; maybe I'm deluded and making inferences from temporary emotions, maybe there is factual reasoning for my shift in perspective. I really don't know, I'm a professional poker player and not a scientist in the slightest. Though if you can relate or see the semblance of logic in my hypothesis, hopefully my ramblings can help in some variant or another.

What is ATTRACTION and how does it work?,"**Sex is like editing together a documentary film.** Everything is based in reality, but it‚Äôs up to you to put together the story. Initial attraction may be there, but if you don‚Äôt string things together the right way, you‚Äôre not getting laid.

Both sexes have their role in building this narrative. It‚Äôs too easy to reduce the female‚Äôs role to that of a movie goer or theater attendee; ‚Äújust start the damn show and hope I don‚Äôt walk out.‚Äù Although there is truth to that dynamic, the woman has her part in showing up *fit for the performance*.

If she‚Äôs had the bad luck of being out with a beta-doofus, only minimal effort is required. The slightest exertion of feminine prowess will allow her total control of the situation. These aesthetic stakes will rise along-side the value of the man interested. By the time she shows up to the date, he‚Äôll already know if he wants to fuck her or not- from there, as long as she doesn‚Äôt commit an egregious, narrative disrupting crime of anti-sexuality, her job is mostly done- any further action on her part is for sport.

**As a man falls under the aesthetic spell of a woman, he‚Äôll construct the rest of the narrative on his own with very little input from her.** Did she try to make a joke? It‚Äôs hysterical! Did she make a rather obvious observation? She‚Äôs so smart! Is there any kind of minor nuance to her behavior that can be focused on and doted over? She‚Äôs adorable!

His misguided interpretation of her qualities will remain until his attraction for her has been extinguished, which may be accompanied by feelings of sadness, guilt, shame, or even disgust, depending on the particulars of the situation.

Since anything beyond her aesthetic may be his narrative imposing on reality, there isn‚Äôt a lingering question of *authenticity*. Ironically, the authenticity of her beauty is actually debatable- women have an entire arsenal of weapons to deceive the gullible- however, most men are only looking for surface level approval.

Conversely, **authenticity is a central question for her- an on-going issue to which her attraction to him is contingent upon.**

She will also see what she wants and lie to herself, but rather than constructing a false narrative based on his aesthetic, she magnifies the fragments of his personality that she finds attractive and comes to the conclusion that he ‚Äúmust always be like that.‚Äù

This is as much a na√Øve fantasy as his personifying her beauty into the idealized girlfriend. While he‚Äôs putting his *best foot forward* on their date in an attempt to have a sex worthy alpha male performance, she‚Äôs going along for the ride believing that he‚Äôs being himself and this decisive, assertive, cool and confident guy is *just who he is*.

Only it isn‚Äôt so easy- women are savvier in this department than men. **She‚Äôll subconsciously match his behavior to what he looks like while trying to determine if he should be entitled to acting so decisive, assertive, cool and confident.** And if this scan turns up negative, she‚Äôll think he‚Äôs faking his swagger and aggressively (shit) test the depth of his authenticity.

If he‚Äôs able to hold this frame together for long enough, he‚Äôll get laid.

___

**Lesson:** Everything is narrative- everything is a story we construct and tell ourselves- and this starts from the first interaction, each and every date, the entire relationship, through to the break-up. It's all just story- for you to enjoy, for you to agonize over- but always make sure it frame it in proper terms; just a story we made up to tell ourselves.

"GOALS: Trust the process. Pinpoint where you are, and press through.","I can tell you from experience the frustration that comes from not seeing results right away. Training yourself for delayed gratification in everything you do becomes particularly important as a result.

You‚Äôve got to trust the process in the mean time. And, I‚Äôve come to realize there are several layers to this, and so I shall explain them now. This is for all of you struggling... seeing a roadmap will help you pin point where you are now and break through. 


THE FIRST STEP:

You want something, and begin to think about how you can get it. For example, more women, more money, more friends, a better body.

THE SECOND STEP: 

You begin to search for information or try things you think of to get you towards your new goal.

THE THIRD STEP:

You begin to implement these things, and maybe have some short term success. However, things either start to slow down, or in some cases they never started to begin with. Sometimes, the effects of your actions can actually push you backwards.

THE FORTH STEP:

You begin bargaining. You may tell yourself you don‚Äôt need to reach the goal, that it‚Äôs too hard. This is the crucial part because you will see a lot of people give up here. It‚Äôs only the strong that will push themselves towards their goal after this step. The ego, the looking glass self, and your ideologies all start to clash. Some people deny their current circumstances and validate themselves through some means. The world can really start to fuck with your process, especially if you start talking about your goal with people. 

Side note: never, ever, talk about your goals with people you know. I compare this to busting your nut before sticking it in the hole. If you tell people about your goals, it will actually validate and fulfill you, causing you to put forth less effort towards the goal. 

THE FIFTH STEP:

You have either given up at this point, or put your idea on the back burner. You validate yourself by saying, ‚Äúit will take more time, but I‚Äôll get there.‚Äù 

THE SIXTH STEP:

You begin trying new things, or add things into your process in order to speed up the results. 


THE SEVENTH STEP:

You start to see some actionable results, and boom, the ignition switch is hit. Here is the sweet spot and likely where you will make the greater amount of progress. 


THE EIGHTH STEP: 

You are satisfied with your goal. You either want more from your goal, or you want to start something new.


THE LAST STEP:

You may decrease the attention you have given to that goal, so you see a decrease in your results. Here the process starts back over. Additionally, major life changes or changes in your ideology can also cause you to dump the goal altogether.",33,1

Getting my needs met,"I want to share what I asked from a chick last week, please share your thoughts.

The chick came over, we had something to eat, and quickly went into the bedroom. We fucked three times because I was horny as fuck but she was not giving at all. No blowjob, no anal. She did not even shave her pussy. I tried to make her relax in bed by giving her a massage and that helped a little. I also told her that it is ok to let go, but she didn't. Still, I enjoyed it as much as I could. She wanted cuddling and romanticism after...

Two days later she texted me and wanted to meet again, so I told her:

*Look, I don't think we are going to get along that well in one particular aspect. I think we have very different tastes in bed. I like women that are more active and open-minded, which includes anal, oral, spanking, tying you up, and playing with toys. I think you are more on the ""romantic"" vibe, which is fine because we are all different. Anyway, I want you to know this because I enjoy being more dominant and you didn't look comfortable with that.*

Her response: *Surely a man with your qualities will find a woman that likes all that. Best luck in your search.*

\---

I do not want to waste time having mediocre sex so I know I needed to convey that. I wonder if I could have communicated it better. I was thinking in ARC ""mode one"" style when I sent that...Elephant in the room: she did not give me her sexual best, because I am not alpha enough in her eyes.

Met a girl in the Elevator yesterday and added her on Snapchat. Sent her a message last night and she still hasn't opened it. Should I be worried?,"It's been over 20 hours now lol

Backstory: I live in an off campus apartment near my college. Im 20 and have never been in a relationship before. So yesterday I took the elevator to pick up a package and there was a girl inside. She was literally exactly my type physically. So we're in the elevator and she says ""Sorry that i dont have my mask on"". We both laugh and I respond saying that it's ok. I then ask her how her day is going and from there a conversation striked up and I found out that we had some stuff in common (similar major, same classes) and then we happened to both be going to the mail room to pick up a package so the conversation continued and we talked about various other things like dealing with covid etc. So I then asked her if she has snapchat and she responds saying yes so I add her on there. 


I then said my goodbyes to her and wished her well.  So later that day around 7 pm I messaged her on snapchat saying i enjoyed talking toher and was wondering if she wanted to go out on Sunday for ice cream. It's currently 5 pm and she hasnt even opened the message (it still says delivered) lol. Do yall think she isnt interested? I feel like she also isnt on snapchat that often because her snap score didnt increase at all today.",11,1
Enjoy Your Turn,"""See I cast 'em and I past 'em 
Get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and out last 'em
And if it ain't good then I trash 'em"" 

- Ludacris 

Here in TRP we have a saying that goes ""She's not yours it's just your turn,"" and we have dudes here that say that mantra over and over. 

So they instead turn neurotic as all hell, log on to Reddit and go to askTRP and say shit like ""Hey TRP my LTR is laughing with a coworker and they're getting real chummy with each other what do I do???"" 

Enjoy your turn. 

Did her pussy magically seal up? Did her mouth get gagged? Is her ass sealed off? Did her hands fall off? No? Aight then, keep fucking her. 

If it stops bein good...then you trash em üóë. 

If she's fuckin up everything 24/7 creating drama cause she's a dumb hoe then trash em'. 

Even with LTRs it's easy to just let go of the bullshit and enjoy yourself regardless of what's going on. If she fucks it all up so what? Put her ass in the trash and move on, or put her in the recycling bin and hit her up for some fun later.

Your ""turn"" can end at any point and time. But then in three, four, five, or six months time she can come right back around and your ""turn"" will begin again. That's how you keep a revolving door of bitches. Not by being neurotic and going nuclear. 

Remember, once you've fucked her, **you got the power.** Either she will enjoy her time with you and push for commitment, keep coming back for NSA sex, or she will phase herself out of your life. 

So stop the whining and the crying and learn to proceed as normal. Don't let these bitches control you and act like you have some nuts.",18,1

Date women your self esteem can handle.,"It‚Äôs easy to LARP online as some dude that isn‚Äôt fazed by anything, and that‚Äôs ready to leave any woman at any time no matter the situation, but it doesn‚Äôt always play out that way in real life. 

It‚Äôs a known scientific fact that men act retarded around hot women(HB9‚Äôs and the like), and will make excuses for why they haven‚Äôt left her yet if she acts up. 

Your average looking woman will get more male attention in her life than you can imagine. But she‚Äôs not getting top shelf. She‚Äôs attainable, so most men trying to hit on her aren‚Äôt gonna be that much of a threat. 

Sure, Chad might fuck her for a one night stand occasionally, but she‚Äôll most likely get alpha widowed.

Enter the HB9. She‚Äôs pedestalized constantly, betas are afraid to talk to her, and while she‚Äôs not as attainable as the average girl, the caliber of men talking to her is on a different level.

She‚Äôll get asked out by rich business men to fly out with them on ‚Äúvacations‚Äù, she‚Äôll have sugar daddies offer large sums for no effort on her part, and she has an army of orbiters. 

All this is fine, don‚Äôt hate the game, it is what it is. 

But don‚Äôt play if you‚Äôre gonna be a little bitch about it either. I‚Äôve seen too many guys chase the hot girl of their dreams, only to end up fucked up by all the attention and propositions she was getting. 

I‚Äôm not telling you to lower your standards, fuck no. But understand that if LTR‚Äôs are red pill on hard mode, then LTR‚Äôs with a top shelf piece are a nightmare if your SMV and confidence aren‚Äôt up to par. 

If you aren‚Äôt ready or willing to break up and leave that kind of girl when she fucks up, you shouldn‚Äôt be dating at all. Spin plates until you shake off the hot girl retardation effect, then maybe play again in the future.",123,1

RedPill Movies? (Crazy Stupid Love Spoiler),"Just landed in Miami and realized there is so fucking few movies that showcase Red Pill Philosophy, at least not without fucking it up towards the end.

Case in point.

I watched Crazy Stupid Love on the plane here and it is excellent in terms of showcasing game. And is able to transform a schmuck like Steve Carell into a man who is able to pull 9 lays, after 20 years of porking the same women. Of course after she cheat on the poor bastard.

Basically, be aloof, ask her questions to get her talking about herself, get her to prove to you that she's interesting, keep yourself mysterious. Don't dress like a schmuck. Don't project a lack of worth. Am I missing anything for those who are familiar with the film?

Another point I thought was brilliant was selective honesty with the right women can ALSO get you laid. Steve's first lay is with a woman who is ""tired"" of all the players and wants brutal honesty, and it get's him his first lay in the movie! I can attest to this when I was originally blue pilled and I literally poured my heart out about a girl who fucked me up and instead of repelling her she decided to call me ""papi"" for two consecutive nights as I busted sad nuts into her.

BUT HOLY FUCK NUTS DOES IT DERAIL ITSELF IN THE THIRD ACT.

So let me get this straight. Steve Carell is able to pull the hottest women he will ever pull, at an age where he's already spread his seed. He has children and doesn't need more. And can live a free agent lifestyle. But the moral of the story is that he should give his cheating wife a SECOND CHANCE despite her infidelity? I can maybe see her being re-attracted after realizing Steve has become a player. But it barely makes sense from his perspective. Am I missing something?

Also moral of the story is to never quit and never give up on love?? The entire movie his loser son is pining over a girl, and is constantly rejected and instead of improving himself or his game. Is the just keep pursuing the unicorn. And at the end of it he's rewarded with nudes for doing the same thing and constantly embarrassing himself publicly professing his love. Also can we acknowledge the fact that its a 17 year old giving nudes to potentially his dad, but ultimately to his 14 year old son. Man this movie has some messed up priorities...

Where the hell are fully RedPilled Movies, are there any? At least more that get it half right like Crazy Stupid Love? There's Spread with Ashton Kutcher which is also brilliant for 3/4th of the movie and then it derails when moral is that men apparently have a shelf life too in the dating game, which is absolute bull...

TLDR; Looking for more RedPill Movies, or at the very least Purple Pill like Crazy Stupid Love/Spread that will set men in the general right direction....",10,1
Red Pill Movies? (Crazy Stupid Love Spoilers),[removed],2,1
You‚Äôre not Obligated to Have Sex with a Girl,"A tonne of guys (and girls) struggle with this one, even though on paper it‚Äôs so simple:

**You‚Äôre never under any obligation to have sex with someone ‚Äì and you shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty about ‚Äúleading someone on‚Äù &amp; later changing your mind.**

# Don't cut girls off too early

Having a girl back at your place doesn‚Äôt mean you HAVE to fuck her. You are allowed to, even at the very last minute, decide you‚Äôre not going to put your penis inside her. Crazy thought, I know.

But it‚Äôs something a tonne of guys struggle with when they first start dating girls. They feel like, ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm not super attracted to the girl right off the bat, I should be a gentleman and cut things off with her immediately.‚Äù

By doing so, you‚Äôre robbing yourself of:

a) The chance at some desperately-needed dating experience.

b) The chance to potentially ‚Äúwarm up to her‚Äù and find her attractive as you spend more time with her (or consume more beers‚Ä¶)

As I‚Äôve said before, if you‚Äôre a newbie, you need dating experience as much of it as you can get. So go on as many dates as you can ‚Äì including girls you aren‚Äôt super keen on having sex with. Yes, I‚Äôm advising you to go on dates with girls you‚Äôre not super into, solely for the much-needed experience.

Learn how to hold hands and practice it with lots of different girls, figure out how to kiss them, learn how to invite them back to your place, learn how to makeout and fool around. You need practice ‚Äì lots of practice ‚Äì with all of these things in order to be comfortable getting to the sex part.

&amp;#x200B;

# ‚ÄúBut Andy! That‚Äôs leading her on!‚Äù

You‚Äôre not ‚Äúleading her on‚Äù. You‚Äôre interviewing ‚Äì seeing if you like her, seeing if she likes you, seeing how far you both want to go with things. You haven‚Äôt signed a contract saying you‚Äôre definitely going to see her for more dates. You haven‚Äôt signed a contract saying you‚Äôre definitely going to kiss her. And you haven‚Äôt signed a contract saying you‚Äôre definitely going to have sex with her.

Getting laid a lot ‚Äì whether just for the sake of getting lots of lays, or because you‚Äôre searching for a girlfriend or fuckbuddy ‚Äì means you have to ‚Äúinterview‚Äù a lot of potential candidates. That inevitably means a lot of girls won‚Äôt fit your criteria, or you won‚Äôt vibe with them, etc ‚Äì and you‚Äôll have to let them go. You can‚Äôt give the job position to the very first person who asks for it.

Girls do the exact same thing ‚Äì they go on dates to figure out if they like the guy, and see if they want to go any further. They know each date is just two people‚Äôs figuring out if they click, with no obligation to go any further if they don‚Äôt want to.

When you remove this pressure from yourself ‚Äì this expectation that you should only be on dates with girls you‚Äôre absolutely sure you want to bang ‚Äì dating becomes so much easier. You‚Äôre more laid back, more carefree, and you no longer stress about how ‚Äúawkward‚Äù things might be if you decide you don‚Äôt want to go any further with her. You stop feeling guilty about potentially wasting people‚Äôs time.

Because that‚Äôs what dating is ‚Äì two people figuring out if they want to go further. How can you know the answer to that question until after you‚Äôve spent a bit of time in each other‚Äôs company?

Taking the pressure off yourself to have sex will also open you up to new experiences, because you won‚Äôt be thinking so far ahead into the future. Guys tend to think, ‚ÄúCould I see myself banging this girl?‚Äù or ‚ÄúCould I see myself dating this girl and introducing her to my friends?‚Äù Woah, cowboy ‚Äì chill a little. The only question you need to ask yourself is, ‚ÄúAm I happy with the stage we‚Äôre at now; am I enjoying being with her in this moment, right now?‚Äù

If the answer to that is yes, then keep hanging out. Stop thinking into the future and worrying that at some point you might stop enjoying her company. If right now feels right, then be in the moment and enjoy it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Some Girls Will Win You Over

Instead of stressing about the future and talking yourself out of going on dates, you should always keep an open mind ‚Äì I‚Äôve had some amazing experiences with girls [I initially had no interest in](https://killyourinnerloser.com/always-keep-an-open-mind/).

You should be saying yes to every opportunity that presents itself ‚Äì yes to every girl who‚Äôs happy to spend time with you. Don‚Äôt turn down girls for arbitrary reasons ‚Äì especially when you‚Äôre in the beginner or intermediate stage of getting laid. Say yes to everything, and then figure out during the actual date how you feel about the girl.

Some of my absolute best experiences were with girls I didn‚Äôt initially want to meet up with for a date. I had to talk myself into keeping an open mind, reminded myself, ‚ÄúYou need all the experience you can get‚Äù. I‚Äôm so glad I did, because some of those girls turned out to be absolute sweethearts &amp; some of them were bloody amazing in bed.

It‚Äôs nuts to think I very nearly robbed myself of some of my best sexual and life experiences, because I was worried about not being attracted to them further down the line.

&amp;#x200B;

# If I Do Decide I want to End Things‚Ä¶ How do I do that?

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve kept an open mind, been on a date with a girl, maybe even had sex with her ‚Äì but you decide you don‚Äôt want to progress any further or see her again. How the hell do you handle it?

This was something I struggled with for a number of years. I felt bad every time I ‚Äúrejected‚Äù a girl, feeling like I‚Äôd led her on &amp; wasted her time. I knew how bad it hurt when a girl ghosted me or turned me down, and I hated ‚Äì no, I resented ‚Äì having to do the same thing to them.

I handled it horribly for the most part ‚Äì usually choosing to just ghost (not text her at all). All because I was too awkward to do the decent thing and send a polite text message turning her down. I‚Äôve learned from my mistakes and don‚Äôt do that any more.

If you decide while you‚Äôre on a date with a girl that you‚Äôre done for the night &amp; don‚Äôt want to go any further, just use my line: ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs call it a night. I‚Äôll walk you back to the train station/your car.‚Äù

Walk her back to the car/train station, and see how you feel about it the next day. If you decide you don‚Äôt want to see her any more, text her a simple:

‚ÄúHey, I had a tonne of fun but feel like the chemistry wasn‚Äôt quite there. I‚Äôm really glad I got to meet you, all the best.‚Äù

Saying ‚Äúthe chemistry wasn‚Äôt quite there‚Äù softens the blow a lot ‚Äì you‚Äôre blaming something external (lack of chemistry) rather than saying it‚Äôs her fault. Normally I‚Äôm a proponent of raw honesty, but this is one time when it‚Äôs best to phrase it in a nicer way. Sometimes a white lie is nicer than a black truth. There‚Äôs no need to be a raging dick ‚Äì remember, we‚Äôre not out to hurt any girl‚Äôs feelings.

All of this applies even if you‚Äôve already had sex with a girl. After you bang, if you‚Äôre not really that attracted to her or don‚Äôt vibe with her personality, you are under no obligation to see her again. You have nothing to feel guilty about if you decide to end things. Just shoot her a casual, ‚ÄúHey, I had a lot of fun last night‚Äù and leave it at that. If she messages you wanting to meet up again, just use the same line as above ‚Äì ‚ÄúI had a tonne of fun but feel like the chemistry wasn‚Äôt quite there. I‚Äôm really glad I got to meet you, all the best.‚Äù

This even applies if you‚Äôve previously told her, ‚ÄúI hate one night stands‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never do a one night stand‚Äù. When you said that, what you really meant was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never deliberately seek out a one-night-stand. If I like a girl &amp; the sex is good, I‚Äôll always want to see her again.‚Äù But how were you ever going to know if the sex was good until you actually had sex?

If you decide the sex was horrible &amp; you definitely don‚Äôt want to see her again, ask yourself, ‚ÄúAm I keeping an open mind, or cutting her off too soon?‚Äù If the answer to that is ‚ÄúI definitely don‚Äôt want to see her again‚Äù, then don‚Äôt feel bad about having a one-night-stand. Sometimes the chemistry just isn‚Äôt there; sometimes the sex is just awful. It is ok for you not to see a girl again after you have sex with her.

# Girls Inherently Understand this Concept

Girls are used to being in the position of choice ‚Äì so they understand inherently it‚Äôs fine to not keep seeing a guy, for whatever reason. ‚ÄúMy body, my choice‚Äù ‚Äì obviously. They understand dates are for figuring out if you click with someone &amp; deciding if you want to sleep with someone or not. They also understand even after you‚Äôve banged, you‚Äôre under no obligation to see each other a second time ‚Äì especially if the sexual chemistry wasn‚Äôt there.

But guys struggle with this, because ‚Äì at least at the start ‚Äì most of us:

a) Aren‚Äôt used to turning down any girls, and thus feel guilty for doing it.

b) Often have never even considered that we‚Äôre allowed to reject a girl we‚Äôre not super into. It‚Äôs a foreign concept.

And to be fair, some girls don‚Äôt handle rejection all that well‚Ä¶

So take a page out of the female handbook, and give yourself permission to gain some dating experience with girls you‚Äôre not all that attracted to ‚Äì and to end things with them when you feel you don‚Äôt want to continue.

Women are creatures of the present,"A friend of mine was surprised when I showed him the anecdotes of a man that worked as a male entertainer in bachelor parties for some years. The stripper went on and on about women and their herd mentality, how they would take turns to blow the same dick, how they would do threesomes with the strippers. Single women, women with BF, maids, you name it. 

My friend, in his effort to rationalize these situations, tried to consider them as an exception when they are in fact the rule. To explain this to him, I came to this reflection of women's nature:

Women are creatures that live in the present, meaning they are incapable of taking ownership of their past and incapable of iterating and premeditate the future consequences of their actions. This is why the wall hit them as a surprise, and why they realize they screwed everything up once the damage is already done. They see the rubble and smoke of their destruction in the present and want to repair the damage, with actions that usually end up doing more damage, because they want the repair to be to their benefit, not to actually amend the harm.

Also, this ""here and now"" immature way of living is why they demand men and society to accommodate their decisions to the life situation they are in: SMV peak-party/travel, epiphany-commitment/pregnancy, single mother-man up. They consider the other party as a necessary accessory to satisfy their need, instead of going in to give.  

Their solipsism is grounded in the ""here and now"". They want all the authority, without the responsibility. Only the presence of a strong masculine figure in the house as they grow up can teach them to control those natural impulses with an understanding of life in the long term, investment, commitment. They need to be tamed down, essentially.

One trait that distinguishes alphas from betas,"Doing whatever the fuck you want. That‚Äôs it. Allow me to elaborate.

I have read countless threads on asktrp that could simply be solved by asking OP: well, what is it that **you** wanna do? 

Alphas make their own decisions and they make these decisions with confidence. They don‚Äôt seek the approval of others before making their decisions. They trust their intuition, they know exactly what it is they desire and their decisions back this up.

Let‚Äôs consider a hypothetical yet very practical and common scenario: you‚Äôre on tinder and you match with a bitch. 

Beta behavior: running to the asktrp sub and requesting advice on how to respond, how to ask for her number, whatever.

Alpha behavior: responding how you like and then moving on with your day regardless of the outcome. I think there‚Äôs even a term for this...

I see so many guys consult the asktrp sub about what how an alpha would respond, whether or not this is beta behavior, how to handle that situation as an alpha, whatever. 

Let me tell you, you‚Äôve already lost the battle once you reach that stage. Think of the chaddiest most alpha motherfucker you know. Do you think he‚Äôs bitching about how his date went? Or do you think he simply learned some lessons and moved on to his other options? Do you think he‚Äôs spending his time and attention mentally masturbating over trivial details regarding a social situation? Or do you think he‚Äôs too busy killing it at life to give a fuck?

True alphas aren‚Äôt running to an Internet forum to seek approval before they act. They aren‚Äôt consulting strangers on the internet to tell them how to handle a certain situation. They don‚Äôt need to be told what‚Äôs acceptable and what‚Äôs not. You know what‚Äôs really alpha? Making your own fucking decisions because it‚Äôs your fucking life.

Next time, before you consult the sun or anybody in your life for that matter simply ask yourself: What is it that I want to do? And just fucking do it. 

The asktrp sub is designed for you to obtain multiple and different perspectives so you can gather information that‚Äôll ultimately help you make better decisions on your own. It isn‚Äôt meant to hold your hand and guide you through life. It‚Äôs designed to teach you how to fish better instead of placing the fish gently into your hands.

A numbers-based approach being in the top 20 percent of guys financially and sexually,"So as I‚Äôve explored redpill and manosphere content, I‚Äôve repeatedly come across the 80/20 rule and other guys in the community saying to be in the top 20% of men. I had trouble grasping this idea because a lot of the descriptions of what constitutes a top 20% man were subjective, varied from guy to guy, seemed to be emotionally devised, and involved this thing called ‚Äúgame‚Äù. Being a numbers-oriented and emotionally dumb guy (I have had people call me a ‚Äúrobot‚Äù, ‚Äúsociopath‚Äù, and ‚Äúpsychopath‚Äù and people have told me I have low ‚Äúemotional intelligence‚Äù), these descriptions of a top 20% man did not make sense to me. I had to do my own research, dumb things down for myself, figure out what I considered a top 20% man, and devised my own method to be in the top 20% of men financially and sexually. I came up with a simple definition of what constitutes a top 20% man. My technique is inspired by some of Blackdragon‚Äôs (AKA Caleb Jones) material and is devised by combining his material, other random manosphere/redpill stuff I‚Äôve read, with some research on percentiles I‚Äôve done on my own.

Being in the top 20% financially:

To be in the top 20% financially, you need to be able to pull off two things:

1) Make an pre-tax income that is in the top 20% in your geographic region. In the United States this is around $85k pre-tax in 2020. If you want, you can granulize the region further down to things like your state and possibly your city. [This](https://dqydj.com/average-median-top-individual-income-percentiles/) is the website I use to find percentage data on things like incomes and net worth. The fastest way to do this is to either run a high-margin business or work a high paying job and job hop until you get there.

2) Have a net worth that is in the top 20% for your age bracket, if you are 35 and over. I exempt guys under 35 because they are still trying to build wealth and figure out how to manage their money. That said, it is a good idea to focus on building your net worth as soon as possible. In the USA, this means a net worth of $200-300k (depending on whether you include home equity) in 2020 for guys who are 35-39. [This link](https://dqydj.com/net-worth-by-age-calculator-united-states/#What_was_the_average_and_median_net_worth_by_age_in_2020) gives net worth percentiles in the USA for different age brackets. The fastest way to do this is the speculate part of your dollars into things like stocks and Bitcoin (only if you‚Äôre young like me).

Note that income and net worth increase slightly every year because the US govt likes to print money and cause inflation so it is up to you to keep up with that.


Being in the top 20% sexually:

To be in the top 20% of men sexually, you have to fuck the number of girls that puts you in the top 20%. If you‚Äôre 35, this number is 22 girls. Yes, most men don‚Äôt sleep with that many girls in their 20s, so if you‚Äôve surpassed that number in your 20s, congrats you‚Äôre a young slayer. The easiest, cheapest, and fastest way to sleep with that many girls is to pay 22 different hookers (now yes I know some of you more emotional guys think paying for pussy is ‚Äúbeta‚Äù or ‚Äúfor losers‚Äù, y‚Äôall can kindly fuck off). In my area this only costs about $6500 for 22 young model quality hookers. If you want to do PUA/game to sleep with that many women, go ahead but personally I find PUA/game to be time consuming for fucking a certain number of girls. I consider PUA/game a good idea if all you want to do to keep the same 2 girls on rotation. [This](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/moneybox/2015/05/sex_history_calculator_is_your_number_of_sexual_partners_low_average_or.html) is the calculator I used to determine sex partner percentiles.


After you do all of this, you can take the rest of your life off and not have to worry about money or bitches because you ‚Äúmade it‚Äù. All you have to do is worry about managing your net worth and keeping a rotation of 2 hot bitches for wham bam thank you maam sex.

If you want to aim for a higher percentile, like top 10% or top 5%, go ahead. But realize you‚Äôll have to put in maybe double or triple the effort as you would to hit the top 20% of men as climbing higher up the ladder gets progressively harder",30,1

Why being a Bartender forces you to be social and how ii affects your life (Part 2),"So you probably ask yourself ""Why the fuck I want to be a bartender and how its helping me in day today life?

Perks of a bartenders:

its not a secret woman love bartenders there is a couple of reasons for it.
1)  we have supiriority and sense of commanding 
2)  people talk to us a lot! and how is your vibe with other people is important as precieved to other people.
3) We serve the drinks that make people fucked up and they will always try to get our attention 
4) Being friends with the manager is really good for multiple reasons
5) Woman fucking love us after all we pour them drinks and sometimes if they are behaving good we give them chasers for the later stuff...
6) Men will try to be friends with you 
7) Really good money! all depends on you
8) Woman will flirt with you a lot( Part 3 will be focused on this topic) maybe they want a free drink maybe they want to get laid all depends on your game
9) you are forced to be social and improve your confidience a lot! 
10) your social expirience will translate to other aspects of life.

I will talk about the cons and how its good for you to handle them in Part 3.

Being forced to be social is good: 

You see, As a bartender I am sort of have to be social.
It makes you to be social no matter how afraid you are talking to people, after all being a bartender has to do with social dynamics between you and your customers. If you want to get tips and money and keep pouring drinks you have to be a likeble guy, charismatic, with a chill vibe.
You have to be a professional at your work doing no matter what happens.

You see this hot blonde coming over the bar? yeah that girl that want you to make her a drink? you will be forced to talk to her, you will be put into position of your discomfort when interacting with her asking ""Hey how are you doing, what can I get you?"" you can't stutter or show how discomforting it is for you because it is your work after all. you will meet shit ton of guys, girls, married woman, single broken guys, etc. 
you will find yourself talking to some of them and hear their life stories if you want to. We all know that feeling when someone is there to listen to our problems.

Now Iam not talking about pausing your job and listen the whole evening to the girl/guy but you get what Iam saying, time is money after all.

after a while it becomes your second nature. You will be asked questions, you will be talking to people even small chit chat, and you will get paid accordingly how you come off as a professional bartender or as a side job.
If you smile and look positive as a peraon people will be drawn to you, its the nature of humans.
No one wants to be near depressing sad people.

How you come to work and why it matters:

first impression is always the strongest even before someone open their mouth. How you present yourself its how people will precieve you, its a big plus coming to your job well groomed, shaved (or beard what ever) smelling good and having fiting clothes on you.
Lets take me for example I have always came to my bartending work with white/black buttoned shirt, Black chino pants, clean black elegent boots but comfortable, a good perfume/cologne that fits me, and a good hairstyle that fits the face. The amount of compilamnts I got from woman, men, girls, guys, group of people is amazing! 

How to behave as a bartender:

Smile, not a forced one like a fucking creep... but a welcoming on a warm smile when a custumor comes 
I always ask ""Hey how are you doing?"" sometimes I even compliment on their clothes or accesories and they are instantly like me and its sparks a conversation, I met a lot of interesting people over my 2 months of working.
Always ask for their name and try to remember it.
We all love to be called by our names it gives a feel of familiarity. 
Remember you are at work and have to be professional about it but also easy cheerful and chill.

TRP example from a past popular video,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T\_lh5fR4DMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_lh5fR4DMA)

Men and women can't be ""just friends"" unless the guy is really not attracted to the women, but if this were the case he probably wouldn't want to interact with her at all if he's not interested in sleeping with her, or would if she gave him the chance.

However notice all of the women in this video originally thought that men and women could be just friends because they collected orbiters and did not see their friends in a sexual way (or weren't having sex with those friends YET).

It's best to look in the past *(a decade ago... since women are very weird and hyper post feminist world now &amp; both men &amp; women will mostly give unauthentic responses that they think about)*. As men continue to be more feminine and girls continue to be more masculine every decade in colleges they might feel sexually restricted, be too afraid to even tell their girl ""friends"" they would love to bang them in fear of losing the friendship, its in women's best interest to have guy ""friends"" and as many as she can have without them expecting sex while she searches for someone to bend over for. It introduces them to more guys, and they get all the male attention they could want (though its never enough to satisfy them). While also cultivating an abundance mentality &amp; being able to make more guys jealous or willing to pay for \*\*\*\*, simp for them, wait for sex.

TRP goes back decades, hundreds of years, thousands of years, its timeless. The disney fantasy was nothing but a fantasy.

My take on Alpha's and Beta archetypes,[removed],2,1
Stop apologizing to others and apologize to yourself,"Hello everyone, hope you beautiful bastards are having a fantastic start to 2020! Ah the irony.

Today I want to talk about the one thing that I stopped doing that has literally changed me the most and that I recommend you try. **Disclaimer:** this should be used per your discretion in leu of context.

**Intro**

I was helping my friends younger brother build a PC over the weekend. Although I have been slowly mentoring my friend (who is younger than me), it hasn't rubbed off on his brother. One of the things he kept doing all the time was saying sorry or ""my bad"". I told him to cut it out several times but holly shit was it annoying. ""These are your parts, you spent your 2000$ on this, so if shit goes wrong, its on you, apologize to yourself, not me for fucks sake"". And it was true, I was simply making sure he didn't break anything, but every time I told him to do something a different way, or in any way guided him differently than he expected, he would apologize. Okay, sure, I am older, but not by enough to where he should be this courteous. So here begins my small lecture.

**First**, lets discuss to when you absolutely need to apologize, and when you shouldn't. 

When you fucked up with the bros, the home boys, your best friends, the dudes, what ever. There is nothing more correct than to apologize man to man. There is nothing weak about this, as a real apology, after a real fuck up, is normal and should be done. You should not apologize of sticking it to them when they fucked up. Men (at least around me and my dad for that matter) are fucking harasses. We tell it to each other straight, and don't apologize for retaliating. You asked for it. Man to man, apologize for your fuck up, and make it right. If they fucked up, expect the same or give them a good one to the face. Personally, I see nothing wrong with that. I have had my fair share of bloody noses that I completely deserved. Keep the good ones around long enough and they will pay off to when they can have your back.

Apologize to your mom when you hurt her. Trust me, NO ONE has your back like your mom (unless she is a piece of shit). Remember, she doesn't want to let you go and will comb through every pile of biological trash you take to bed for anything that isn't ""worthy of you"". This may seem weak, but its not. Even if you are in the wrong, apologizing to mom is never a problem. Besides its usually between you and her anyway. 

Don't apologize to your dad. Now this may seem counter intuitive, but in my experience works well. You are trying to live your own life, and he want's you to live it his way. Especially when you are under one roof. He knows this. Don't think he doesn't unless he is an utter tool. If your dad has any character at all, don't apologize. You fuck up? Fix it, but don't say ""I'm sorry"" like a little pup. Take the punches as they come, and sometimes, it is okay to fight back when you know your ol'man crossed the line. Sure, respect is due where it is due. You live under his roof? Its his place, I don't think I have to explain this one. Don't like his rules, move out. Sure there are times when a quick apology is fine, but when you fucked up, fix it with actions, show him you are a man who can take shit to the face and still turn things around. I wish I wasn't such a pussy growing up and realized that my dad didn't want an apology, he wanted me to go and make something of myself.

Don't apologize to your plates. You do what you want to do, if they demand an apology as an ultimatum? Let that psycho go, unless you want the headache. What are they, your wife?

Your girlfriend if she shit tests you and you fail. Sure, if you want to keep the relationship going, you might have to get on all four's and apologize, but honestly, I am over it. I only enter commitments with concrete guidelines. If you know what you bring to the table and its more than her, she owes you an apology for putting up with her shit.

In marriage, this is up to you. This is something I have not done, and don't have the experience. I am sure the married ones will chime in in the comments. Personally, its what ever you have to do to not get divorce raped I figure.

Death, divorce, sympathy, etc. This is for those situations when you say ""I am sorry"" as a way to to feel sorry for someone. Fucking don't. Save it. If someone died here is a sentence you can copy ""...I really do sympathize with your loss, and I pray you stay strong through these tribulations"". Jesus how corporate of me.

**Second,** how to apologize without being a fucking pussy.

Stop saying my bad unless you're just shooting the shit with your friends. When you apologize to someone, make it clear as to what you are apologizing for, be specific. Don't be general. ""I apologize of taking my anger out on you mom"". ""I am sorry for using a harsh tone to explain why your financial status is sub par and getting worse"". You get it. I can't stand a man who can't tell me what he is apologizing for, like he want's me to fuck off by saying a general ""sorry"". Stop apologizing for every little thing like ""oh sorry I didn't know"". I get this all the time when I have to fill in the gaps of a situation and someone realizes they were in the wrong. If it isn't gonna change anything, just don't say it. Honestly you can use that principle in everything you say and do. If you get caught off guard just say ""Oh okay, I understand/You are right"". Instead of lowering yourself by saying I am sorry, lift up the other person by saying they were right. You can use I am sorry/you are right in combination but in certain situations. 

How do you apologize to a plate? Well we all know its a fucking game so use the most extravagant way possible. This is the exact opposite. Lets say you flaked on a date you set up. Do something different, and again, actions speak louder than words. If she texts you ""where are you"" after you bailed, just say your investment fund's office caught on fire or what ever bullshit you are feeding her anyway. Don't say I am sorry, say ""I will make it up to you"" after you are done telling your story.

There are many ways you can go about ""seeming"" like you apologized, but without actually doing so. Now you may thing, ""Why the fuck do I need to do this if in the end the other person will still take it as an apology?"" First; Plausible deniability. If anything, you didn't apologize, you were specific about your intent. Second, when other people are around, you look like less of a pussy and seem more confident in how you are going to fix it rather than how you are going to mope around after fucking up. Third: Builds YOUR character. This is for YOU. Not just for others. The less you say sorry, the more you will think differently. Your back up plan will stop being ""I'm sorry"". ""I'm sorry"" isn't a get out of jail free card. Its not a back up plan when shit goes wrong, you should have thought about that before hand. And if you didn't have a back up plan other than ""I'm sorry"", then you really aren't sorry are you? You knew what the fuck you were doing, so stop playing it off like you didn't and start coming up with solutions.

**Finally,** I would like to reiterate; this is not 100% universal and does not work 100% everywhere. This is just something to keep in mind and work on for young men who are new. This is for you to think and analyze your daily encounters with people and notice how you are being perceived by a two words.

Also I apologize for a potential run on's and incongruent paragraphing. Honestly wanted to keep it short but fucking hell you could write books on this stuff.

TL;DR - Stop looking acting like a pussy. I am sorry is not a plan B and if it is, you aren't sorry.",14,1
On Censorship and Some News on our New Platforms,"As you've likely seen in the news, censorship on the internet is in full force and effect right now. It's happening far faster and worse than [I predicted just a few months ago](https://www.trp.red/p/trp/1364). Currently it appears to be happening along USA party lines but don't be fooled about feeling safe.

The Trump era and the populist movement that occurred in the past 4-5 years is most likely the only thing that got the targets off the back of men and masculine issues.

You see, once upon a time, TRP was the boogeyman of reddit. We were the big bad guys looking to free men and exchange ideas without oversight. And that was really fucking scary to the powers that be. But with the rise of the donald subreddit, we were temporarily shielded by something even more dangerous to the powerful. 

Well, as it appears the *entire system* has now activated to rid the nation of Trump and co, there's only one place the system can focus its sights back onto. And that is, once again, **men**. It should scare you how coordinated the efforts were. Left, Right, Center, all politicians came together to damage actual conservatives. Domain Registrars, hosting platforms, social media- youtube, twitter, facebook, **discord**, etc, google play, apple app store, they all colluded to remove an element from the internet they do not like.

And now that we no longer have this shield, I believe it is a matter of time before the fight comes back to our doorstep.


During the shitstorm, the biggest competitor to reddit also shut its doors (voat). This is something I was aware might happen- but it's also the reason why I was (and still am) ardently against our subreddit simply trading one boss for another platform. We are not safe unless we take matters into our own hands.

If you've been here for any length of time, then you know we've been hard at work on our trp.red and forums.red platforms. Part of the difficulty for us was negotiating with vendors ahead of time to find pro-free-speech vendors and locking in deals that should prevent the same shuttering that's affecting so many other platforms right now. It's not the cheapest hosting, but it is (imo) the safest at the moment.

A lot of what I've been doing has been out of pocket. The entire development of the platform, scaling the services to handle tens of millions of monthly hits, and keeping it maintained has been an expensive but necessary project for me.

To keep men communicating is my passion. I do not do this for thanks or cash. I do this for one reason: because having a safe place for men to communicate is the most important value I have and without it I believe the world loses something great. 

Our [Patreon](http://a.trp.red/patreon) and Bitcoin donations: [1Hyyva2G5aCJwNqYToGoCCGATVNMB81zk7](http://a.trp.red/files/qrbtc.gif) have greatly helped in our monthly costs, and for that I am very appreciative. Currently we are not covering the monthly costs but it does take a chip out which helps me.

I am not writing this to beg for donations, but instead **I have decided to announce my next initiative.** 

Due to the rest of the internet going woke it is my opinion that we are not safe as long as we rely on any woke company for our communication.

The Fraternity's discord server has already been banned once, they are on borrowed time. Joe's youtube channel is behind enemy lines, and they've just committed to banning hundreds of thousands of videos and thousands of channels. Regardless of your view on politics, it is now a known truth that if you listen to a podcast on youtube, the members and videos that remain only do so through a form of self-censorship for an ever-changing rulebook.

This ever encroaching censorship on all platforms is unsustainable. We either continue letting big tech shut us down at every turn, or we act proactively.

# I propose an initiative to move podcasting and video directly under trp.red's umbrella to protect the speech of men, and to protect the history of speech for all to see in the event that youtube goes dark for our movement.

This isn't to say that we shouldn't still use these platforms for outreach. New ideas can reach new people outside our walled garden. But relying on these platforms is foolhardy knowing what we know now.

As a proof of concept, I have already invested some time in spinning up a peertube instance as a basis for a video platform ( https://video.trp.red/ ). It's not open to registration yet, and there is only one test video, but it gives you an idea of what we can work with. My intention is to integrate user accounts with trp.

My first goal is to backlog the entire TRP official youtube channel onto our platform: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmkSUIOMkwiLiQEhzcZS4wg

Afterwards, we will start accepting applications for uploaders. This platform will be tightly regulated to prevent liability issues / copyright issues. However, anybody with a red pill adjacent idea should have no trouble securing an upload account.

However, these goals will cost real money. This backlog is large and the undertaking will not be free. 

I think it's an immeasurable good for the community, but I will not be able to do this one alone. 

If this is something you think would bring value to our community, please consider voicing your support here and consider donating to our cause:

Do you believe that TRP is only about relationships?,[removed],0,1
Hypergamy: a graphical introduction to the concept.,"Let's take a look at this two models and see witch one makes more sense: 

Model 1 (the big triangle): on top of it, we would have our super alphas, packed with all the desirable traits, (good looking, super smart, 8 ft tall millionaires), the platonic male ( the ideal man), the one answer you get when you get when you ask women (btw that's your fault if you ask).

 If this hypothesis is true, the selection process would look like this: 

she would take all your traits ( e.g. your credit score, that Judo medal you won when you were 8)

she would give each trait a certain relative weight,

she would calculate a score comparing you with all the human males he has notion off, real or not (that means you would be competing against batman) 

she compares it to her own self perceived score ( she's a 12, of course) 

she fucks you or not (probably not, she would rather fuck that guy from the perfume add on TV) 

Model 2 ( the equilateral triangle model): each triangle represents an specific environment ( her work office, the bar she goes to on Saturday night , her yoga class) 

 If this hypothesis is true, the selection process would look like this:

She would try to identify the best catch in each space, the top of that triangle ( the coolest guy in the bar) 

she would fuck that guy 

In this model  with enough edge traits ( not that common desirable characteristics) in a specific environment, you are as fuckable as Brad Pitt.

‚ÄúHey, I don‚Äôt know you well enough yet‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to come over but I have an early morning tomorrow...‚Äù

**What should you do?**

Should you keep trying or is it time to call it quits and move on to the next girl?

# Body:

That was the exact situation I found myself in roughly 1.5 years ago after going on a couple dates with a smoking hot Asian girl I met through friends - Jen.

And I made the decision to keep pursuing.

I couldn‚Äôt help thinking that the dates we went on were all super cool!

We went to a rooftop bar with Alcoholic Popsicles! We went to a restaurant that poured dry ice on top of drinks so they erupted with smoke and covered the whole table in mist, as if you had a goblet of magic potion!

The conversations were amazing, she was such an interesting person, we could talk about philosophy, science, even business.

At the time, I was already fully RedPilled so it wasn‚Äôt like I was being a complete Beta. I was flirting, touching, teasing, doing all the right things‚Ä¶

She was flirting back. It wasn‚Äôt completely one sided. Laughing at my jokes. Even touching back.

But for some reason, whenever it was time to take things to the next level, like make out, or hang out together, IT NEVER HAPPENED.

Always one excuse after another!

I also noticed my wallet getting lighter‚Ä¶ and lighter with all the dates I‚Äôd been paying for. I mean, I didn‚Äôt mind spending more money than I usually do to fuck this girl since she was so hot.

But this was getting ridiculous!

I finally saw the writing on the wall after yet another lame ass excuse when I asked her to come over for cooking‚Ä¶

So I stopped responding to Jen and started cold approaching other girls. I wasn‚Äôt very good back then so I didn‚Äôt get sex from them either but at least it was better than wasting time on a girl that‚Äôs never going to go anywhere

Well, around when the Holidays started, Jen messaged me again‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúHey sexy, I‚Äôm feeling lonely tonight, what are you up to?‚Äù*

I‚Äôm not kidding.

Those were her exact words and I have the text messages to prove it.

**HOLY FUCK IT‚ÄôS ACTUALLY GONNA HAPPEN!**

So I drove over like a madman, picked her up, bought dinner again‚Ä¶

Only to discover that I‚Äôd been played like an idiot. Somehow, yet another excuse came up at the last minute!

‚ÄúHey, I had a lot of fun but I gotta go now. I have to tutor someone really early tomorrow. Would you mind dropping me home?‚Äù

*Brutal‚Ä¶*

At that point, I finally stopped being an idiot and told her ‚ÄúNo. Fuck you cunt‚Äù before driving off and leaving her there.

# Lessons Learned:

When first starting out, guys often focus on indicators of attraction to judge where they stand with girls.

Is she laughing at my jokes? Is she playing with her hair? Is she pointing her feet at a 30 degree angle towards me ‚Äì wait no, was it 45 degrees???

None of these are very accurate.

Instead, what you need to be looking for is compliance. Will the girl actually listen to you when you tell her to do something?

Let‚Äôs say you meet a girl for Coffee from Tinder. Will she actually follow you if you tell her, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get some air and finish our drinks outside‚Äù or will she politely decline?

That‚Äôs the only thing that actually separates: 

**A)** Girls who wanna fuck you from‚Ä¶

**B)** Girls who like hanging out with you for various other reasons ‚Äì like using you as a wallet, emotional tampon, just relieving boredom ‚Äì but from very early on, decided that you‚Äôre not a sexual option.

Women will flirt with guys they have no intention of sleeping with

Women will engage in sexual innuendo with guys they have no intention of sleeping with.

Women will even walk up and approach guys they have no intention of sleeping especially in a party setting.

But they absolutely will not follow when a guy they have no intention of sleeping with tells them to do something that would move the interaction towards sex, like going over to their place.

Therefore, it‚Äôs absolutely crucial that you tell the girl to do something as soon as possible to screen for compliance. Anything. Could be something as simple as telling her to move to another area of the coffee store.

‚ÄúActually, I don‚Äôt like the view here, let‚Äôs move next to the seat with the window instead‚Äù. 

And if she refuses even this small compliance test, then you know that she definitely won‚Äôt be down for sex later so you can pretty much stop wasting your time. Better to redirect your efforts towards other chicks that will comply.

# Next Steps:

So now that you know it‚Äôs important to screen for compliance, the next question is, **How the fuck do you screen for compliance?**

Plenty of guys make the mistake of just having a boring conversation with ZERO compliance tests after meeting a girl and asking for her phone number at the end of the conversation. This almost always leads to a ‚ÄúWell, I usually don‚Äôt give out my number‚Ä¶‚Äù or in most cases, a flakey number since most girls don‚Äôt have the balls to confront you on the spot.

I‚Äôm of the firm belief that Compliance Screening needs to happen the moment you meet the girl, and that it should continue all the way until sex. Not only does this help weed out girls who may appear interested (but really aren‚Äôt) but it even makes them slightly more attracted to you ([Ben Franklin Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_effect#:~:text=The%20Ben%20Franklin%20effect%20is,for%20this%20is%20cognitive%20dissonance.))

Now let‚Äôs look at two conversation examples of girls you meet at social gatherings.

**Example A (No Compliance Tests)**

You: ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm Karl, nice to meet you‚Äù  
Girl: ‚ÄúNice to meet you Karl!‚Äù  
You: Yeah, nice day today, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù  
Girl: ‚ÄúYeah it is!‚Äù  
(‚Äúblah blah blah, small talk, what do you do Karl, Oh I do this and that, Wow me too, blah blah blah, tease, flirt, small talk, blah blah blah‚Äù)  
You: ‚ÄúWell, I gotta run but it was cool meeting you. Let‚Äôs grab a coffee on Thursday!‚Äù  
Girl: ‚ÄúUh... I don't usually give out my number""

**Example B (With Compliance Tests)**

You: ‚ÄúExcuse me real quick, I have a question. You have a creative and artistic vibe, are you an artist?‚Äù  
Girl: ‚ÄúYes I am, how did you know!?‚Äù  
You: ‚ÄúYeah my best friend Anna growing up was an artist and you kind of remind me of her. Anyways, it‚Äôs too noisy here, let‚Äôs get away from all this foot traffic for a sec‚Äù  
Girl: ‚ÄúOh sure, okay!‚Äù  
You: ‚ÄúSo, tell me your name‚Äù   
Girl: ‚ÄúJean!‚Äù  
(‚Äúblah blah blah, small talk, what do you do Karl, Oh I do this and that, Wow me too, blah blah blah, tease, flirt, small talk, blah blah blah‚Äù)  
You: ‚ÄúWell, I gotta run but it was cool meeting you. Let‚Äôs grab a coffee on Thursday!‚Äù  
Girl: ‚ÄúOkay!‚Äù (Proceeds to give her number and actually comes out when you text her)

Notice how there‚Äôs 3 smaller compliance tests sprinkled in before the main one ‚Äì asking for her number.

**1)** Asking her if she‚Äôs an artist

**2)** Telling her to follow you somewhere away from the others for a moment

**3)** Telling her to give you her name

This makes it much more likely she will actually comply with your main compliance test later. It‚Äôs like boiling a frog (or taking away a population‚Äôs freedom). Gotta do it gradually, one step at a time, or else people will notice since it‚Äôs too abrupt.

But the key is, all of these requests have to be natural. And you‚Äôll get the hang of it the more you practice. When first starting out with these compliance tests, guys like to make these huge overblown requests like ‚ÄúHey, buy me a drink!‚Äù or ‚ÄúHey, follow me, let‚Äôs dance!‚Äù

Predictably, you'll just get blown out every single time. 

These might work if you have really high Value (tall, jacked, super good looking), but for the average guy, you‚Äôll need to stack a few smaller compliance tests before going for bigger asks.

Now what happens if you try asking for small compliance asks (like moving to another area) and find that most girls won‚Äôt even agree to that?

Well, sorry to break it to you but in that case, you simply don‚Äôt have enough Value. Period. Remember, girls show compliance to guys they're willing to fuck. And if you find that most girls won't show any compliance... then you know most girls aren't going to fuck you. Simple as that.

In fact, it's a pretty good test of how good you actually are with girls. Do most girls actually comply when you ask them to do something? It doesn't really mean anything if you can make a girl laugh or flirt back. Anybody can do that after enough cold approaches to get comfortable talking to strangers. But not everyone can get compliance when they ask for it.

The only solution is to work on yourself. Get to 12% body fat or less, work on fashion and body language. Work on tonality and eye contact. Get a trendy haircut.

Doesn‚Äôt matter how good you are with compliance testing if you lack fundamentals. 

But the good thing is you‚Äôll notice that as your body improves from months of heavy compound lifts at the gym, it‚Äôll naturally be easier and easier to get compliance from the girls you meet. Some of those crazier upfront asks that used to get you blown out every time like pulling a girl up and dragging her to the dance floor will actually work once in a while after you build up enough baseline Value.

Just make sure that you never, ever waste time with a girl that refuses to comply.

Because as they say in poker, the key to winning is:

*You gotta know when to hold ‚Äòem*

*And you gotta know when to fold ‚Äòem.*",136,1

How do i start?,"I want everyone to read and leave a comment no matter what it is. There is no other place for me to gain information.
Im 19, almost 20. And i've had a very massive crash in my life that lead to my depression and have been recovering ever since. pretty unique life experience. Definitely A LOT of people worse off than me. I've experienced what being alpha, mentally strong, honorable, decisive and simply unbreakable feels like and what It does to your relationship with women.
Now im starting from zero and i found redpill and i cannot believe my eyes...everything is so fucking true according to my experience. One of the things im grateful for is that im a decently smart person. Definitely not the smartest but im okay. My biggest weakness is that im very sensitive its a part of who i am. How do i get rid of it?  I have a built in philosopher inside of me and i like talking about my ideas. I like sharing EVERYTHING. How do i resist the urge to point out to women how they act according to this trip theory and stop this analytical process or at least keep it from being known outside of myself. I analyze things and always try to prove my theories or ideas and the fact that women being women obviously act all crazy...something all of us here agree on. Women think differently and have different values. They will never get it. Which is fine and i know the problem is me. How do i fix myself and get to where i want to be? Do i get a coach? How? Who? Plus i dont have any money to spend on that. What books do i read? Just how do i stop wanting to share and express my ideas? How do i keep my focus sharp and pointing inward? 
How do i live in this feminism bullshit Society? I absolutely hate that shit and i dont even get how someone with a sane logical mind supports it. Its absurd. How do you gentlemen deal with this? In a recent post..somebody commented saying ""i got over the redpill anger a while ago and realized you have to accept women for what they are.""... Honestly im way too angry to do that now. Its genuinely disgusting and pushes me to the point where i wish i was insensitive enough so that could treat them like expendable objects in my harem. unfortunately i always overshare.",36,1
Iam a bartender just dropping red pill for you guys about woman being alone in pubs/clubs (Part1),"Iam 26 and I have always wanted to be a bartender
Iam a really good looking guy. Iam fit, heavily tattooed, model like face features, I consider myself handsome dude and I knew woman are shallow, always knew how to game woman even when I was a little kid had that ""heart breaker vibe"" sticked to me, basicly a natural before I became fully redpilled the past 2 years.

 something about this job was always seem cool, energetic, and teach you how to be social, talkative.
listening to amazing music and good vibes everywhere
you would not belive the crazy shit Ive seen and expirienced as working for only 2 months (before covid19 hit and all pubs closed).

this is a story I would like to share from dozen

The Russian Curls story: 

It was a good shift kinda weird, music was blasting and everyone were dancing with cool neon lights and the smell of alcohol and ciggarettes in the air, that sense of euphoria from the intoxication of alcohol and some drugs
 2 woman came in through the dimmed dark crowd that was having fun dancing and shouting..

 ""Hey bartender whats your name?"" she said to my ear as I was leaning forward ""Iam M'"" I responded.
""Pour us 2 glasses of red wine hottie"" the second woman shouted as the speakers were blasting. 

So I did, now the first woman was extremely good looking she was like in her 30 but she had this amazing curly black hair and blue piercing eyes gazing onto me checking my outfit and the rest of me as I was talking to her friend who was heavily tattooed and noticed my tattooed arm and neck ""Hey! where have you got more tattos these are beautiful!"" as she grabbed my arm to look at it closer.

 I said my whole stomach is heavily tattooed also and boys...as soon I lifted my shirt up these 2 woman got fucking stunned with this dumb founded look ""What the fuck?"" one of them shouted and the curly woman shoved her friend a side too admire my art. ""I HAVE A TATTOO TOO!! but its in a private place"" So I said cool nice for her, and as soon I was turning around to other clients she says ""Wanna see?!"" so I turned around said sure.

 now the pub is fucking packed with clients all over the bar hearing our interaction and watching closly...she took her half pants down pulled up her shirt pulled up her thongs wayyy up and showed me this little twitie bird from cartoons on her inner thigh near her pussy 
*Damn this bitch had a nice body holyshit* I was thinking to myself.. 

everyone in the pub was fucking shocked LMAO 
I think I saw someone spit out his drink from his mouth all over the bar! like in the movies ROFL, So after this incident you see this wave of drunk simps and betas trying to hit on her while I mind my own shit, she then started flirting with me as soon she saw I was disinterested cleaning up the bar and talking to other girls that I knew as my clients.
 She said to me ""I fucking hate you so much can you take 15 minutes break while we go to talk....in the toilet together?"" and I said ""Nop"" she asked me why and I go ""Because I have the feeling you are married""  she goes ""Yeah..I have 2 kids and a husband waiting for me to come home tonight but we are on bad terms and I want to be a bad girl tonight"".

as soon as she said it I was fucking sad for the dude, this bitch would of break up her family and entire life just to fucking blow me.. this is fucked up beyond me. I didnt wanted to get involved in this and was just acting nice and friendly while she and her friend tried to talk me into some crazy bdsm shit (I do love the BDSM), she left me 100$ dollar tip tho,  so that was nice at least...
 
AWALT some pussy aint worth the squeeze, guys this is one story of many I had, I legit banged a chick in the toilet and later found out after I cummed on her face she had a bf of 6 years...the story is a redpill by its own if you want me to tell it with all the convo between us , say in the comments.

My OWN Sister did this.,"I have a sister of age 30. She's  divorced. The other day she was on Tinder, chatting with random men. Well she was taking to this one guy and she was having afun conversation, her facia exoression said it all.




Now she asked this guy what was his height to which he responded 5'5 and why does it matter? She sent a laughing emoji and directly ghosted him. She herself told me all this. Now I have no problwm with her rejecting him but she should at least do it with dignity. Just bcoz the guy is 5'5 you can't just ghost him can you? Before telling her about his height,he did ask her out to which she responds I'll think bout it. But after the height topic she ghosted the poor guy. Now I know that height matters but rejection can be done respectfully. 





I told her that what she did was wrong and she should have politely said no I'm not looking for any of that. She got angry on me and started screaming at me telling how all men are bastards etc. Just think about it guys,if the same thing was done by a man to woman then what? What if a man talking nicely with a woman suddenly ghosted her just coz she's slightly overweight? Society would call the man a womanizer, a dog,a bastard and what not. Girls would come up with slogans like 'All girls are beautiful in their own way' Well then are we men swines? I hate this double standard and this needs to change.

Strength In Iron,"**A Man Must Know His Purpose**

As a man we want our purpose written in stone, inscribed and shaped with iron. The purpose clearly known to us, so that there is no question as to the path that we take. There can be no question as to what to do in the moment, it is clear, it has been written in stone, shaped with iron.

**We Have A Calling Greater Than We Know**

We as men have a role in this world, a responsibility, a true calling granted to us by the strength, fortitude and will that our ancestors have blessed us with by conquering and surviving in a much harder and desperate time. Our role as men is to create, build, philosophize, and architect humanities future. We will build the technology of the future, the buildings, roads and machinery that will take us to other worlds and make ours the greatest that it can be. Like those machines men can contain great power not believed, realized or even understood by weaker men. There is only one way to get it, you cannot buy it, you cannot have it given to you, you must earn it, it is yours for the taking. With it you can know great power that will change your perspective of the world.

**Do Not Waste What Has Been Given To You**

Great men wake up before the sun rises. A great man takes the opportunity to shape his body to his vision of greatness while the rest of the competition is still sleeping. While others are at their most susceptible state, a great man is moving iron, he is sweating profusely hammering on his craft, creating the sculpture that is man. There can be no time wasted, those precious seconds decide. Decide whether your ancestors' genes were wasted on you, whether in that moment, in that second you have improved your stake or continued to degrade and waste; there is only one choice. That greatness is in your soul, if you let it lead you towards your purpose your purpose will be realized and all of the greatest potential that has been bred into you over millions of years will get it's moment in the sun and your ancestors will be smiling down on you knowing that those great struggles and sacrifices they took on have allowed them to live on in you.",25,1

"""You are gaslighting me. My views are too extreme for feminism.""","Tl;DR; Woman openly admits to wanting to oppress men, views too extreme for feminism, machievellian master of frame control. Is blatantly open female supremacy a thing now?

I got into an argument with a woman on Whisper (I have been getting into arguments on Whisper to gain insight into human behavior, 10/10 would recommend for writers and anyone else who wants to get up close and personal with people anonymously for any reason) and she accused me of gaslighting her for calling her a feminist (lol) and she said that her views were too extreme for feminism. She said, and I quote ""You won't find a single non-MGTOW source that equates my views with feminism."" She then took this and ran with it to continue to paint the picture she intended to paint. She seemed to betray that she hates all men and did not contend when I accused her of not wanting equality but wanting to raise women above men. Has female supremacy actually openly separated itself from feminism yet, or is this woman too stupid to realize that everybody that shares her views hides behind the mask of feminism and equality in order to gain support? This womanly unabashedly spewed her vitriol for men and her views while simultaneously constantly trying to frame me as abusive, gaslighting me, and trying to referee the conversation, meanwhile doing all of these things herself and projecting them onto me. It's really crazy ultra machievelli shit. She didn't seem to have any sort of self awareness, I was arguing with a total machievellian automaton that believed its own bullshit. The way that she effortlessly warped reality to fit her own narrative no matter what was said to her actually has me as close to afraid as I'm capable of being anymore. That level of frame control is a real life superpower. I've never seen such a giant hamster. I feel like I just saw Moth Man or Big Foot. This shit is unreal.",44,1

Dark Days Are Ahead,"Good evening brothers.  I used to post here some years ago under a different name - not that it really matters except I felt like this is the one place that I could post some thoughts about what has happened recently and what is going to happen.

First of all, the deep state is real - and by deep state I mean 95-97% of everyone in Washington.

Many former Trump supporters who are allegedly serious thinkers have turned on him as of late - and those that are doing that are just virtue signaling, trying to show that they favor restraint and dialogue over the effect of in your face political pressure.  Its just worthless ignorant noise.   Do you for one second think that these deep state psychopaths (because that's what they are) give any kind of fuck about you being polite and civilized?  They're laughing at your need to be accepted as a ""mature"", ""intelligent"" and ""thoughtful"" while they have infrastructure that listens in on your smartphone while you fuck your wife.  

FFS, they murdered Seth Rich in the street - and he's just one of countless whistleblowers that have killed that threatened their schemes.  If you get any kind of close to exposing their criminality - THEY WILL KILL YOU - and their buddies in federal law enforcement and the press will cover it up for them.  They stole the damn election, blocked any evidence from seeing the light of day in court - and then turned around and shamed the people who tried to hold them to account.  They are sick, evil, ruthless, diabolical liars.  There is no negotiating with these people.  There are no appeals to morality with enlightened discourse.  The people who run Washington DC are monsters beyond reach.

Say what you want about Trump, but his greatest gift to us was showing us who they are and how deep the rabbit hole goes. It wasn't so much about what he said and did, but how they reacted to him when he proved uncontrollable.   It was unintended accelerationism.  Even Mike Pence, who we all lauded as Brace Bannon with lightning memes and shit turned out to be an evil snake lusting after greed and power.  Christian my ass.  McConnell, Graham, Mitt, and all those guys are total filth - just the absolute worst.  We all know what kind of insane evil batshittery exists on the left - GOPe aren't any damn better.  The choice is - you want the knife in the front or in the back?  Either way we're stuck.

Now they want to wipe out everyone who has ever financially or vocally supported Trump.  They are going to try to bring Chinese style authoritarianism to America because global oligarchs' dicks can't get hard enough when they think about the amount of control Chairman Xi has.  They believe they have the pieces in place make it happen everywhere - because China was their test case - and a successful one at that.  They control whether or not you make money and what public voice they choose you to have - and if you talk shit you'll disappear like Jack Ma.  Global fascism is accelerating right now.

Most of us just want to be able to work our hustle, run a business or work a decent job, carve a little something out for ourselves - get laid and buy a few luxury toys.  Fuck man, that is the American dream.  Its all we really want.  It the eyes of the ""elites"" us ham and egger types have way too much - and they hate us for it - a deep loathing.  They don't want us to have shit, thinking we are undeserving and will relentlessly fight us to take it away.  

Also, nothing is more funny to me that seeing the TRP/Manosphere types talk about how alpha they are as if they will survive the ""great decline"" unscathed while the rest burn.  Granted you might not be as fucked as the SJW loser who lives in a trailer parked on the drive up approach property of Evil Inc in Silly Valley, but brohims you are just as screwed as the rest of us.  Even worse if your hustle is online grifting using social media. LOL kiss that shit goodbye.  Fucked up part is half these alleged alphas will sell out so fast for a damn pittance it will make your head spin - and then they'll pat themselves on the back for their alleged ingenuity in the process while they help cuck narratives with backhanded spin. 

My advice?  Get a fucking real job.  Find a niche business you can crank before they shitfuck us all with lockdowns and tax us into poverty - and lay low.  Maybe do what u/GayLubeOil suggests and search out somewhere where you can fuck the shit out of some local village girl daily while sipping on some vino.  Shit is going to get way worse before it gets any better.  

I read online there are three things people do when the hammer of fascism starts to drop: submit, fight or flee.  We Americans are a brazen bunch, so mark my words before this shitfest flushes totally down, bullets are going to fly.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating for shooting people - just making an educated guess here.  As it stands now the cat is totally out of the bag - everyone in DC is a straight up criminal who will write themselves and their buddies trillions of dollars in checks, but lock your ass down and tell you your attempts at survival is killing grandma.  If you try to stop them - or even reign them in a little - expect them to bring a violent reprisal against you with BLM/ANTIFA mobs that burn your home or business to ash while the cops look the other way.  The pretense is gone.  If you believe or hope these psychos are going to slow down because no Trump, well you're fucking fooling yourself.  Trump was our last firewall - and in blowing him the fuck out to get rid of him, they dropped trousers and showed everyone their dicks.  Delusional fuckheads think lying about it is going to work this time.  Nope.  Gone to the well too many times on that chief - and since there are no more secrets - when it dawns on them the lies aren't working anymore, there is going to be a mad scramble to see how much they can take before they get checked.  So strap in for that.

These fuctard elites are INSANE so don't expect any restraint whatsoever.  They printed so much damn money into their own pockets luxury lifestyle costs are hockey sticking with inflation on them.  Normal chucklefucks like you and I don't notice as much, but buying a boat or a plane has tripled.  Just about any kind of high dollar luxury bauble has increased in price by hundreds of percentage points.   So what did Congress do in response?  Gave themselves $1.4T and told us here's $600 go fuck yourselves.  Meanwhile global production is down by as much as 20%.  Printing money without doing any actual investment into production equals scary bad inflation - especially with $30T deficits.  The world is being governed right now by insatiably greedy totalitarian retards driving the global economy over a cliff - ready to ruin or murder anyone who tries to stop them.  When the whole thing comes down on everyone's heads...  Well...  I seriously don't know WTF is going to happen, but it sure af isn't going to be good.  I DGAF what Maynard Keenan says - Everything sure as hell isn't going to be alright.

Buys as many guns and ammo as you can, stock up on the necessities.  Pray for hope, but expect the worst out of this new crazy marxist intersectional feminist regime about to take over.  They are going to fuck us over in a way no other US gov has - and what's left of the obliterated GOP is going to root them on.  Welcome to our dystopian future.",39,1

Remember that Reddit is social media,"I used to tell myself proudly, I did not waste time on social media, only to later realize the irony of my blind paradigm. Reddit IS social media, it may not look like conventional social media, but it is in fact social media. 

Social media is terrible because it is addicting and a coping mechanism. Since most users are lurkers; they get that dopamine high from merely sitting by doing nothing. This only lulls you into being lazy and reactive, instead of taking charge of your life and fulfilling your potential. Please reconsider your Reddit habits, I have personally wasted thousands, if not more, hours on being a filthy lurker. Next thing you know you'll be a cuck because you weren't being proactive in managing your women and life. 

One tool I use to manage internet distractions is a FireFox extension, Intention. It sets time limits on your surfing and like it's name suggests: forces you to be intentional in your actions. That's where accountability and responsibility tie in. That's when you realize you need to take control. Not let the social media algo's do that for you. 

I have written in a journal for a week now and it has really made coherency of my life. Time I would have wasted here. Be Intentional in your time, boys. You might think your time is not worth much but that's False. You can really be something you want, if you put intention and work into Your time.",20,1

Stop Talking So Goddamn Much (You Don‚Äôt Have To),"I accepted the Red Pill early on. I was 17 actually. 

However, for a good amount of my life, I was awkward, weak bodied, weak minded, and struggled to talk to people. And even after I joined the military and gained 20 lbs, I still had lingering issues with interacting. I wasn‚Äôt good at reading social cues, or asking the right questions, or building verbal rapport with people. When I did finally begin learning how to do those things, my way of interacting, although it worked, was still just a bit too sterile, too formal. You see, my issue lay in the fact that if I didn‚Äôt know someone very well, things like charm and wit just wouldn‚Äôt show. If I tried faking them, it would only make things worse. 

So when I heard that there were all kinds of ways that ‚Äúconversation‚Äù could lead to sex, I didn‚Äôt really  like it. I didn‚Äôt like the idea of doing the one thing I didn‚Äôt like, talking, to get the girl. But I tried nevertheless. I tried ‚Äúspicing things up‚Äù and ‚Äúintroducing a little danger‚Äù into my interactions with women, but I was stiff and ill at ease, and even though it worked more often than it didn‚Äôt, I felt like a an actor putting on an act. It took a lot of work to talk a girl into bed. 

I went through a pretty long dry spell. Nine months of training in the military, and very strict rules about ‚Äúfraternization.‚Äù You know, the usual shit. And I proceeded to fall out of practice when it came to ‚Äúrunning game,‚Äù or at least that‚Äôs what I thought. I felt that I was generally out of touch with a side of me that could ‚Äúcharm a room.‚Äù But this was just the first step to completely purging myself of PUA bullshit. 

After training, I met a girl. And I was verging on MGTOW by this time, so I wasn‚Äôt looking, but she‚Äôd caught my attention. She was petite, but fit, brunette, piercing grey blue eyes. High energy, upbeat. I liked her ‚Äúvibe‚Äù as people say. I didn‚Äôt really realize it at the moment, but even though we hardly even talked, (and when we did it was pretty much about nothing,) she was becoming increasingly more comfortable with increasingly more physical contact. See, I‚Äôd decided to not try to say much, and maybe even be a little aloof, but at the same time, I wasn‚Äôt trying to suppress my attraction for her. When we finally hung out one on one, it was she who‚Äôd invited me. Took me off guard for a moment, until I realized I‚Äôd been withholding just enough for her to want more.

When our day together started drawing to a close, I decisively ended my dry spell. And honestly, it seemed like a fluke at first. I thought, ‚ÄòI hardly said anything.‚Äô And that was true. We talked very little, and when we were talking, we were talking about stupid shit that had nothing to do with anything, the delivery guy‚Äôs weird mustache, the floor tiles, the fucking weather, but there was heavy eye contact, tons of kino, and an unspoken but very noticeable tension that had been building up since we‚Äôd first met. And that‚Äôs when it hit me. 

My physical actions, the way I behaved, regardless of what words came out of my mouth, were completely congruent with my attraction to this girl. And that was the most important game discovery that I‚Äôve made to date. I might have said, ‚ÄúI think the temperature dropped a little,‚Äù but what I felt was, ‚ÄúI want to fuck you and I‚Äôm okay with that.‚Äù Probably for the first time, I let that masculine energy just sort of bleed out of me, and it proved effective in an almost unintentional way. 

Since then, I‚Äôve been operating this very same way with girls that catch my eye. I‚Äôm not a talker, I‚Äôm not some improv guy, or standup comedian. I‚Äôm too stoic, and a little too quiet and traditional to be the dancing monkey. And that‚Äôs just fine. I‚Äôve cultivated this strategy, shaped it, built on it. These days I tend to be a kind of ‚Äúinsider‚Äù so to speak. What I mean by that, is that in situations where guys are clamoring for a girl‚Äôs attention, telling jokes and being loud and entertaining, I‚Äôm the one already taking her hand, dancing with her, kissing her. And while she laughs at and humors the guys entertaining her, they wonder why they‚Äôre still so far away and I‚Äôm so close. It‚Äôs because they were too busy trying to talk her into bed to act. The more frequent your small escalations, the more comfortable she will be with the large ones. So start small but start early. 

I‚Äôm writing this mostly to say that if you‚Äôre like me, and I guarantee a lot of you are, you don‚Äôt have to change. Find your mode of operation. There‚Äôs not one right way to do things, only one foundational principle that women will remain be governed by the evolutionary tendencies coded into their DNA to aid in their survival in pre-industrial world. There are more ways to be attractive than to be a social butterfly. That‚Äôs only one of many archetypes available to channel. 

This also goes to prove that there‚Äôs always more to learn. I could‚Äôve sworn that, in my mid twenties, I was so much more experienced than I was at 17. But I still had more room to grow. A lot more. I‚Äôve discovered my own avatar, one that suits me, not someone I have to give myself a headache trying to be.

Get Ready For Happenings To Start Happening,"At the beginning of 2020, two months ahead of lockdown. I wrote an article predicting the pandemic and its effects on the sexual marketplace. Immediately the NoFap Alfa Stoics of Autism came out in force complaining that my revelations were irrelevant and that we should instead regurgitate 2015 Red Pill Ad Infinitum. According to them the pandemic had nothing to do with the Red Pill or the sexual marketplace. 

They were too short-sighted to see the implications of national lockdowns with mask mandates would have on the dating market. 17th century Puritan New England had a better dating scene than what we had in 2020. In all respects 2020 was an absolute disaster for the dating market and 2021 is going to be a lot worse.

"(quick question) why is this sub ""quarantined"", and what is it?",[removed],0,1
The MOST IMPORTANT insight about hypergamy that I ever had,"Disclaimer: Everything in this topic is just my opinion

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*Hypergamy\* is the need that a woman feels to always align with men superior than herself. And this is all you need to know about women and attraction.  


&amp;#x200B;

Proof:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Why women feels attraction towards guys that ignores her? Because it imply that the man is superior to her.  


  
Why women hate to be complimented? It implies that the man is inferior. (she only likes to be complimented if it is a push pull.. a complimented followed by disqualification, because in this case, it wouldn't show that you are inferior).  


  


\*Things that shows that you are superior to them\*: ignoring her, negs, being richer than her, being smarter then they are, being prettier, taller, more famous  


  
\*Things that shows that you are INFERIOR to them:\*: loving her, attatchment, complimenting her, being more poor than her, dumber, uglier, smaller, less famous, emotional, reactive, sensitive

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That's it guys, all the other theories comes from hypergamy. They can't feel anything other than repulse to inferior guys. Notice that inferior and superior does not truly exists.. It exists only in her mind.  


&amp;#x200B;

If you are trying to win back an ex girlfriend, never express your feelings, because you will show that you are inferior, hence you will become invisible to then. They will fight you and feel repulse, or completely ignore you.  


If you want to win over a girl from instagram, never double comment of her status. If anything, comment making fun of her. If you comment and try to build confort, you are actually  destroying attraction because you are displaying that you are inferior.  


  
Once I truly loved a girl. I said this to her several times. The more I said, the less she thought about me, to the point she actually said she couldn't care less if I was dead or alive. I cannot blame her, because it's the nature of women. The more she thinks  that there is indeed she is superior, the more repulse she will feel. This was so confusing to me at the time. I just wanted to live normally and express my feelings, but now I know that it's impossible because of this mechanism from nature. This is truly sad, because a person that were basically your best friend and soul mate, now doesn't even recognize you as a human being, because the thinks she is superior. It is insane to me, but it's the hidden truth. Hypergamy is real.",70,1

What should be common knowledge (when diving into a ltr/engagement/marriage),"This information has most probably been provided over and over and over, yet there are still so many who continue to make this mistake and I feel it is just to once more put a reminder out there.

&amp;#x200B;

Exhibit A: My friend has just gotten engaged. My friend is actually subscribed to The Red Pill and all its glory. My friend has still made these fatal mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Any young ones out there, contemplating getting into a LTR, Engagement and/or Marriage, learn from this (and what others will surely post/correct).**

&amp;#x200B;

**DO NOT** \- get into a LTR/Engagement/Marriage until you have vetted her family, especially her mother and plausible soy boy father. My friend did no such thing with the vetting, prior to popping the question. We have just met the mother and she is a harpie land whale. Loud, obnoxious, feels the world is owed to them and allowed to run a rampant on her husband who is taking abuse like it's nothing. (Happy wife, happy life - AMIRIGHT). You should of heard the screech on this woman when said husband took far too long in getting the phone camera ready to take a group photo.

&amp;#x200B;

**Case in point** \- Friend and I were out and about, arrived back at his place, fianc√© is on the couch and watching one of her many reality tv shows (because they're all about reality AMIRIGHT). First thing she does, no greeting, no love or affection, but scream to him ""WHERE ARE MY DONUTS!""

Turns out friend, missed a text from her where she asked him to pickup donuts. After flipping her lid, she ordered him to go out and get the donuts for her. He obliged like a good boy.

Why his fianc√© views this as acceptable behavior... Why she has lived in that environment her entire life with her mother doing the exact same thing to her father.

&amp;#x200B;

Vet, VeT, VET!

&amp;#x200B;

**DO NOT** \- get into a LTR/Engagement/Marriage unless your partner has MONEY! I am talking about proper, PROPER money. Weather it is all from Daddy, or she has earned it herself, make sure she has FUCKING MONEY! (Now I read people and LOL when they say that the man should always have more money as it means they have more power and will be respected further and etc. You might be right... On the other hand, I'm more than fine in receiving my $500 Hugo Boss leather satchel as a JUST BECAUSE gift, or turning away a Rolex (I still have too much Mr. Nice Guy in me) as I couldn't accept it as this chick and I were in no way going to be serious (like she believed it was) - anyhow).

&amp;#x200B;

Why I say, make sure she has money... Well it save you from having to break your back in working two jobs just to support this unicorn princess of yours. Furthermore, picture doing all that, buying a house, sacrificing your hours/life/sanity for your unicorn princess to just divorce you and take it all away :)

&amp;#x200B;

Make sure she is rich kiddies... Helps save you from divorce rape. Helps save you from having to financially handle it all. Helps save you from having to buy shit for her as she can buy it herself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Case in point -** Friend is on a nice $60k salary. His fianc√© is on $35k (or thereabout.)  She expected a Tiffany diamond engagement ring (lol) - Thank fuck friend did not provide that, however, he has promised her one for the future...

This is your future, friend, busting your ass in overtime and the likes, just to drop the $15k (or whatever it is) down the toilet!

&amp;#x200B;

**DO NOT -** get into a LTR/Engagement/Marriage unless you're planning on having kids. I am a firm believe that a child should be raised by a mother and father unit.

So kiddies, make sure your woman can ACTUALLY FUCKING HAVE KIDS (another form of vetting). Imagine locking her down and finding out it's a baron wasteland...

You need to also make sure that she wants kids. And when you have the conversations, you can actually see through the potential fake statement she is just spewing in order to lock you down.

**Case in point -** (Another friend of mine, has a home with his 6 year long GF... She has now come out saying she actually never wants to have kids... Poor dude is too invested now and too much of a bitch to cut ties!)

&amp;#x200B;

**DO NOT -** get into a Engagement/Marriage until you have lived together for a minimal of one year. (Now this is something I do not understand. A lot of people say that you should never live together until you're married... This is very big mistake. Living together, she will most probably be putting on a farce for the first 3-6 months. Her true colors will then come out (leaving laundry everywhere, staining everything with her makeup, hair all over the place (clogging drains), being clung to you 24/7! Et. Cetera and Et. Cetera...) - Now imagine you're already married and all this shit comes to fruition and you can't handle/stand it... And you're saying you should be married first before living together? Tskkkkkk)

&amp;#x200B;

Be sure you've lived together for a minimal of one year. You'll be around each other practically 24/7... You'll garner if you can stand the witch and if what she does is acceptable and if you're able to ensure her behavior is appeasing you!

&amp;#x200B;

**DO NOT -** get into a LTR/Engagement/Marriage unless you can actually stand the bitch. Her looks, will fade. Her pussy, will not feel as good as a 19 year old.  Her body, even surgically enhanced, will not compete with a 19 year old. Her sense of humor that you found adorable, will get on your fucking nerves! Et. Cetera and Et. Cetera

So... Be sure this partner of yours is a legit 'best friend' candidate. You have fun. It's like your first dates together. Going to the movies, fun. Going to the bar for some drinks, fun. Going on a 3 week cruise together, fun. Et. Cetera and Et. Cetera.

**Case in point -** My friend is already hating when they go on holiday together, He wants to do one thing, she the other... Enjoy the lifetime of this, my friend :)

&amp;#x200B;

**DO NOT -** get into a LTR/Engagement/Marriage until you have taken her out to get drunk (at a club/bar/what not) and she has also had a proper girls night out (when you ain't there - but your bro is as a sleeper...).

&amp;#x200B;

When you're with her and you got her plastered... Was she perhaps chatting to a Chad/Tyrone right in front of you? Perhaps ignoring you and touching his chest, giggling at the most mundane comments? Et. Cetera and Et. Cetera.

&amp;#x200B;

Proper girls night out... Was this tour 14 of her world famous BJ tours?Imagine sitting at home on a SAT night (with kids, or just because) while she is out with her skank friends and blowing Chad/Tyrone in the bathroom (something that she'd never do with you as SHE DOESN'T DO THAT/NOT THAT KINDA GIRL).

&amp;#x200B;

**Case in point -** My friends fianc√©, is already talking about how she will be flying to Miami or Vegas for her bachelorette party...

&amp;#x200B;

**Do not -** Develop a dad body because its what she wants and is sexy (LOL)Seriously... How do these fucktards believe that being a fat tub of lard is sexy =\\

(All I know is when we are in a hot tub, no one is looking at your dad bod - they're looking at my A1 physique and attempting footsies under the bubbles. Don't even get me started when I'm cleaning the house in nothing but my underwear ;D)

**Do not -** Give up on your goals and your hobbies.You're an idiot if you stop being who you were, just because you're now LTR/Engaged/Married.

Sat night was UFC night with the boys... Then keep fucking doing it!6-10pm on Mon-Fri is gym, studies, music, Et. Cetera... Then keep fucking doing it!You have a motorbike and she wants you to get rid of it... Buy another one!You made plans to go out and she says, why didn't you ask me for permission... Leave the house the day before and stay out a day later ;)You get the point, right?

&amp;#x200B;

**Do not -** Overlook RED FLAGS!It can be easy to overlook red flags due to your feels... This is what these illustrious forums are about. Ask a proper RED FLAG question, you'll get proper answers...(NO! Asking my ltr is talking with her ex and wants to hang out with him, do I allow this? - IS NOT A PROPER FUCKING QUESTION!)

&amp;#x200B;

**Do not -** Give up on dread/being a suave MOFO.When your girl can see that everyone is dying to fuck you (especially if she has sisters and/or her bffs are making it so obvious with the steam being produced from their vag! - you're doing great)

&amp;#x200B;

**Do not -** Fall for shit tests and/or argue...Why would you argue with a woman?Seriously, why!?She is only arguing with you because she is bored, or that's what she sees as the norm on reality TV... Let her vent (if you have to) as that is all she wants... To vent... To get it alllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll out. Or better yet, dial her best friend, hand the phone to her and say enjoy!

**Do not** \- Forget that AWALT.I know a chick that is a Dr.  (A Dr. Of Veterinary Medicine to be more specific)A Dr. Should be a better class of chick, right?

!AWALT!

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to continue, but I have other shit to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure others will be chiming in, with further input and/or even calling me an A1 retard with some of the things I mentioned.

"Values conflicted, feeling lost","I don't know how to square how I was raised to be a man and how I've learned to be one successfully. I'll admit, I've been a long time lurker after my wedding fell apart and I went looking for answers in places I didn't want to look. I had always been put off by these kinds of circles, being fairly liberal. I was a little wary of being contaminated with the ideology. 

I think I'm only really coming into an appreciation now in life (33) of my sexual value and my value as a partner. I guess I'm what you'd call a Chad, always been pretty successful when it comes to sleeping with women, even when I was a loser. The harder I've worked at on being a good man, the less successful it seems I am with women. But I'm also aware that a lot of my motivation to be a good man comes from fear of the imagined potential to be a monster. 

I get a lot of female attention as a man. And I don't know what to do with it. I know what I could do with it, and that's fuck a lot of beautiful, young women. And while everything in my biology is telling me that is what I should do, my Christian upbringing is choking my throttle like a governor. And I know that repressing any healthy drive only pathologizes it. I was pretty good at being an asshole lecher, but I just don't know if my libido is something that I can honor consciously and ethically.

[Question] How would you define a Low Value Female,"I tried to post this on MGTOW2 but it got removed (I'm banned from MGTOW)

Considering how FDS likes to define what a LVM is such as being a 'gamer' and my experience of women because I'm in the autism spectrum (they don't want men who are), I thought I'll post this here.

As somebody with autism, those on FDS thinks I'm a LVM

Those I can thin of what a low value female

1. Gossip and backstab anyone - even people close to them like friends, family, etc
2. Watches too much junk on TV
   1. Conversations revolve on TV shows (all current TV shows are made for women)
3. Spends too much time on her phone
4. Influenced by the above (ie reality TV lifestyle, celeb culture)
5. has no other hobbies other than that
6. Sets dating preference on the man's bank account, which is what all women do
7. Complain rather than do something about it
8. Have no apprecation to what her man do or his hobbies
9. Its all about her

One posted by a user on MGTOW2

1. is a depreciating asset at best and a growing liability at worst;
2. has a sense of entitlement;
3. is incapable of contributing anything substantive to the relationship;
4. lowers your worth and self-worth;
5. is a negative influence;
6. doesn't appreciate/value you.

"as an attention-giver, I'm part of the problem","I've seen pages of people complaining about how the modern young woman gets far too much attention and gets favors and niceness from many men, which in turn, raises her expectations and causes her to seek Mr. Perfect, since Mr. Nice and Mr. Useful are plentifully available.  I always thought of this from the perspective of the dudes, who get an unfair shake; they all have to compete for the tiny, tiny portion of women who are both attractive and have reasonable expectations. 

Looking at it from the other side though, I'm part of the problem. By being a ""beta-enabler"" (not that I'm particularly fond of labels), I'm doing my part to create the environment that sees women obtain undeserved attention or services for free. These infinitesimally small actions add up and create the woman that dismisses reasonable men in favor of perceived 9s and 10s  and fucks up the dating pool. Constantly getting so much attention is the inverse of the incel problem and likely creates women who will never be satisfied in life , or other mental health problems. Some people become unable to recognize efforts and services performed by others. This also applies to rich people who become accustomed to difficult labor being a fingersnap away, and then become unable to appreciate the efforts and diligent work of anyone. This is bad mental health distortion that affects both service providers and service-receivers. 

here's my advice for today. The contradiction here is that as man (and as a person) you should  be of service to others, without expecting anything in return, to maximize your usefulness and thus your happiness. Weather it's labor or attention,  your compulsion to help others is positive and you should do all sorts of stuff for others (especially  in your quest to do deep work and develop competence and mastery) --  money and opportunity will find it's way back to you like this. Especially compared to doing the opposite ; sitting on the couch not doing anything for anyone just to prove you're not a doormat. That's incel rage / resentment bullshit.

I suggest that people go out of their way to give others a lot of service and attention as a habit. Instead of trying to ""not do free shit for women when you meet them"", go out there and do interesting shit for everyone as a habit. You're going to end up giving women free attention anyway, but it's not going to feel forced if your default mode is to be engaged with the world already. By having more men on a mission in the marketplace, the supply of beta-providers and chad-manwhores will diminish and enable for more effective mating. Maybe.",8,1
How masculinity changed my life,"Ok let me preface by saying this....I disavow a lot of the attitudes on here these days. It‚Äôs not the core teachings, it‚Äôs the people who don‚Äôt understand them and try to lecture others.


I started reading this material maybe 4 or 5 years ago. At the time, I was living in the basement of a chiropractor with my roommate who had a wall of Pok√©mon merch. I was lucky if I got laid 10 times in those miserable 3 years (I will say, looking back it was a fun time and more innocent, but I was not a man)

I was in the anger phase for years....than came fitness, which changed my life. I am no longer a junkie drug addict and I‚Äôm never looking back (luckily never got on anything too hard) 


Anyways, so I met this couple at a bar in 2019. The girl started coming onto me recently...within the past few months. She‚Äôs told me everything about her and her mans relationship and she‚Äôs cheated on him with me several times (we have not had intercourse but have been very sexual with eachother) she is a 9/10 euro hottie dime piece 


Anyways, this is after the past year of being a manwhore (where I‚Äôm from no one gives a fuck about covid) so I come to find out this girls father is a multi millionaire....yea okay. I‚Äôm still a broke as loser even if I‚Äôm masculine af now


So she starts telling me all the secrets....her and her man were supposed to be together forever blah blah blah...he‚Äôs sterile and she wants kids, purposely avoided feminism and college because she wanted to be a mother (I‚Äôve confirmed that this is true and she isn‚Äôt bullshitting)


So here‚Äôs the kicker: she now wants to leave her man to be with me. She gets super drunk and tells me to impregnate her and her daddy will take care of everything....marriage, house, and give me money to start a business of my dreams. I come from broke chump poor hillbilly land. 


I said whatever and thought it was all bullshit, until I did some ‚Äúresearch‚Äù- her dad is loaded beyond belief. I found his linkedin (confirmed its the same dude) and his resume is beyond unbelievable, he‚Äôs got stacks for days. 


I‚Äôm at a cross point here. I‚Äôm a big believer in law of attraction and manifestation, it worked. I just need to get her away from that dude and knock her ass up.


The only thing that matters throughout all of these redpill teachings is be masculine af and pass the shit tests....It will take you places you would never believe.....",36,1
How to keep a balance of being funny and masculine frame.,"All my life people always tell me I‚Äôm one of the funniest person they have ever meet. I enjoy making people laugh and I just can‚Äôt stop cracking jokes I crack them throughout the whole day I‚Äôm actually addicted to making jokes. 

After binging the alpha male strategy videos he talks about how keeping a masculine frame is the most Important thing and too many jokes and laughing at your own jokes turns the female off as it makes you look goofy and women aren‚Äôt interested in goofy people . He also talks about how the funny people make jokes to compensate for a lacking quality. I disagree with that part only because for example I only started gym recently so I‚Äôm still quite skinny never have I made a joke to compensate for my lack of muscle and good shape, I just love making jokes. 

When talking to a girl I‚Äôm interested what should I do? Should I keep a balance of both funny and masculine frame or should I only keep a masculine frame the whole time? Or should the masculine frame out-weight the jokes.    I just need to know how to act for next week because I had a big possibility to talk the girl I‚Äôm really Interested in.",2,1

How to level up your mindset: Assumptions Lead to Ruin. Here‚Äôs How to Avoid Them.,"Throughout history, you can find countless examples of peoples‚Äô assumptions ruining their relationships with others, destroying their chances of potential success, and creating needless obstacles for them. What helpful mindsets can you adopt in order to avoid these same mistakes?

**(1) Don‚Äôt interpret ambiguous statements as negative.**

An ambiguous statement is any statement that doesn‚Äôt give you enough context to know the underlying intent behind it. A good example would be the word ‚Äúokay‚Äù.

There is no way for you to truly know what someone intended by using the word, and assuming that the intent behind it was negative is only harmful for you. Even someone‚Äôs tone of voice or body language may not reflect the true meaning behind their statement. It could just be the mood that they‚Äôre in at the time, which may have nothing to do with their feelings about you.

Overthinking it will make you come off as insecure, it will push people away, and it will also waste your time and energy. It‚Äôs best not to assume in these situations because you simply don‚Äôt know. Even IF their ambiguous comment meant something negative, you have no proof, which makes the accusation meaningless. Ultimately, it‚Äôs best to just move on without letting it affect your behaviors.

**(2) Don‚Äôt assume that you know what someone wants or doesn't want.**

A lot of times, people make assumptions about others‚Äô wants in order to maintain the same comfortable dynamic that they have with the other person. If the relationship with the other person seems to be working, why change anything? However, this alienates the other person.

What can end up happening is that you assume something about someone, and then THEY assume something about you due to you making that assumption about them, and then this builds up hidden resentment on both sides.

Just because someone is tolerating a behavior for the time-being, doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs what they want. Sure, they should speak up as well, but it‚Äôs on you to take action to make this into a reality.

If you were to continue to go out of your way to act in a manner that you thought someone wanted, but that was actually bothering them, this would be highly inefficient. It will lead to childish arguments, and you can even end up ruining valuable friendships and relationships.

Make sure to ask someone either directly or indirectly about any assumptions that you have about their wants or needs before to taking them as a given.

**(3) Don‚Äôt assume that someone is out to ruin you.**

Of course, this doesn‚Äôt mean that you shouldn‚Äôt have boundaries to protect yourself, which is topic that we‚Äôll explore in the future. It‚Äôs also doesn‚Äôt mean that you shouldn‚Äôt exercise caution and notice red flags, while making sure not to just divulge everything to everyone. This is naivety.

What it does mean is to put the ego and paranoia away. You‚Äôre not a mind-reader. Unless someone took an action that directly indicated potential harm to you, then you CANNOT have this mindset if you want to be successful. However, if someone‚Äôs potentially harmful actions become a pattern, then it‚Äôs best to move on from that relationship with the other person because they now bring more negatives than positives to your life.

And of course, there are always exceptions to every rule. There are situations where assumptions are necessary. For example, in situations where you have to protect yourself, and have little time to think, you have to make assumptions in order to act fast. That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs being referred to here.

Ultimately, if you‚Äôre not aware of how assumptions can be harmful to your social interactions, it will ruin you.

**Takeaways:**

**(1)** **Don‚Äôt interpret ambiguous statements as negative.**

**(2) Don‚Äôt assume that you know what someone wants or doesn't want.**

**(3) Don‚Äôt assume that someone is out to ruin you.**

Toxic Masculinity Doesn't Exist - An Essay,"Toxic Masculinity doesn't exist. Don't even acknowledge the term. It's specifically used as a dog-whistle to automatically associate negative traits with just existing as a man. Sort of like ""deplorables"" was used by Hillary to disenfranchise poor white voters, how the term ""thugs"" is currently used as a placeholder for the ""n-word"" by racist idiots, and the sarcastic use of ""religion of peace"" is used by racist losers to refer to Muslims in the media, the terms aren't meant to explain or highlight any sort of behavior as much as they are used to associate negative traits with certain groups and encourage irrational hate against them. It's a trigger word used to do what females do best: **causing divisions by way of Relational Aggression.**

These terms are a form of relational aggression. They're trying to encourage a culture where open discrimination against men in public places like work and school will be acceptable. If it becomes publicly acceptable, it's going to become a word used to do nothing other than shut men down by shaming them in public.

Disagree with a female on something, even if you're right? Toxic Masculinity. Focus on yourself and improve your life without helping them? Toxic masculinity. Improve your station at work or in school through honest, hard work? Toxic Masculinity. Don't bend over backwards wasting all of your time or money on a female? Toxic masculinity.

Don't let it snowball because that's what they're aiming for.

It should be as offensive to you to have that term ***even be used in public***, just like it is to refer to blacks as ""thugs,"" poor whites as ""deplorables,"" or sarcastically use the phrase ""religion of peace"" when referring to Muslims or Middle Easterners. Imagine actually using those terms RIGHT NOW in your workplace, school, or other public places. You would get CRUCIFIED because they absolutely are horrible terms to use and their connotations are KNOWN. Everyone knows they are placeholders for more hateful words use by trashy low-lifes at the fringes of society.

Feminists look at *""strong""* female role models and refer to them as ""positive, encouraging, empowering"" but men who have those exact same traits, if they're even allowed to exist in mainstream media anymore, are referred to exhibiting ""toxic masculinity"" ONLY because they're men and for no other reason. Don't let misandry be publicly acceptable behavior online or in real life.

Don't answer to or acknowledge the term Toxic Masculinity - it's a losing proposition. You're getting bullied into working against yourselves by acknowledging it exists. By answering to it, you're opening the door that allows those conversations to happen and for the environment I explained above to flourish. Toxic masculinity doesn't exist and anyone that does use it should be looked down on and shut-out.",56,1
Karens get things done. Be a karen.,"I am SO fucking tired of people just complaining about their issues to themselves. What in the FUCK will that EVER do? Hm? NOTHING. 

Have you ever wondered why all this pro-women and anti-men shit has been blowing up recently? Have you? Netflix didnt remove all the Johnny depp content because they didnt like Johnny depp. They removed it because thousands of people were contacting netflix and complaining everyday. Netflix doesnt want controversy, netflix doesnt want to lose money. So even though the allegations against depp were proven false, they still took his movies down. Karen's got this done. Karens!

You need to be a karen. Dont be retarded. Dont think you're strong because you just accept your problems. That's ignorance. Seriously, ask yourself. What does that do? How in the world is just ignoring your probelms beneficial? Ask. Yourself. IT ISNT. IT FUCKING ISNT. Its harmful not only to you but to ALL men. Get the fuck off your ass and do something about it. See sexism? See misandry? See inequality? CALL IT THE FUCK OUT! COMPLAIN! BITCH! MOAN! WHINE! BOYCOTT! FUCKING DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!

Be a man of principle. If you see something wrong, stay true to yourself and do something about it. Dont just let it be. You ALL need to learn this lesson. Get. Things. Done. Next time you see something wrong. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. If you dont, you're not only a disgrace to yourself, you're a disgrace to your entire gender.

Appreciations &amp; Ruminations following my Red Pill Journey (Part 3/3),"In my previous post, I talked about how the process of internalizing a new belief is hard as fuck, because de-conditioning oneself requires a lot of work. And it will be difficult for certain TRP practitioners to take the first step at all because of the sheer unwillingness of the ego to go through the unlearning process that requires them to reject a part of their identity.

Many tendencies are also buried into the subconscious, well-hidden from our ‚Äúconscious‚Äù way of operating. To alter such a deep aspect of oneself would thus take a lot more than simply wishing for it.

With such rigid obstacles in the way, it‚Äôs simply unfortunate that many guys will never be able to fully internalize a new belief system. But we acknowledge that thus is life.

In my first post, I wrote that I am no longer part of this community, the reason being that TRP could no longer help me go any further. What I mean more precisely is that, for the full 2 years I‚Äôve been on this sub, while I solved the superficial issues I had pre-TRP, I never got anywhere close to dealing with certain other deeper problems I had.

Problems originating from **my huge lack of inward focus.**

## #3: Rediscover your Humanity

Recall the 4w‚Äôs I‚Äôve briefly alluded to in my first post:

1. **What** did I want? Pussy.
2. **When** did I want it? Asap.
3. **Who** wanted it? Well, me obviously.
4. **How** did I get it? TRP was the toolbox.

But there‚Äôs the grand, albeit cheesy question that gets grossly overlooked, but I would argue to actually be the most important: *Why did I want pussy?* Back then, I would‚Äôve answered something along the lines of: ‚ÄúEasy, I like to fill holes because it feels good,‚Äù then continued about my day.

But that answer is incomplete.

When I contemplate how good it feels to have the tip of my penis sucked on, that‚Äôs the ‚Äúanimal‚Äù part of me manifesting itself. It‚Äôs biological: most guys can relate to me because our bodies function the same. So when I answer from that standpoint, I know I can be met with a universal ‚Äúno shit bro‚Äù.

But what about me, **Jaccalope?** What about the **‚Äúhuman‚Äù** part of me? That part of me that likes to discover and learn new things, to create a legacy? The Mona Lisa to her Da Vinci? The humanity within me that likes to arbitrarily attach meaning to certain events and objects where there is ‚Äúobjectively‚Äù or ‚Äúscientifically‚Äù none?

*How does having pussy answer that part of me?* Does it make me feel more masculine? More enlightened? More powerful? Or am I using it as a tool to escape my problems, like a drug?

Basically, during my stay in this community, I was never able to answer the following question to myself: *What personal craving does sexual intimacy with a woman satisfy beyond physical stimulation?*

My inability to answer this laid the foundations for the faulty trajectory I created for my TRP journey.

&amp;#x200B;

**Journey highlight #3:** In my first post, I talked about how, aside from the lack of pussy, I was doing pretty well. To complement it alongside the success of my other areas, I started boosting my SMV:

* Tangibly; through lifting, wardrobe cleansing, studying harder, etc., and.
* Artificially; through gaming, speech techniques, and perception manipulation.

In the beginning, I boosted my SMV to get girls. But as I got more familiarized with the ‚ÄúTRP way‚Äù of doing things, I started telling myself that I was boosting my SMV for myself. That trying to score higher body counts, garnering more respect, and landing a high-paying job was for the sake of my own happiness.

But as I attached more of my self-worth into my own perception of SMV, I subconsciously started to give lots of fucks about objectively being a high value man. And it showed.

For example, I would have no issues disagreeing on matters of personal taste (pineapple on pizzas are delicious btw) but would often feel insecure if there was a guy in the same room as me that I thought had better looks and game than me. Because the presence of such a man threatened who I wanted to be. I wanted to be at the top of the totem pole, and having others being better than me in my direct environment made me feel uneasy.

However, I never paid much attention to such feelings; I simply just tried to dismiss them using some meditative ‚Äúlet-it-go‚Äù techniques and reinforced the belief that I needed to keep working on my SMV. That I needed to keep my tunnel vision and get to the top asap. Once there, I thought, all my problems would go away.

But there is *one very notable event* where I couldn‚Äôt shake off those feelings, no matter how much I wanted to or tried to distract myself. And it‚Äôs that occurrence that planted the first seeds of doubt into my own conscious, the first time I‚Äôve ever poked at my own structure of beliefs and asked myself: ‚ÄúAm I doing something wrong?‚Äù

It was a party-like event where a bunch of my friends and I gathered together. As I was enjoying myself, one of my friends introduced me to a friend of his. I instantly recognized this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù as a girl I had a huge crush on a few years prior, but never initiated due to my pursuit of another girl at the time. I was a bit envious at first, but barely enough to catch myself in the thought. As the night progressed though, I noticed them interacting; the way she was looking at him, the way her body moved to stick to his, the way she caressed his chin and pulled him in for the kiss‚Ä¶ Fuck. That KILLED me. My inner voice went ballistic. I got envious and insecure as fuck. It got to a point where I could no longer interact properly with others for the duration of that event. I couldn‚Äôt hold frame without my discontentment bleeding out into my behavior. What a shitty night.

From that event forward, I started to doubt my TRP journey. The following question was haunting me: ‚ÄúIf I can fuck bitches, if I‚Äôm high SMV, why the fuck did I feel so much envy?‚Äù Because while my SMV didn‚Äôt lie, my feelings didn‚Äôt lie either. Every single ounce in my body knew it felt envy. **I thought that with the progress of my TRP journey, such feelings would go away too. But they didn't.**

I also didn‚Äôt know where to look for the answers. I did not bother bringing this issue to TRP, because I didn‚Äôt want to be shamed for having such insecurities.

Instead, I just continued doing what I always knew: I worked on my SMV and kept giving advice to the community. By distracting myself with familiar, affirmative tasks, I slowly got to bury that dreadful experience somewhere into my deep conscience. 

Hence, the thought that there would be a huge difference between **how I thought I‚Äôd feel** in my self-improving TRP journey vs. **how I actually felt** bugged the hell out of me. I started acknowledging that there may be a massive red area in my life but couldn‚Äôt for the life of me pinpoint what it was.

\[‚Ä¶\]

Earlier, I introduced the following question: *What personal craving does sexual intimacy satisfy beyond physical stimulation?* If this was asked around the period where that event happened, I‚Äôd have no idea what it meant nor how to answer that.

But after the progress I‚Äôve made post-TRP, I can and will answer on the behalf of my past self exactly what it was:

Having a high body count is an indicator that I am a desirable man. That some woman out there wants me. *Sharing sexual intimacy was thus a buffer to my self-worth.*

But I can even take this one step further, beyond intersexual dynamics. Because, in fact, my whole faulty construct of SMV revolved around the same concept:

**That someone out there would want me.**

Beyond having options, spinning multiple plates **should guarantee me more female validation.**

Beyond a good salary, a high-paying job **should guarantee me more social recognition.**

The insidious truth is that, beyond the obvious end-goal, these SMV pillars were buffers that served to satisfy a deep-rooted emotional emptiness. Where every time I hit the targeted goal, that emptiness gets filled for a brief moment and I could rejoice. Where, conversely, every time I missed the targeted goal, that emptiness resurfaced briefly to remind me how much of a useless piece of trash I was.

When I came to TRP, I wanted to fix the lack of pussy. But I never realized how wanting to fix that meant **that my happiness standards included pussy in the first place**. That a part of my self-worth was invested into how often other girls are attracted to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pitfall #3:** Throughout my TRP journey, my lack of inward focus rushed me into a trajectory that only served to magnify the unhealthy mental models I used pre-TRP. By revolving my self-worth and my purpose around an objective measure of SMV, I was bound to feel insecure around people with objectively better SMV. Basically, by not being the alpha in the room when all I care is about being alpha‚Ä¶ well I felt like shit.

Whereas pre-TRP, my sense of worth came from being externally validated, my TRP phase merely created an extension of that called ‚Äúbeing objectively high SMV‚Äù. Being successful to me meant being high SMV, without ever pondering the fact that SMV was defined to me by some internet strangers who based measures of human value by societal standards.

And in the process of making societal standards the voices of affirmation backing my journey to success, I unknowingly discarded the most important voice of all‚Ä¶ my own.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reflection #3:** Consider the following two phrases that, at first, seem to mean the same thing, but actually imply significantly different things:

1. A high value man fucks a lot of women.
2. The man who fucks a lot of women is high value.

In which statement does being ‚Äúthe man‚Äù mean more to you? (1) or (2)? Because beyond the grammatical subject/object difference, those two phrases do not believe in the same thing.

I used to think that statement (2) was the way to go, not only for women, but for all I did:

* **Action:** I need to fuck a lot of women | **Conclusion:** I‚Äôm high SMV.
* **Action:** I need to secure a high-paying job | **Conclusion:** I‚Äôm high SMV.
* **Action:** I need to befriend popular people | **Conclusion:** I‚Äôm high SMV.

By having such actions precede the conclusion that I'm high SMV, I fell into the trap of relying on *external measures of progress* to feed my self-worth. Can you see it?

Without ever considering that switching the subject/object could still stand:

* **Action:** I‚Äôm high SMV | **Conclusion:** I can fuck a lot of women.
* **Action:** I‚Äôm high SMV | **Conclusion:** I can secure a high-paying job.
* **Action:** I‚Äôm high SMV | **Conclusion**: I can befriend popular people.

This may seem counterintuitive. The main argument would be that a high SMV man is made, not born. It would thus technically be impossible for ‚Äúhigh SMV‚Äù to precede any of its pillars, wouldn‚Äôt it?

This is where I say: **My value as a man is (and should be) subjective.** Let me explain.

The issue with having everything defined objectively is that definitions are bound to start heated debates. Because of people‚Äôs general difference in upbringing and understanding of their environment, there will never be an agreed upon consensus.

I want to take that further though: What is the point on reaching a consensus? To make a religion out of TRP? To smack some commandments into the faces of its followers and make them abide to some cookie-cutter protocol? To then make them atone for their ‚Äúsins‚Äù? Fuck that, there are enough religions out there, and the world certainly doesn‚Äôt need to create an extra group of martyrs for a stupid cause.

But I get the appeal to define certain concepts objectively.

1. Science needs data. In order to measure certain variables, scientists need to operate with a consistent and clear definition of certain concepts in order to interpret data.
2. Objectivism creates a sense of unity, a sense of cause that people can throw themselves at.

**But the need to define everything objectively inevitably comes with need for conformity too.** In an attempt to not dissociate from the pack, a man may have to bend his own boundaries‚Ä¶

In an attempt to avoid ostracization, a man may have to go against his gut feeling‚Ä¶

And in an attempt to remain ‚Äúa red-pilled alpha‚Äù, a man may have to go against the ‚Äúbeta‚Äù thing to do, even if he knows, deep down, that it's the thing he wants to do.

*You see where I‚Äôm getting at?*

When I started TRP, I strictly thought in terms of red and blue. ‚ÄúWhat would alphas do? What would betas do?‚Äù But as I got more assertive with my way of doing things, there were times where I would doubt certain thoughts because they did not follow the TRP conformity of doing things. In my unwillingness to put myself first, I was limited by the knowledge of what I learned in this community. I couldn‚Äôt go further without sometimes having my own desires clash with what TRP preached.

And even though that inner voice of mine was screaming to get heard, I was never able to put it first. It was always something else that came first: my parents‚Äô obligations for my early childhood, social pressures through my teenage years, then TRP thereafter.

Some obsessive need to get things done the ‚Äúright way‚Äù.

But what if life doesn‚Äôt need to be done ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù? What if I instead just craved doing it ‚Äúmy‚Äù way?

That‚Äôs the **humanity** within us that I alluded to earlier: the desire to execute our journey in our own imperfect way. The part of us who craves a challenge, who expresses art as an extension of himself, who can bring innovation. Without acknowledging this humanity, we cannot be purposeful in our truest intents. Without using this beautiful gift that is our own freedom, we are simply animals, confined by the limitations of the tribe and of our own brains.

Beyond thinking in shades of **red vs. blue**, I evolved to think in terms of what works **FOR ME** vs. what doesn‚Äôt work **FOR ME**. Not what women want me to be. Not what society wants me to be. And certainly not what TRP wants me to be.

But who I want to be. To become my own ultimate judge.

To me, all those platitudes about ‚Äúalpha/beta dynamics‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt LTR single moms‚Äù, ‚Äúhypergamy doesn‚Äôt care‚Äù are noise. They‚Äôre just another bunch of cool mesh of words trying to conform me to an idea. To prevent me from failing. And I would argue the very reason why TRP became a shadow of itself is because the LARPers love talking so frequently about **what not to do** instead of **letting each other take an L and let their own experience and introspection become their teacher.**

If you go against TRP protocol and decide to get married, the gun may always be loaded and ready to fire. But what they omit to tell you is that you also have the ability to point your eyes straight into the barrel and smirk in full confidence saying: ‚ÄúI dare you.‚Äù Because the man who builds and defines his own value **from who he is, and not what he has,** knows that the woman has so much more to lose than him. Would you put your money on a random guy in this sub to do this?

If you want to get married (the ultimate TRP sin), take the necessary precautions, live it out, and see for yourself. No one but your ""red pilled alpha conscience"" actually gives a shit.

Ultimately, be the one to call the shots. Be the one to choose your mistakes. What a goddamn blessing that is!

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion &amp; Solution #3:** To become a high value man, from what I've seen, goes beyond the affirmation of superficial traits like spinning plates, net worth, status, etc. It transcends the Red Pill and the Blue Pill, the alpha and the beta. But what being high SMV in your life actually means is for you to discover by yourself.

But what I can say with certainty is that my personal definition required **inward focus.**

I went through some traumatic experiences in my life. Whether that may be a bullying experience, a childhood abandonment experience, a tragedy, or whatever else, they‚Äôve made me suffer. And given the tools I had at the time, my only solution was to cope by suppressing it deep into my subconscious, hoping to never ever deal with it ever again.

What inward focus requires is to solve that issue once and for all rather than  avoiding it any longer. Because by keeping it hidden underneath, I‚Äôm passively allowing it to bleed into my belief systems without being fully aware of it.

Inward focus means to be able to yank that wounded kid up from my deep conscience, to have him sit in a chair opposite from mine, to allow him to feel the full extent of his pain, and to comfort him whenever he needs me to. Because to give myself the space and time to fully lean into that experience gives me the proper closure to let this experience no longer hold me back.

I even cried a little doing so.

All of this sounds stupid, doesn‚Äôt it? Who cares, it worked for me.

And if you've done everything I did but somehow are in the best possible place physically and mentally of your life, then that's great too. Who am I to discredit your experience? Just do what works for you.

\[‚Ä¶\]

This write-up turned out way longer and messier than originally anticipated. So here's a **TL;DR:**

1. Do what you want, regardless of alpha/beta/redpilled/bluepilled. By doing things not through the ‚Äúred pilled alpha‚Äù way, but through your own instinctual way, you give yourself the opportunity to experience how a certain action may impact you differently;
2. Be aware to not neglect the inner aspect of yourself. How you feel can often be the symptom of a deep-rooted issue that may or may not require better coping methods down the line;
3. Operating with your own subjective belief system rather than this community‚Äôs objective one will add a personal touch of depth into your life that this community will NEVER be able to offer.",29,1

Helping Yourself,"**Thinking back.**

I think back on countless times where I have tried to help people and for the life of me I cannot think of a time where the outcome was what I wanted. Every time I have helped people and tried to share my prosperity it has always been rewarded with jealousy , backstabbing and at a minimum just being taken advantage of, without the initial goal of actually trying to teach someone, or help them out of a bad situation being accomplished. The worst part is all that diverted energy could have been spent on my own endeavors. I have employed people at my construction company, found people high paying easy jobs, helped men get custody of their children and helped people struggling with addiction and worst of all lent my brother tens of thousands of dollars that I will never see again.

**The reason that these endeavors are a waste of time and resources.**

They didn‚Äôt ask for help. I saw that they were struggling and I knew I had the solution to help them, with their relationship, get a better job, get educated, pay their rent, or a plethora of other situations that helpless people find themselves in. The problem lies in the attitude towards the solution. The person has no skin in the game, if you offer to help them out of nowhere they often think you have some ulterior motive or that you are using them in some way. The path to success becomes muddied and harder to trek for both parties, especially when the giver feels taken advantage of because the person being helped is not thankful, or even resentful of the help because of false pride or other reasons.

**The solution.**

The solution is to focus solely on yourself and what helps you; at most reach out to your extended nuclear family. I consider this to be my nuclear family and close friends. The catch is to **only offer help when it is asked for. There are some men that will never ask for help, if they are your close friend I would personally help them, a lot is learnt through struggle though, so you might be stripping them of the opportunity to learn from the hardship.** People know that you know the answer to their problem, or that you can pick up really heavy shit that they can‚Äôt, or that you have money to lend because your not credit rich and can read a fucking book on how to invest money. The key is make them ask you and that there be an understanding that **just because they ask, doesn‚Äôt mean you do it,** just like children, people need to be told no or they will think that you are at their service. After all you have your own path to trek and any help diverted to their needs takes away from your own journey, it's hard enough to carry our own water.

**Why to help those around you.**

The reason we help people is because we have the plan, we know how to make money, create and increase our resource pool and generally build the people around us just by setting the correct example, but under no circumstances do I think that people who are undeserving should be rewarded with that knowledge or our time to help them out of self imposed situations that they are in. I mean if I found myself trudging through a shit life, I would do whatever it took to find prosperity and everything that comes with it, source: **I have**.

Those closest to us deserve our attention if we want to have a thriving community and actually enjoy the network of people around us. But they need to ask for help, because they understand that you know the way, and when they become successful because of your help they need to bring more to the communal table then they did before so that the time and money that you have invested in them can be returned with the multiplier effect so that you can enjoy the resources that you originally invested in them and ultimately share in their successes.

These are some of my thoughts on building the network around us and weeding the mooches and losers out of it, it's been on my mind a lot as I have been working from home a lot and am really looking forward to building up my community and the new adventures I have planned for 2021. I really do not see exceptions to this, i would expect children, spouses and family members to all contribute as much as they can to the collective and any freeloaders or mooches should be kicked to the curb as fast as possible, or in the case of nuclear family, taught how to act correctly, which is your job as a leader anyway.

I don't mean, do not be a good person, that means something different to everyone, just know that every minute spent on someone else is a minute you will never get back. The vast majority of your time should be invested in you and what you find to be important.",15,1

Have you ever noticed that your eyes automatically move towards hot girls while you‚Äôre walking down the street or going about your day to day life?

Sometimes you and the hot girl walk past each other. Sometimes you walk past them from behind, sometimes they pass you if they‚Äôre in a hurry.

Point is, have you ever considered that you can actually have a conversation with these girls walking past you every day instead of just staring at them for a brief moment? (And even avoiding eye contact if you‚Äôre beta enough lmao)

The only problem is, it‚Äôs not that easy to stop a girl that‚Äôs on the move... Sure you can approach them, but most of the time they‚Äôll just keep walking... after all, it‚Äôs Covid-19... and strangers are dangerous! Sigh...

Meaning you‚Äôll have to chase after them and walk with them like a low value beta.

Don‚Äôt believe me? Try it out. Try approaching a girl on the move in 2021 and you‚Äôll see how difficult it is to get them to stop and have a conversation with you, unless you live in a rural area or something...

Until a week ago, I thought that girls on the move were off limits. I mean, they have places to go right? And besides, they all have masks on... they‚Äôre probably scared of Covid-19...

And every time I approached them, it only seemed to reinforce that fact. The majority of them didn‚Äôt stop when I approached.

They just kept walking... and walking...

And these are girls that seemed open to being approached, not the ones with earphones on lol

Sometimes, I‚Äôd follow after them and continue talking to them, walking side by side, but I don‚Äôt think a single approach like that worked out.

I mean, I was clearly chasing after her and the girl could see that... she‚Äôs not stupid, she knows she‚Äôs higher value than you if you chase that hard and follow her around like a dog on a leash...

I tried a bunch of different approach strategies too.

I tried walking up and tapping them on the shoulder. I tried walking up and telling them they‚Äôre cute, walking up and talking about something interesting in the environment...

Nothing seemed to work. Everything I did only seemed to reinforce my belief that these girls walking around from place to place were not meant to be approached. They had places to be... people to see...

**And that‚Äôs when I met Dan: The Salesman from Costco who single handedly taught me that there‚Äôs a better way...**

If you ever met me, you‚Äôd know that I almost never stop when homeless people ask me for money on the street, or salespeople approach me at Costco.

I had the mindset that I don‚Äôt have time to deal with that shit.

So looking back, I probably missed out on some cool offers from the Costco reps that I genuinely would have enjoyed. Probably missed out on interesting conversations with homeless people too.

Dan from Costco was different though.

Dan was able to get me to stop and listen to his sales pitch...

(I think it was home delivered water or something)

When it first happened I didn‚Äôt even know what hit me. I just sat there and answered question after question about how I pay for water, how much water I drink a month, etc.

I was like, how the fuck did I end up in this sales pitch? This usually never happens...

And then it hit me. Something about Dan‚Äôs approach compelled me to physically stop walking and listen to what he had to say.

I waited for him to finish his train of thought and immediately told him what was on my mind. I told him that I almost never stop when salespeople approach me. And I told him I wanted to know how to do exactly what he just did to me.

Dan looked at me like I was autistic. LMAO

I laughed and told him I‚Äôm utterly serious. I wanted to know his secret on how he could get people to stop what they‚Äôre doing and listen to his sales pitch.

I even offered to buy a 3 months supply of his water delivery service on the spot no questions asked if he was willing to help out.

So there I was jogging back in the middle of Costco and walking towards a very confused Dan again so I could try to figure out exactly what he was doing differently from everyone else.

I noticed several differences immediately.

1. First, he waved to get my attention when I was like 8 yards away. This meant that I noticed him from a distance already
2. Second, he held out his hand in a stop sign ‚úã about 4 yards from when I was on top of his sales booth, and delivered his opener. ‚ÄúExcuse me real quick, I have a question. How much are you paying for your water every month?‚Äù. This meant that I had plenty of time to stop instead of continuing to walk like I usually do.

Do you see how intelligent this kind of approach is?

Usually homeless people just ask for money at the last second when you‚Äôre right next to them, making it super easy to just keep walking past them.

Dan, on the other hand, waved to grab my attention from a good distance away, and delivered his opener from 4 yards away, meaning it would be socially weird for me to not stop.

He turned the tables.

For all those homeless people on the street, it would take active effort on my part to stop and engage them in conversation.

With Dan, it would take active effort on my part to keep walking.

**People LIKE taking the path of least resistance.** Myself included. That‚Äôs just the way it is.

The funny thing is, Dan himself didn‚Äôt even know how brilliant his approach was. He was just doing this shit naturally.

I didn‚Äôt care though. He taught me everything I needed to know. So after I paid for a 3 month supply of his water as promised...

I immediately tried this out on a hot girl who was walking into Costco from her car.

Like I said, usually girls on the move are very difficult to stop and have a conversation with, especially during the Pandemic.

But this time, I followed all the steps.

1. I waved at her from 8 yards away and smiled. She smiled back.
2. I held out my hand in a stop sign ‚úã and opened her indirectly, ‚Äúexcuse me real quick, I was on my way to the XYZ restaurant it‚Äôs supposed to be right here but I can‚Äôt find it.‚Äù
3. Blah blah blah, ‚Äúoh by the way, you have a creative and artistic vibe. Are you an artist?‚Äù

Boom!

I kid you not. Full 20 minute conversation in the Costco Parking lot. Tons of flirting and swapped Instagrams at the end.

I repeated this exact technique on 5 other girls over the past week (making sure they noticed me from a distance, and delivering my opener from 4 yards away with my hand held out.

**Every Single One Of The Girls Stopped In Their Tracks**. And had a conversation with me.

Already have dates lined with with 2 of them

Covid-19 made it so the path of least resistance for a hot girl is to keep walking when a stranger approaches them.

But when you simply make sure they notice you as you approach, and give them enough time to stop, **They Will Stop Every Time**. They won‚Äôt know why they stopped, but they‚Äôll stop.

Because it would take active effort on their part to keep walking.

# Lessons Learned

If you‚Äôre too scared to even approach a girl, then this technique isn‚Äôt for you. Learn the basics of daygame first by approaching girls waiting in line or girls standing still that smile at you as you make eye contact with them.

And if you‚Äôre too scared of Covid to approach, then by all means continue monk mode. I don‚Äôt have anything against men who try to do the right thing to keep others safe.

But if you‚Äôve been at it for a while...

If you‚Äôre sick and tired of this lockdown bullshit...

If you want to exercise your daygame skills on women who were previously off limits because they‚Äôre walking quickly, I urge you to use what you learned to immediately get every single girl you approach to at least stop and have a conversation with you.

Nobody else is approaching them in such a calibrated way.

Why?,"**Tl;Dr:**


Questioning: Why? Will disarm, dismantle and destroy most people's behavior, beliefs and emotions. Make sure yours can stand up to *Why?*


**Body:**


Simply put most people can't defend their positions versus a few levels of *Why?* With the shear amount of information out there everyone's an expert because they've read a couple articles from some *professional* about a topic. They devoured the material with the intent of regurgitating the information later on. They didn't take the time to think, actually digesting the information, applying it through action in their own lives.

It's not just on estranged topics. They have no reasoning for life long moral codes, political opinions, societal views, daily habits and behaviors. Basically, the majority of what makes up your average person; beliefs, emotions and actions, exists without much thought. The entirety of their existence cannot survive a couple rounds of *Why?*

By now you should be picturing that five-year-old questioning their parents with genuine curiosity, *Well why Mommy? Ohhhh, why's that Mommy? Because why Mommy? Because why?* Eventually the parent's patience and knowledge of the random topic is tested, **Just because!**

Turns out most people last as long as the typical mother or father being questioned by their five-year-old kid.Three to six *Why?s* and logic disintegrates into *just because* and *feelings.*

One of my main plates essentially gave up complaining to me about *my poor behavior.* She hates arguing with me because *I make her feel wrong.* I'm not explaining away my behavior. All I'm doing is asking *Why it's upsetting to her?* After a few minutes of listening and questioning it always ends the same; *Well it just bothers me; I don't know why.* Meaning she's realized her anger is unjustified. Doesn't stop her from being katty but it ends the conversation. 

*Ohh really why's that?* Is also a great way to keep a conversation flowing. Most the time people are talking to you, they don't actually want or need your opinion, they want someone to talk at. Just ask them questions about the topic and they'll be exstatic.


You should also be questioning your actions, emotions and beliefs, not with a quality of doubt but with that childlike curiosity described above. 

Questioning your actions; *Why am I doing this?* can rationalize in the moment behaviors if you can attribute them to long term goals or stop an action that might hinder obtaining your goal. Take a more analytical view of your actions; *Why am I performing X like Y?* Allows you to take a closer look at functions of a repetitive task, keeping the goal in mind, you can pinpoint certain aspects of the task to perform faster, with better form, ease, efficiency and ergonomics. You can move in confidence if you can answer to yourself, *Why you're performing and acting with certain intent?*

Questioning your emotions; *Why am I feeling angry?* Because of X. *Well, why is X upsetting?* X is upsetting because it triggers Y. *Why is Y triggering?* With this line of thought you can rationalize away anger. By that I mean the majority of the time you, yourself end up at a *just because.* Realizing it's not really worth getting bothered about, helps you react with a cool head. Most negative emotions can be rationalized away like this. Especially dealing with women, you getting upset with her is futile. *Check your ego.* Hos will be hos. 

You can also question away your positive emotions. Asking, *Why does this make me happy?* Will do one of two things, the first, you might realize the action/behavior doesn't actually make you happy. It could be the people or you could just be doing it out of habit. Having out grown the joy it once brought you.

The other way it can go, if you really do enjoy what's going on, you figure out *why you enjoy it.* Again giving you an area to fixate on. Once you can pick out what and *why you enjoy,* you start developing taste. If you know you like X, Y and Z about A, when looking for B you can use X, Y and Z as qualifiers. Flip it, if you know you don't like Q about A, B must not have Q. You now have standards.

Questioning; *Why do I believe X?* can help prevent you from believing something stupid all your life. Turns out you're miss guided, you were miss informed, held a false belief or just didn't know. When you question your beliefs and can continuously answer yourself, *Why you're living life this way?* With sound, reassuring logic, you build confidence in the way you're living. Not just that but by continually questioning your beliefs, you expand and develop them further.


I don't know,* is much more respectable than *just because* or *feelings.* It takes responsibility for the lack of knowledge and understanding.  If it's of value to you, you'll find the answer. 

*In Conclusion:*

Questioning a person with *Why?* ends pretty quickly *in feelings and just because.* Questioning your own actions allows you to move with confidence and improve your overall performance. Questioning your emotions can help keep them in line by rationalize momentary feeling. Questioning why you enjoy or do not enjoy can help develop taste and standards. Questioning your beliefs or long-term goals can help you live in confidence.",23,1

Why the Red Pill Is so Difficult,"At first.

#Addiction
Anyone who has experienced the challenge and difficulty of overcoming, and ultimately defeating, an addiction knows why defeating it is so hard. Generally, there are two forms of addiction, physiological and psychological. Physiologically, withdrawal symptoms set in and gain in intensity usually within the first 24-48 hours. After 3-4 days, the symptoms subside, and physiologically the body and brain have adjusted to the new normal, and are no longer require the offending substance or activity. This is not the difficult part of overcoming addiction. Psychologically, the habitual use forms a challenging pattern of behavior, and it is this part of the addiction that is difficult to overcome.

Building new habits, committing to change and altering one's lifestyle is not easy. And for many, it is too difficult to overcome and they succumb to their psychological addiction and begin anew. It is for this reason that people must quit several times before they succeed. The comfort and familiarity of their addiction is hard to surrender, they have to want something new, to change, to be different than they once were in order to succeed.

The Red Pill is no different.

#Red Pill Truths Are not the Cure
Any man who has climbed out of the pits of beta-dom via the knowledge of TRP can affirmatively state the difficulty of having to change their mindset, accept reality as it is, and take steps into a new world. Many fall back into the allure of their past, the simplicity, the safety of the familiar, only to be faced with the truth again, and again and again. Some say that TRP is wrong, or that parts of it are, or tell themselves any manner of lies in order to reconcile the extreme cognitive dissonance- each of which is an excuse to justify their addiction to their past life.

It is an addiction, and TRP is not the cure, but the world to someone who is not addicted. Hedonism and external validation are potent drugs to the mind. Talk to someone who is struggling with addiction or is in denial about their addiction and the problems it causes for them. What excuses do they provide? How do they defend their choices? How do they deny the truth? Some may attack or belittle you, some may even get worse.

People who are plugged in react in much the same way. They deny it, they call you names, they may get violent. The truth doesn't set them free, it only shows them the truth about themselves, a harsh reflection unencumbered by their conditioning. And like many a story involving such a mirror, seeing themselves so nakedly, it is mind-shattering. To be set free, they must choose freedom and pursue it. Much like an addict who successfully breaks their addiction. They admitted they had a problem, and chose, deliberately, to be better than they were.

The Red Pill is difficult because it is choosing to break the addictions you have comfortably settled into. The truth isn't hard, it's just the truth. Accepting that you have a problem and taking the steps to rid yourself of it, that is hard. Your hedonistic lifestyle and incessant denial that ""you are good enough"" is comforting when the alternative is facing the fact that you are not.

#Accept It
Like all addicts, if you are addicted, you will undoubtedly face the choice to be more than you are more than once. It is up to you and you alone to take it and pursue improvement like you never have before. And I know you never have before, because if you had, you wouldn't be here now.

Stare at the stark reality of your failure. Understand that you are responsible for it. Accept that you can stay where you are, or, accept that you have the power to choose, to choose something different.

The world awaits those who make the right choice. I think you know what to do.",7,1
Do Yourself a Favor in 2021,"**Your Present Self.**

There is a guy. He is either fit or fat, he is educated or uneducated, he is healthy or unhealthy, he has good relationships or bad relationships, and whether he is destitute or prosperous . This guy is you in the future, and you get to decide almost everything about him. Literally a create character screen, every slider, every toggle up or down, on or off, depending on what you choose. Do that character a favor and give him the athletic build, make his job engineer or doctor, make him a single heterosexual male. You get to choose all these things for him, he is you, in the future. Take ten seconds and visualize your current self transforming into the person you want to be in ‚Äúx‚Äù years. Know that it requires consistency but other than that it is quite easy to become that man you have visualized.

**Education and Skill Building.**

Education, knowledge is easy, it's all online, for free. You need a degree? Go to a self paced online college that is regionally and nationally accredited, work your ass off and get that worthless resume checkbox. If you're smart or have the means, go to a top tier college. Work in your free time to build valuable skills that allow you to choose where you live and how much you make, what kind of environment you work in, that degree won't get you a job, but real skills will. Invest in Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, take advantage of the fact that Harvard and MIT have entire degrees online for free if you just need the knowledge. Ask people with experience and create a roadmap that contains all of the industry's best tips and tricks so that you avoid the pitfalls that others have already gone through. Read books that are written by subject matter experts in fields you are interested in so that you are not naive and uneducated and annoying to converse with because of your ineptitude and willful ignorance. Spend lavishly on your education and skill set both in time and effort.

**Physicality.**

Physique and athletic prowess are often intertwined. Spend an hour a day making your body better. Lifting weights, BJJ, Yoga, and Muay Thai. All of these things will give a good return in matters of health, both physically and mentally. Eat a clean diet that is vegetable based without a bunch of stupid shit in it. Focus on heavy compound lifts in the sweet spot where you are simultaneously gaining myofibrillar hypertrophy and sarcoplasmic hypertrophy at the same time. Use a form of linear progression to ensure you are continually improving. Focus on Yoga for the healing of the mind and body. Use BJJ as a mental game to practice your ability to outwit and out maneuver  your opponent in a mock game of life or death. Muay Thai will hone your ability to effectively and quickly produce violent force should the need arise, this will lend to confidence and a healthy ego. All of these together will make for a physique and athletic prowess that will garner respect and envy.

**Career and Wealth.**

Your career is inconsequential unless you are doing something that you love and are passionate about. The real metric used to evaluate a career is how much resources you can derive from it for the amount of time you are willing to dedicate to it. Most wealth that is not inherited is built from being an entrepreneur by creating your own company or the excess from your paychecks that is invested wisely. So first and foremost, if you can make a living in something you are passionate about or love, do so. Otherwise find the highest paying job that does not ruin the other parts of your life. Invest wisely for short term and long term growth; do not be afraid to swing for home runs while you are young, but do not be the fool who is so easily separated from his money. Should you find yourself unhappy or spinning your wheels then it is time to reinvent yourself and move on with the experience that you have gained and to create a more valuable skill set that will allow you to go to where you have visualized you want to be.

**Those Around You.**

While in this process and throughout life surround yourself with the people who are on the same journey and who fill you with good. Never be the king of the losers to feed your ego as you try to better yourself, they will drag you down with them to the pits of failure and mediocrity, which is no place for a man who knows where he is going. Women are a side effect of success in all of these areas.

Take the time to create an in depth map that leads you to this person, create goals and consistent habits that will get you to where you want to be. It is a new year and the world is yours for the taking. The only one holding you back is you.",79,1
Ranting: Why do women have to be the only ones that can kids on their own with sperm donors!!??,"Every time that I open an online dating app, I want to smash my phone into pieces. They sound so freaking retarded, weird and libertine. The women in these apps are so fucking stupid.

Most of them believe in fucking Astrology and magic crystals, things that have been discredited for hundreds of years. Most of them are bisexual which I find disgusting ü§Æ (I don‚Äôt have anything against gay men or women, it‚Äôs the trend of bisexual women that gets to me).

They have a million tattoos and think that is a personality. They have nose piercings which I find disgusting. They are party animals, I believe to the expense of their daddys or simps.

Who has money to be constantly traveling or going on road trips? There is something called student loans and saving...

They are adrenaline junkies that want to YOLO extremely hard. I am not into extreme stuff at all, but women seem to be obsessed with near death experiences. I don‚Äôt want to jump from a plane or fight bears in Russia ...

They think that lame jokes and obscure actors references and boy band references are funny.

They have idiotic requirements that sound to me like they want their partner to be a clone of themselves or to read their minds. And, they want a partner to caters their every need.

Most of them have bachelors degrees and even graduate degrees. You might think that would make them be more professional, moral and genuine in their bios, but no, they still act like horny 5 year olds.

I usually agree with policies and measures taken by the left, aka help poor people and equality for everyone. But, when I see that these girls call themselves leftist, I just want whatever sect of the left that they from to be burned to the ground. They are not even ‚Äúliberal‚Äù. They are more libertine.

I think that people like them will just rot society to the core.

The only ones that have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù bio are the landwales. Otherwise, if the girl has one tiny spec of beauty on her. You will see her to have slut pictures and none sense catch phrases.

I am not religious at all, but I guess that only church women might be the okeish ones because they are afraid of divine punishment?

If not, that only leaves two options, either lower your standards to a fault and be miserable with a bitch just so you get to reproduce (even if you don‚Äôt get to raise the kids) or just let your genes perish and go your own way.

The answers to your questions are **You took the red pill, You decided to self improve, and YOU CAN NEVER GO BACK**.

Becoming a Better Man: Reconciling TRP with an Enlightened World View,"I like to imagine that most TRP members are socially moderate people.

That is, we can see the irony on both sides of the social spectrum, from the ‚Äúwhite knight billy beta blue pill SJW phaggot cuckolds‚Äù to the casual racism, sexism, and homophobia of others. Often times these two categories are not mutually exclusive. Anyone can be racist, and, as we are all well aware, *anyone* can be beta.

Ok. So why the fuck should you care?

TRP is fundamentally a self improvement sub. Many of us came for the women but stayed for everything else this community has to offer. It is a sub that encourages individuality and personal responsibility. We are the best the ‚Äúmanosphere‚Äù has to offer. We didn‚Äôt become incels, didn‚Äôt whine and pout and ‚Äúgo our own way,‚Äù and didn‚Äôt look for easy shortcuts like pickup lines or BS like that. 

We became better men. Physically, mentally, and emotionally. Whether I have 50 plates with a full cutlery set to match or a dick drier than the Sahara desert doesn‚Äôt change the fact that *I am a better man than I was last year*.

We have become the bigger person. The big brother. We don‚Äôt let anyone fuck with us and we don‚Äôt fuck with anyone. We gently prod those around us in the right direction, with full understanding of their struggles and the pure happenstance that saw us overcome ours. 

In this sub we have men from all walks of life. Rich and poor, foreign and American, black and white. All fighting the same battle against impressive odds. And some are winning. Some are so far down this path that RP fundamentals are no longer alien commandments but facts of life so concrete that it has become hard to understand our BP brothers. Where women can no longer be blamed for their choices and the whiny voices of pathetic men that once resonated with us are now repulsive. 

So what can be said for those who look down upon and resent others based on meaningless distinctions like race? Or class, sex, politics, economics, *you name it*. Are these the attitudes of a man in control? Of an *individual* who will *get his no matter what*? Or of a weak man, who blames his obesity on his ‚Äúbig bones,‚Äù or his lack of sex on women, or his failure in life on depression, anxiety, or any of the other excuses popular in 2021.

We all know those excuses are bullshit because we are all human and have felt that way at some point. We are all fighting the same battles on slightly different battlefields.

Believe me, I understand what it‚Äôs like to resent other races. To resent women. To resent people who *have it* better or people who *got it better*. To resent the ‚Äúother‚Äù. I get it.

But being a better man means *understanding that the game is faulty. The game is fucked up in every way imaginable. But playing it anyways. And winning*. 

And then we can make a victory lap and try to change the rules a bit.

#TLDR
Racism, misogyny, etc. Are beta AF. We all know they‚Äôre here. We also all know that it‚Äôs not in the message of this sub but in some of its messengers. I understand and won‚Äôt judge or condemn those who feel that way but I PERSONALLY BELIEVE that one can find the sweet spot between individuality and humanism.

"As much as we try to keep The Red Pill exclusively about sexual strategy, like it or not, we have to accept that our movement has political implications.","Capitalism, communism, anarchism and all of the other ""isms"" usually come with a pre-loaded set of assumptions. The Red Pill, like many of the ""isms"" comes loaded with a set of ideas that continues to enrage and threaten many who have not subscribed to its dogma. Like the adversarial ideas of capitalism and communism, many see the RP ideology as totally incompatible with modern society. The ""liberated"" female has traded her domestic master for a corporate master and those who threaten her newfound freedom must be silenced; or in our case, quarantined. 

On the surface, The Red Pill is a social movement. But I cannot continue to deny its implications in the political sense given how political movements take on more social values and worry less (publicly) about economic or governance issues. 

So who does The Red Pill align with politically? 

1. A case for communism: While many in America align communism with liberalism (thanks Fox News), in the vast majority of cases, that is totally false. Take for example North Korea, where homosexuality is illegal and anyone caught producing pornography or selling drugs is executed. Same can be said of China, the former SU, Laos etc..  In my view, The Red Pill philosophy aligns itself with communism because it espouses order, compliance and hard-line social conservatism. Communist societies have generally been male-centric. While women were allegedly ""equal"" communist dogma, in practice men were allowed to be men and women were allowed to be women. Hence why I see so many western men sing praises for Eastern European women, their femininity and their drive to become mothers. 

2. A case for capitalism: Freedom is something that men cherish. It's part of our DNA and part of our egos hate it when we are dictated what to do, what to think or what to feel. Subsequently, religious institutions (permitted under capitalism) give us societal anchors for conservatism. As men, we also want to improve and have the ability to grow rich and prosperous. A capitalist society is also one where we could more likely have a harem of women because women respond to riches and influence. In a capitalist society, this Red Pill value (accumulating power, money etc) is nurtured. 

3. A case against communism: a delusional and uninformed view of human equality gives women the tools they need to push for more privileged. Females are considered as capable as men and thus skews natural biological norms. 

4. A case against capitalism: the freedom of capitalism has demonstrated the slippery slope of granting freedoms to those who abuse it. The modern woman thinks in terms of money and pleasures (all capitalist ideals) and peruses the easiest routes to get there. In our age, it means becoming a pornstar or a onlyfans girl or a cam girl. 


These are just examples, but the point holds. The Red Pill philosophy has political implications and I'm hoping to hash out which political ideology our Red Pill community aligns itself with the most. I don't care about politics as much as I care about The Red Pill and what its given me in life. Subsequently, I will throw my support to any political ideology that supports The Red Pill and the good things that its done for so many men. 

I would love to hear what you guys think about which political ideology TRP aligns with the most.",8,1

Do you think that, by virtue of being born into a family of older half siblings, the newborn is, dominated socially? I would take a guess that, this is the case, more often than not. The water flows in the path of least resistance. So, just by having a child with a woman whose had a child or children by previous relations, are you systematically reducing your own heirs privilege? Are you systematically ensuring your own heir is more soft spoken, more acutely self conscious or neurotic? The word ‚Äúcuckold‚Äù has been tossed around the manosphere before.... but what about your child? Are you cuckolding your own first born son, by resorting to having a child with a woman whose already known birth by prior relations?",22,1
Slave Morality and Herd Morality: The Two Mental Flaws Holding Beta Males Back From Gaining Muscle,"
Let's cut right to the point. Everyone here knows why beta males can't get laid. Their spineless groveling has them failing Shit Tests harder than Jerome failing Algebra II. This is Red Pill 101. Everyone here also understands why beta males fail at business. Nobody feels good about promoting a tepid coward into a position of leadership. Risk is by definition not something beta males do well with, which precludes them from entrepreneurship. All of this has been covered in depth and at length by the esteemed scholars of the prestigious publication we call The Red Pill.

 

Today alpha genius supreme GayLubeOil shalt pioneer a topic that has yet to be discussed by The Red Pill, bodybuilding forums or muscle magazines: Why It's Impossible for Betas to Get Jacked. Now at first this may seem counterintuitive. Bodybuilding is a relatively asocial activity that consists of lifting weights, stuffing dry chicken breast down your face, sending Bitcoin to Moldova and sleeping a lot. You would assume that a beta male would be able to consistently accomplish these relatively asocial tasks and that his handicap would not be a factor. But that's where you would be wrong. Years of bulking up beta males into muscle bros has taught me that, while eating dry chicken breast is an asocial activity, getting your girlfriend/wife/boss/co-workers/friends to fuck off so you can eat 5 meals a day requires a level of assertiveness most betas don't have. We live in a contingent life world that won't let its beta males have anything nice or rise in social status without a fight. 

 

In order to dig deeper into the details of beta male self-sabotage we need to understand the beta male mindset. The two psychological tendencies that define beta males are ‚Äúfeelings of inferiority‚Äù and ‚Äúoversocialization‚Äù. Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of beta males as a whole, while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of the beta male population.

 

Beta males define themselves via their feelings of inferiority, low self-esteem, powerlessness, depressive tendencies, sickness, defeatism, guilt, self-hatred. Beta males love the idea that they are sick. They love being able to pretend they have a chronic illness or a mental disorder of some kind. Empathy Farming is their favorite sport as it gives a ""get out of life free"" pass, where they can wallow in their despair comfortably at no fault of their own, pretending to be a victim of circumstance. Head over to askTRP and see for yourself.

 

One of the principal challenges in getting a beta male to improve is their emotional investment in losing. Beta males love self-improvement books as they provide something new to try and fail at. The beta male is emotionally invested in not trying or half-ass trying in order to lose and thereby reaffirm his self-image. Beta males spend a lot of their time hating anything that is strong, good or successful. Beta male [Slave Morality](https://youtu.be/I8pKyHW6ZVo) is built on resentment. The beta resents the Alpha and the system of values that the Alpha embodies‚Äîbravery, strength, and confidence. He then decides to adopt a system of morality that values weakness, kindness, and emotional sensitivity. Those who follow his new system are considered moral, just, and kind. Those who don‚Äôt follow it are Shitlord Raysiss Chuds.

 

Because of these ego investments dragging a beta out of his self-deprecating cuck shack towards strength and success always produces a painful identity crisis. Losing is a core part of the beta male identity to the point that they don't know who they are without it. That's why askTRP has been and always will be swamped with ""taking the Red Pill"" identity crises. There's a famous Anti Red Pill post written years ago called the Red Pill Will Kill You Inside. Look it up. Essentially, it's about a beta male having an existential crisis after being pulled out of his cuck shack and crying as he desperately crawls back in.

 

Now that we have a firm grasp of the beta male inferiority complex‚Äîaka Slave Morality‚Äîit's important that we understand the other piece of the puzzle: Oversocialization‚Äîaka [Herd Morality](https://youtu.be/_kDRkW0N7uw). Socialization is the process by which media, school and parents teach children to think and act as society demands. A person is said to be well-socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning member. Since we live in a Neoliberal society where Big Capital is the arbiter of morality, good is defined as being a compliant wagie consoomer who makes his boss a lot of money, has a mortgage and doesn't think forbidden conspiracy theory thoughts.

 

The problem arises when the beta male has antisocial thoughts such as revenge for perceived slights, envy of the strong, and the desire for self-aggrandizement. His oversocialization prevents him from taking what he desires without paying heed to the moral order of the day. He must launder his desires through the hegemonic system of values. His Alpha coworker always seems to do well with the ladies and has a seemingly limitless supply of confidence, so the beta spreads a rumor among his coworkers that the Alpha made rude and sexist remarks about women. What is more, the beta believes that he has done the right thing by exposing a misogynous oppressor. This action appears radical to the beta, but in reality, it is completely in accordance with social norms. Direct conflict intimidates him, so he weasels his way through life in order to get what he wants. Another name for this creature is the [Bugman](https://www.meta-nomad.net/bugmen-what-are-they/). Actions from others that truly threaten the hegemonic system of values will be shot down by the beta male through his own feelings of inferiority and envy of the strong.

 

A beta male can't get jacked for the same reason they are unable to succeed at pretty much anything: Slave Morality. Progressive overload aka progressively challenging the body more with more sets/reps/volume/intensity is the most fundamental principle of bodybuilding. A beta male stricken by powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, isn't going to progressively lift more week after week. Instead, he'll show up to the gym, do the bare minimum and mope home. Unfortunately for the beta male, the body doesn't grow from the bare minimum, it only adapts at the limits of its capacity. Slave Morality beta males can't push limits which is why they can't gain muscle mass.

 

The beta male supplicating conformism aka Herd Morality is the other obstacle preventing him from putting on muscle mass. The world is filled with losers, Bloopies and NPCs who only feel comfortable when everyone else remains at their level. Bodybuilding is usually thought of as an individual activity. This is false. Bodybuilding is a revolt against the modern world that wants nothing more than to rob you of your gainz.

 

Why are your girlfriend and family always complaining about you going to the gym and eating your chicken and rice? Why does your teacher waste your time with endless busywork? Why did your governor close the gyms? Why does Customs and Border Enforcement prevent you from getting your medicine? The answer is that there is a [Gainz Goblin Conspiracy](https://imgur.com/a/Nt6inlN). They don't want you to have 23-inch biceps, boulder shoulders or have the opportunity to do Rich Piana's 8-hour arm workout. Which is why if you are not a Herd Morality beta bitch you will do everything in your power to subvert the Gainz Goblin's evil plans.

 

This brings me to my riveting conclusion. If you want anything of value in this world be it muscular body, passive income or Filipino ""girlfriend"" utilized exclusively for jungle anal, you can't give in to self-doubt and you can't be afraid to push limits. If you want to live an extraordinary life you must avoid the Slave Morality and Herd Morality traps created to prevent you from living your best life. The path of greatness may be long and arduous but I can guarantee that when your 75% Filipino 25% douchebag grandchildren open up their photo album and see how muscular their grandfather was, you will be grateful to yourself for listening to the wise scholars of the prestigious publication we call The Red Pill.

How do I check a disrespectful younger brother with my mom shutting down any confrontations?,"My younger brother 16 and I‚Äôm 18. 

The way we joke around with each other is through insults. My father does the same thing, and I‚Äôm sure this is where we both picked it up. 

I‚Äôm okay with the insults every now and then but, recently they‚Äôve slightly been getting on my nerves. When ever my younger brother gets angry he easily disrespects me because I haven‚Äôt setup that boundary between us. It doesn‚Äôt help when my father does the same thing but, the difference is we both respect our father. 

We don‚Äôt insult him, even for jokes. When we do try to joke around with him, and it gets too excessive he checks us to let us know that he is our father, and not a friend. 

I used to get respect from physically bullying my brother when we were a lot younger but, I‚Äôve changed as we grew up. Although, since I‚Äôve been used to demanding respect through physical means, I feel like nothing is effective without having getting physical. 

I don‚Äôt know how to handle the disrespect from my younger brother, as well as creating a boundary without losing my shit and beating my younger brothers ass. The last time he disrespected me I lost my shit, and slapped the shit out of him. He didn‚Äôt speak to me for  a whole month, and my mom somehow put everything on me saying that when my brother insults me I should just take it and ignore it.  (This was recent but, prior to that I had never laid a single finger on my brother for years. Just to make it clear)

I‚Äôve been doing the whole ignoring  thing for years, and it hasn‚Äôt worked. I‚Äôve only become a walking mat. When I do confront my younger brother every now and then my mom always yells at me for starting the confrontation, and tells me to do the same old shit. ‚ÄúJust grow up and ignore him‚Äù 

Most of the confrontation come from telling him not to curse in the house, and he doesn‚Äôt follow my request which pisses me off.

My ego can‚Äôt handle this. How does one demand respect? The same younger brother also uses my youngest brother as some sort of slave to do shit around the house. As the oldest  I want the 2 to respect each other equally but, how can I go about this? 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts on how to check a women on here but, how does one check a little brother?

Check out relationships for your daily blue pill entertainment (copied text),"My (28M) girlfriend (26F) of two years was selling nudes behind my back.

It was a normal Saturday we spent the day together and we had a good time. We went to the store and on the way home I glanced over at her and saw a Snapchat conversation open with a pic of her butt and the name Chris at the top of the chat. 

My stomach dropped. I asked her who Chris was and why she was sending a booty pic to him. She preceded to get angry with me and say it was one of her patreon subscribers and that I should already know she does stuff like this, but I didn‚Äôt know it was like that. I thought she just posted there, not actually interacting with them. Besides this was Snapchat not patreon. It just feels way more personal. 

Since August she started a patreon of her cosplays, streaming, and some lewds. I‚Äôve helped her with it with taking pictures, editing, setting up her streaming of games and other stuff. When she decided to do it I was told she wasn‚Äôt going to post nudity. I told her i was comfortable with that. 

Tonight after we got back to her house I did something I‚Äôm not proud of. I got on her computer and read through her messages on patreon and discovered a plethora of nudes, videos, and other things she was sending to a bunch of men. I‚Äôm so heart broken. I know it‚Äôs not technically cheating but I didn‚Äôt even get any consideration about it. I‚Äôm very understanding and I probably would have been okay with it if she had told me she wanted to do that. I know I have no say in what she does with her body, I never would try to. But I feel like this is a major lie that I can‚Äôt ignore. I feel completely betrayed and I‚Äôm already insecure. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I confronted her about it and she began to try and gaslight me saying that I should have known that‚Äôs what she was doing and that everyone does it. 2 years of dating and I didn‚Äôt even get a notice. I already am very insecure and have a deep rooted fear of being cheated on because my mother had an affair when I was young and it destroyed my family. Which lead to a drug addiction of which I‚Äôve been clean and sober from for 4 years. 

TL;DR my gf of two years has secretly been selling nudes behind my back. I don‚Äôt know what to do.",176,1
askTRP and the ''Magic Bullets'',"**INTRO**:

I don't care whether you just figured out The Red Pill, going through the anger phase or do you still use Mysterys tricks. Maybe you have 'swallowed' the pill long time ago. The more the time passes by, the more aware I become of some things around me. 

If you check on askTRP now and there, most of the posts focus on things that can be categorised as outergame problems. And that is completely fine. Everyone has right to ask what he wants and get quality answer to improve his life. 

The thing is, most of those outer game questions are not really caused by outer game deficits. Most of, if not all, are caused with feeling of insecurity, lack of frame and having strong bounds of life philosophy.

**BODY**:

I was planning to write an disserations here, but while writinng the intro, the main idea came to my mind.

This is another, 'I have heard it before/We all know that/DeAr GaWd' post.

You can't fix the inner problem with the outer solution in the long term. You can patch it up here and there, but eventually, it will break. And it will be a hard comeback.

You can't camouflage the lack of your life, your boundaries, your frame with a new bench record, gazilion k-closes you have just seen on YT.

You can't camouflage that moment when you want to do X and you still care what is Mary, Anthony or Mark will say. Regardless if it was a brialliant idea. 

You hesitate. And hesistations kills.

I am not saying you won't get girls. You can manipulate them if you are familiar with practical psychology.

What I am saying that you can have it all on the outside, and still have nothing on the inside.

There are no ''Magic Bullets''  that will solve all your problems which you will find on the reddit.

There is only one real, ''Magic Bullet.'

That magic bullet is your head.

**CONCLUSION**:

Next time you are in fear, panicking, what you should write her back, when you should reply, what you should open with, should you hook up with your ex...Next time you are rushing to askTRP to soak the wisdom of the RedBrothers.

Don't come come home when you get roasted by the comment section. Think about what are some of the comments saying.

Think about, why is that 'problem' important to you?

Is it really important?

Will that line, that new trick you have learned solve all your problems?

Think about the core reason why do you have to ask these things.

Think about...

Are you the man who you want to be?

 Or just another fancy trickster who will always stand in the corner watching that guy who 'just have it?'

A lost soul needs counceling,"Hello everyone

  
I'm noticing more and more some patterns with the women surrounding me (20's)  
Mostly they strive for attention and doesn't care for individuality, only the numbers and in the result, makes every man talking to them quite disposable and forgetable  
The thing that made me realise this is firstly that most of the girls i've talked to didn't ""came back"" at me, I always had to be the motor of the conversation and say hello or I would just be alone  
And secondly is that recently, I got added by an ""artsy"" girl to a discord server and it just baffled me  
There's 30+ men for 2 girls, and every dude are super kind with her, are an endless fuel of compliments and reassurance

  
Meanwhile, each time they got the occasion, the girls put down the guys, insult them, are openly bold and uncaring and NEVER returned any compliment in the short time I was in the server.  
Most baffling thing is that they show the thousands of DMs they do everyday with an neverending supply of dudes and it's insane how the dudes are so mistreated and toyed with.  
In a way I feel like they go on with men who has the most value they can give (the most attention, most kindness...) at a particular moment, which means each and everyone of us is in a perpetual competition and if we flinch for 2 seconds the game is lost.  
I've never been really competitive at first and so i've got a few questions :

  
How to battle against this ? How to win in the game of attention and basic human needs if they don't need to bat an eye to have quite everything ?  
What can I read to learn more ?  
What can I do to free myself from this disposable/value-circle ?  
How to find a girl who's out of this loop, if there even one that exists ? One that primes individuality before anything else ?  
Why do we gotta do tons of thing to improve while they doesn't need to ?

Patience is a virtue. Trust the process!,"I have recently turned 25 and I am blessed by God to see 25 years of age especially the circumstances that I have came from.

To start, I do not get any pussy whatsoever. Last year I fucked only 1 girl (I know it's sad). But last year I've lost 45 pounds, I am about to learn how to play the guitar, I  learned to trade stocks and crypto, I am getting to closer to understanding my creator/religion, and got a salaried paying job right after college.

I am not bragging, but I just wanted to tell you fellas that this is not a race it's a fucking marathon. I really cannot wait to see who I will be when I turn 30. I want to see that fucking compound interest everyone is talking about when you invest so early, or myself moving from a cubicle to an office space, or better yet, my name in Forbes magazine at 40. Oh and of course, I cannot wait to see all the of the 20 year old women these couples are abundantly making for me. 

Crazy, because last year I wanted to kill myself, and I am not lying!

I am still going through my lazy episode because I'm not dedicated and have no discipline. But I figured how to fix that because I promised my self this year, I would either learn how to box or fight in the arts of jiu-jitsu.

I just want you guys to know that PATIENCE is  key and I will be a hypocrite to tell that I love patience (I fucking hate it). But, unfortunately we have to go through this long route because some of us are former BETA males! So we have to chisel out our problems, so that when we reach our final destination, it would look like To others that it came naturally.

And guess who will be waiting for us at the finish line trying to touch your hard earned money, fame, success and body. To the point where  you say to yourself, ""bitch do you know how hard it took me to get to this point!"" 

And then you actually tell her,

""Do not touch my shit and get to what you do best to make me happy.""

I just want everyone to keep grinding and get to your fucking dream and purpose so you can enjoy life. Have your mortgage bill and the BMW car payment set to auto pay, because you have the funds for it.

Most importantly have some fucking fun with your bros and brag about the fun you're having. Remember no one likes a boring dude and life is very limited!

"A tale of woe. Also, some advice please","As with these things, it's kind of hard to write. Not because it's difficult to put into words what's happening, but because it's hard to herd all the seeming complexities together.

Anyway I've been seeing this chick for almost a year. I suppose I should make a /deadbedrooms post to give you some idea. I think she's a fun character and all but our relationship is toxic and I want out.

Here's the problem: our assets are so god damn intertwined and if I were to get out, she'd be out on her ass and I can't have that. So I worked out an idea that I'll hook her up for 6 months or so and then ""we'll see how our relationship works out.""

I know what you're all thinking now: simp, beta, whatever - but, she did carry me through the pandemic financially when I was laid off. I'm getting paid handsomely now such that I can afford to carry her a little bit but the original setup was that she would go to med school (2 years). I'm now realizing maybe 1500/mo for 2 years isn't such a good idea (i make about 150k with an upper limit of 250 and maybe more if I make it google or Stripe or something). Some people don't even make that. 

It felt unfair. Why? Because we started having minor squabbles over shit and it's just fucking soul draining. 

A buddy of mine suggested I pack the shit I own (as much of it as I can) into a car and leave my very nice apt that's about to run out of a lease and go to Nevada, abandoning all.

I just turned 30 and I'm petrified at the prospect of dating. Clearly, wasn't great at it before. With covid, don't even know what that means anymore.

Anyway, tl;dr, stuck with a person I am no longer in love with and having serious fiscal responsibilities as well as co-mingled assets. We're not married and have no kids so that helps.

Filling the Void,"**Tl;Dr:**

The primordial void has always needed filling. Fill yours wisely.

**Body:**

From the dawn of man to us right now there has been one constant war, survival. Once those needs have been met; then what?

We won't argue about how much free time the hunter and gatherers had versus agricultural societies versus post industrial revolutionists. The facts stand, all these societies, including ours do not require 24/7 investment from it's citizens to survive. We're not talking thriving, simply what it takes to survive.

Realistically you can survive on a forty hour a week, minimum wage job anywhere in the United States of America. Ideal living situation, no. With that you should be able afford a room, hopefully without an actual roommate, in a house with strangers and food. You should be sleeping eight hours a night, that's fifty-six hours a week, leaving your week with seventytwo hours. I dare you to fill them productively. I'll  even help you cut some hours off.

Five hours a week, that's thirty minutes of drive time each way. Take another hour a day for food. Heck take thirty minutes to unwind at night and get ready in the morning. That's a sloppy nineteen leaving you with fiftythree hours each week to use or kill.

Killing it is exactly how most people spend it. Look at how much of society is geared around spending money in exchange for *a good time.* A lot of that *good time* that's being pedaled for you, isn't  necessarily the best for you. I'm not going to tell anyone to stop going to the bars, binge watching series, reading frivolous books, playing video games, doing puzzles or simply sitting around smoking weed listening to music. Just don't come at me with an excuse about time if you don't have every single second of your week planned out; with all the garbage time wasters cut.

Most of you would be surprised at how much free time you actually have to fill day to day. My advice, move from spending your time as a consumer, to a producer, improving your most important product: you. 

*In conclusion:*

7 days a week, 24 hours a day, 60 minutes an hour, 60 seconds a minute or 604,800 seconds a week. By no means are you suppose to have ever second of your life planned out but by mapping out what has to get done, you can take control what's left, spending it on what you want or squandering your time like it's going out of style.",15,1
Hi,[removed],0,1
Appreciations &amp; Ruminations following my Red Pill Journey (Part 2/3),"In my previous post, I touched upon my validation-seeking patterns and noted that the underlying reason why was because I couldn‚Äôt face the implications of not being able to live up to other people‚Äôs expectations. In my case, at a young age, I understood failure as ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt deserve love and may be outcasted‚Äù. I also never took the time to overwrite that definition with a healthier one until post-TRP.

How a person defines failure will differ depending on many factors, such as the environment they grew up in or their upbringing. Failure is thus a subjective experience.

But the process that took me from the unhealthy definition of ‚Äúfailure‚Äù to a better one was a long and painful one. I will explain why shortly. The next section focuses on what I believe to be one of the most difficult parts of my journey: internalizing a concept.

## #2: Perception changes vs. Internalization

**Journey highlight #2:** The phase of my life where I cemented my blue pill beliefs into my identity was in high school, so roughly between 2010 and 2016.

During that period, I learned all about respecting women, putting them on pedestals, and showering them with attention as a proper strategy to win their affection. I also noticed how the more popular bad boys who often broke the rules were the ones hanging out with the hottest girls in our grade. But girls would also often complain about them. My understanding at the time was either to ‚ÄúBeat em or join em.‚Äù But I didn‚Äôt want to join them, so I wanted to beat them by showing that I was different.

In the attempt to tell myself that they were wrong and that I was right, I doubled down on my beliefs and reinforced them by conversing with other people on what girls wanted and by shooting my shot at the under-the-radar pretty girls. Retrospectively, those were subconscious ego-protective actions that served to hold my fragile identity together, but of course, I had no idea.

Unsurprisingly, I rarely had any sexual experiences: I got LJBFed by my high school oneitis and served as an emotional tampon for several other girls I had crushes for, none of them amounting to anything more.

After high school, I started feeling pressured to pop my cherry. But while I wanted to know how the bad boys did it, I didn‚Äôt want to associate myself with them in any way. My ego was continuing to protect me. For the next two years thus, I sunk even deeper into my beliefs and tried dating 4 more romantic prospects using my same strategy, all which ended in shambles.

So while I was doing well in other parts of my life, the lack of pussy was weighing me down like Jupiter‚Äôs gravity. I felt hopeless in that area and had no idea what to correct.

Cue 2018: I discover this sub.

Through frequenting TRP, I went through the biggest **perception** change in my life. AWALT, the wall, plate theory, all that. I brushed through it all with full agreement from the get-go. I was offered something I have longed to discover for a long time, but never found until that day: a completely different way of seeing intersexual dynamics. I also had the comfort to do so in complete anonymity. I thus started reading TRP recommended literature, lifted, and practiced meditation.

But even though I agreed with most of the theory, I still had a hard time **internalizing** the concepts. Not the step-by-step guides like texting and lifting, but stuff like DGAF and abundance mentality. Back then, I thought it‚Äôd take me at most a few months to get it.

However, it‚Äôs been two years ever since I discovered those, and I sometimes still fall into the trap of operating with an outcome dependent, scarce mindset. But in my quest to try and internalize those concepts, I found out why despite going through huge amounts of perception changes, internalization is actually much, much harder than originally anticipated.

**Pitfall #2:** Due to my lack of awareness in high school, I didn‚Äôt know that I was reinforcing an unhealthy and inefficient belief system. How could I know any better? Given the limited set of knowledge and tools I had at the time, I was sort of destined to fall deeper into that trench. So for 8 years, I cemented those blue pill tendencies into my identity without ever considering how faulty those beliefs were.

**Reflection #2:** We like to learn. Learning is the antidote to boredom: it creates the novelty we need in order to feel challenged. And a lot of us love overcoming a good challenge because it‚Äôs a display of strength. A fun learning process is a good balance between familiarity and novelty.

The same, however, cannot be said with learning new belief systems. The reason why is because learning a new belief system **also means to unlearn the old one that comes in contradiction.**

For example, for the longest time, I believed that being attentive and caring to a woman would help me win her affection (idea A). I thus couldn‚Äôt fathom that doing the opposite (idea B) would yield me the same results. Both these ideas cannot co-exist *without challenging my understanding of logic*: it‚Äôs either one or the other. So, in order to welcome idea B, I must reject idea A, aka, I must unlearn it.

The problem is that it has taken me a whopping 8 years to cement idea A into my world views. Idea A has also been reinforced by countless instances of conversation and action that I cannot possibly recount in full.

So as much as my perception has been changed about a topic, having that identity shift would take much more effort than simply just wishing for it, because it requires me to also unlearn all the default interpretations and social cues that cannot co-exist with that new idea. I can‚Äôt just simply stack that on top of all my other knowledges like biology, math, etc. I need to slowly peel off a part of myself and somehow fit the new belief into that spot, hoping it can squeeze in.

Belief systems also tend to overlap with others as well. For example, my understanding of ‚Äúrespecting women‚Äù was somewhat tied to ‚Äúgender equality.‚Äù Rewriting what I knew about ‚Äúrespecting women‚Äù thus also requires shifting to an identity that can fill all those secondary missing gaps created in my ‚Äúgender equality‚Äù beliefs as well.

*Basically, the internalization of beliefs is a time-consuming process where one does a delicate makeover of oneself while trying not to have their own understanding of other notions crumble.* 

And that‚Äôs hard as fuck.

And if it took me 8 years to cement that faulty idea, it should arguably take me as much effort and time to 100% eradicate that belief from my subconscious. Ideally, I‚Äôd love to learn it asap, but I have to recognize that the process isn‚Äôt as straightforward as I was led to believe. As always though, YMMV.

**Conclusion &amp; solution #2:** (1) Your age, (2) the frequency you‚Äôve reinforced a belief you now want to shed, (3) your social environment, (4) how strongly your ego is protecting you, among other factors, may significantly make the process more difficult than to ‚Äújust internalize it bro‚Äù. Mindset shifts like these require as much learning as it requires unlearning, whatever that might be for you. **Internalizing new beliefs should thus be a personal goal that requires as much time as you need, not some objective timeframe meant for a one-size-fit-all.**

It doesn‚Äôt help that, given the timespan of most movies, we are regularly shown that mumbling a few serious words to the MC = internalizing some lesson and leading to a big win. Because the process will rarely be that simple. A makeover of oneself, especially one that has a strong foundation, requires action with feedback, thought-process tracking, and time.

In my experience, internalization was a slow and often painful grind because the change does not come overnight (unless I go through a traumatic experience). I think of it more as coming up with a brand-new theory: I have a main idea (perception change) and need to constantly test its validity in the real world in order to understand how to calibrate it around newly discovered inconsistencies.

In the context of replacing BP with TRP, I must basically live experiences that rewrite the old narrative with new interpretations. And due to the sheer unfamiliarity and unpredictability of the ordeal, the first couple of times tend to hurt the most. Because that's when the open wound is the freshest.

Sometimes, my ‚Äúold self‚Äù would come back too. Those are instances where my blue-pilled self decides to resurface. Where I suddenly catch myself attaching part of my self-worth to the outcome. I would subsequently heavily self-critique myself for what I believed meant that no progress was made. But I discovered more and more that **occasional blue reappearances are normal**. Relapses can happen. Identity shifts are a gradual change. As long as I count my wins rather than my losses, I learn to rely more and more on myself and am able to keep truckin‚Äô on.

\*\*\*

Now that the concept internalization has been explained, there is one crucial point that‚Äôs missing: before I internalize concepts, I have to have a good idea why I would want to go through such a makeover in the first place. Which brings me to the 3rd part.

How to fuck girls who have boyfriends - The 4 factors,"If you are aware of the 4 factors you can fuck a girl with a boyfriend/husband. Moralize if you want, idc

If you are the boyfriend/husband yourself, be mindful of the 4 factors to avoid getting cheated on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Factor 1 - The slutty friend who promotes it**

Her friend keeps shit talking her boyfriend. ""Oh my god he's so trash you should just break up with him you can do so much better girl blah blah blah""

You can bet this slutty friend has a huge impact in reducing your target girls ASD for the night. Your target girl will likely defend her boyfriends status or seem pretty upset at what her slutty friend is suggesting but deep down she's excited at the possibility to hear ""YOU GO GIRL"" from the slutty friend after the night is over.

&amp;#x200B;

*How to utilize this to fuck the girl:* 

Listen out for her friends shit talking her boyfriend. DO NOT do any of the shit talking yourself. Don't even seem interested in her boyfriend. Just listen out for this sign and know the game is on.

&amp;#x200B;

*How to defend yourself against this factor:* 

Know your girlfriends female friends. They will be all cute and nice to you when you are there but will likely shit talk you behind your back the moment you do something that they take as a personal insult because the slutty friend has been dumped, feeling lonely etc.

If your girl has slutty friends then you have a poor vetting system. Back to reading Humansockpuppets posts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Factor 2 - Alcohol and other drugs + Party environment**

'Party' drugs skyrocket sluttiness and open up the situation to begin with. It's very unlikely that she will cheat completely sober. But throw in a couple of drinks or some weed and that slutty party 'girls just wanna have fun' side comes out. It goes down in house parties, nightclubs, smoke sessions. Pretty much anything after dark when substances are involved.

&amp;#x200B;

*How to utilize this to fuck the girl:* 

Always have some drinks in your apartment. Fuck your diet son 2 drinks will not harm your fitness progress unless you're eating junk food throughout the week anyway. Either invite her for a couple of cocktails but if she wants to cheat she will invite you.

&amp;#x200B;

*How to defend yourself against this factor:* 

Your stoner girl is cheating with the guys she smokes with. Your girl is acting like a dumb party slut when she goes out drinking with the girls. If your girl takes any drug more than once a month and especially if she puts herself in that party/nightclub environment, she isn't your girl. She's our girl. Again, poor vetting process. You can't tame this type of girl. The sooner you walk away the better.

&amp;#x200B;

**Factor 3 - Angry/upset at boyfriend**

Her boyfriend hasn't text her all day! You're in champ.

This includes if her boyfriend has decreased his value by doing some stupid shit like opening up and talking about his feelings. This is the modern days greatest shit test (journal or talk to your boys about your emotional side, not your girl idiot).

&amp;#x200B;

*How to utilize this to fuck the girl:* 

Briefly speak about why she's upset at him ""What he do girl??"" and then shut up. Her brain will connect the dots that's she's dissatisfied by her bf and you could be a potential replacement even just for the night. Monkey's love swinging on those branches.

&amp;#x200B;

*How to defend yourself against this factor:* 

We could tell you to never do anything that upsets her but then you wouldn't do anything at all, and even that would upset her lol.

Even if you act like the iconic red pill alpha male big chad thundercock, she'll have constant moments of annoyance at you. For example when you dread game her, when you're busy on your purpose etc.

You can't stop her feeling like this. Relearn about AWALT and understand the glass was already broken anyway. Have your enjoyment when there's enjoyment to be had and the moment you are aware (or you have the gut feeling) that she will cheat, walk away with gratitude for the experiences you had together.

&amp;#x200B;

**Factor 4 - When she knows you won't talk**

**Read the post on my profile ""Learn to shut the hell up. Never talk about your sexual experiences, even when asked""**

Some idiots in the comments of that post thought the Iron Rules of Tomassi did not apply to them. Those are the boys who won't get to fuck the girls with boyfriends.

For a girl to cheat on her boyfriend she has to believe you won't go blabbing about what happened. Never speak about your sexual experiences, always keep it a mystery. All girls act like they are annoyed at this but that is a common shit test, they actually deeply respect a guy who doesn't talk about his sexual life because that means he won't talk about her, so it's their little secret.

&amp;#x200B;

*How to utilize this to fuck the girl:*

Shut the hell up. You aren't the exemption from this rule retard, unless you enjoy not getting laid.

&amp;#x200B;

*How to defend yourself against this factor:*

If your girl somehow believes you'll find out, she's far less likely to cheat. She's still a cheater at heart  of course but when she believes her actions will have consequences (which is very rarely) she will behave right.

If you have a vibrant social circle that both you and your girl are a part of, you must be the highest value person in there which would mean that anyone who finds out your girl has cheated would tell you. Even then it can be swept under the rug.

How to deal with Sexual Apathy (aka ‚ÄúBanging New Girls Just isn‚Äôt Fulfilling Anymore‚Äù),"If you‚Äôre pretty confident when it comes to getting sex and feel like you‚Äôve achieved most of your goals with women, you‚Äôve probably asked yourself this question: *Is sleeping with new girls always going to satisfy me?*

I see a tonne of guys go through the process of learning to get laid, working on themselves and making massive improvements which eventually result in them getting plenty of girls. They get to a point where sex comes fairly easily to them &amp; is no longer a challenge ‚Äì which sounds like a dream come true (and in many ways, of course it is). But they all inevitably hit the same roadblock: ‚ÄúGetting laid is becoming boring; it doesn‚Äôt satisfy me like it used to. *I don‚Äôt feel fulfilled any more.‚Äù*

I ran into this problem myself [when I really started getting laid](https://killyourinnerloser.com/proof/), but I quickly figured out the problem. **Guys get bored of sex because they‚Äôve stopped improving.**

We‚Äôre not having sex just to have sex. Part of the appeal of getting laid is it‚Äôs a mission, a goal, something to work towards. Guys love missions, we love having the pull of an awesome, life-changing goal to give us direction. It‚Äôs the process of working on your goals that gives you a reason to get up every morning and try to be better than you were the day before.

And once we reach those goals, when we finally get to say, ‚ÄúI did it‚Äù, we set new goals. Deadlift 200kg in the gym? Cool, time to work towards a 250kg deadlift. Get a promotion at work? Great, time to work towards eventually running the company (or leaving to go start your own company). Once we reach a goal, the only logical thing to do is set a new goal and keep moving forward.

Yet for some reason, guys forget this when it comes to getting laid. We have this weird notion in our head that, ‚ÄúAs soon as I can get laid a lot, my entire life will be perfect.‚Äù We expect when we reach our goals with girls, all the pieces will fall into place, the stars will align, God himself will reach down to give us a high five ‚Äì life will be perfect.

But: it doesn‚Äôt work that way.

Getting laid is like every other goal ‚Äì it‚Äôs something you achieve, and **then you move on to the next goal.** 

You‚Äôre not supposed to find *Ultimate Satisfaction‚Ñ¢* from getting laid ‚Äì it‚Äôs just one (very important) goal in a long list of goals you‚Äôll work on over your lifetime. Just like being rich won‚Äôt make your life totally complete and finished, getting more pussy won‚Äôt keep fulfilling you forever and ever and ever.

So when you get to the point where sex comes easily and is no longer as fulfilling as it once was, you‚Äôve got two options:

# 1. Start your Next Mission, &amp; Let Sex Become a Fun Hobby You do in Your Spare Time

When you get to the point that banging new girls doesn‚Äôt bring you the euphoria it once did, and you feel like you‚Äôve got your sex life fairly handled, it makes sense to sit down &amp; come up with a new goal to dedicate yourself to. For me, it was starting this website and mentoring other people ‚Äì I want to help you achieve all the cool things I‚Äôve been able to achieve. For you, it might be starting your own business, or working on strength goals, or becoming a blogger, or finding a girlfriend to settle down with and start a family, or travelling around the world, or giving back to your community through philanthropy. Whatever the goal is, give it everything you have and go all-in; close the ‚Äúgetting laid‚Äù chapter of your life and 100% commit to the next chapter.

Some guys choose a girl to go monogamous with, so they‚Äôre getting regular sex, intimacy and companionship, and can therefore focus on their next mission. Other guys have casual relationships/regular fuckbuddies, so they‚Äôre getting hassle-free sex without much drama or effort. Some dudes use Tinder to maintain their sex life ‚Äúin the background‚Äù while their main mission is at the forefront.

If you‚Äôre like me and you still enjoy sex and don‚Äôt ever want to be monogamous, you can find a girlfriend who‚Äôs cool with you sleeping with other girls (preferably one who wants to share them with you). My girl and I have plenty of 3somes together ‚Äì and you can too. Or you could approach 1 girl a day in the street (takes literally 1 minute out of your life) and keep Tinder rolling in the background for easy sex. I‚Äôve created a very efficient sex life for myself so I can concentrate on my other missions.

To make it clear: Even after you‚Äôve had a tonne of girls ‚Äì sex is still fun. It will always be fun. You‚Äôll always enjoy it, always have the drive to do it, and always enjoy female company. It just won‚Äôt always be your number one goal any more ‚Äì it‚Äôll be more like a ‚Äúbackground‚Äù habit.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. Write a Sexual Bucketlist, and Make it your Mission to Explore Everything on it

If you feel like you still want to focus on getting more sex ‚Äì but you‚Äôre frustrated by the fact it hasn‚Äôt been fulfilling you as much as it used to ‚Äì you can sit down and write a sexual bucketlist.

I‚Äôve got a full guide to writing a sexual bucketlist here. The goal of writing a bucketlist is to set yourself the mission to work through as many of the items on the list as you can and tick them all off. It‚Äôll be a fun project for you to work on, you‚Äôll end up with a tonne of hilarious stories to tell your friends, you‚Äôll gain heaps of experience, you‚Äôll meet a variety of different types of women (since in many cases you‚Äôll have to seek out a very specific type of girl to fulfil a particular fantasy). Working through your list will become satisfying in itself ‚Äì not to mention the sex you have will be a hell of a lot more varied and wild. Nothing cures sexual apathy like a massive, exciting list of fun kinks to explore.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Takeaway

Having sex isn‚Äôt supposed to be your end goal; in fact, there‚Äôs no goal that‚Äôll totally complete your life by itself. The day you decide to stop improving yourself is the day you cease to live.

This was never about girls anyway. This was always about making yourself a better man.",27,1

The Complete Guide to Improving Your SMV,"I've been seeing a ton of posts on this sub lately of guys asking if they texting the right thing, passed this shit test properly, said the right thing etc. One of the problems with TRP and the questions asked in this sub is that we don't know what you guys look like. What's your max bench? How's your grooming? Do you dress like a neckbeard or do you have a sense of style? Chances are the girl isn't ghosting you because of what you said or what you texted her - it's because your SMV isn't high enough bro. I'm sick of seeing these posts on ""text game"" and ""social media"". High value males don't use text game. It doesn't exist. High value males have 100 more important things to do than ""ping value into the void"" or send girls memes on instagram. That's what this post is about. No bullshit. Plain and simple, I'm going to cover the basics of improving your SMV. Stop worrying about PUA pickup lines and text game and put more effort into your SMV - the results will speak for themselves. I'm going to break this post down into sections and go into depth on each part. 

# Hair

Hair loss is a reality that the majority of men are going to face one day. That's the bad news. The good news is that it is 2020 and there are a ton of options to deal with it. Don't listen to the ""just shave it bros"" and figure out what works for you. Here's the cookie cutter hair loss stack anyone with hair loss or MPB genetics should get on:

1. Finasteride: Blocks the conversion of testosterone to DHT by inhibiting 5 alpha reductase. This leads to a reduction in scalp and serum DHT levels. Fin is intended to prevent further hair loss and should not be used as a growth agent. Talk to your doctor/derm, tell them you are experiencing hair loss and it should be pretty easy to get a prescription. You can ask to get prescribed Proscar (5 mg fin) and use a pill cutter - this works out cheaper or you can get the 1 mg fin generic with a coupon from GoodRX. Start off taking 1 mg Mon/Wed/Fri and if you don't have sides start using 1 mg everyday. 
2. Minoxidil: Topical growth agent that increases hair growth on the scalp. You can buy a 12-month supply of Kirkland minoxidil on Amazon for around $50 or you can get Rogaine foam if that works better for you (this is more expensive). 
3. Ketoconazole: Nizoral is a 1% ketoconazole shampoo that you can buy OTC at your local drug store. Nizoral is good for clearing off residual minoxidil from the scalp and there are studies that show that ketoconazole increases hair growth. Use it 2-3 times a week, leave it on your scalp for 5 minutes, and rinse it off. 

If finasteride isn't strong enough for your MPB look into Dutasteride - While Fin blocks around 70% of DHT, Dutasteride will nuke your DHT pretty closer to zero. Also look into RU58841 which is a research chemical used for hair loss. I'm going to link some studies supporting the above protocol below: 

Finasteride: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9951956/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9951956/)

Minoxidil: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6691938/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6691938/)

RU58841: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9415227/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9415227/)

Dutasteride: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27549867/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27549867/)

# Skin Care

When I wake up, I wash my face with cold water and put on SPF-70 sunscreen even if I am not leaving the house to prevent UV related skin aging. Here's the protocol I use for skin-care. 

1. Vitamin-C serum: After I workout and shower, I apply topical Vitamin C, while my pours have been opened by the steam from the shower. 
2. SPF-70 Sunscreen: After the Vitamin C serum dries, I apply suncreen on top to prevent UV related skin aging and counteract the increased sensitivity from the topical vitamin C
3. Tretinoin: In the evening, I apply 0.025% Tretinoin to my face. There are numerous studies that show Tretinoin improves collagen production on the skin. Tell your doctor you have acne and ask for a Tretinoin prescription - they are easy to get. Start with 0.05% and work your way up based on what your skin can tolerate. 
4. Moisturizer: After the Tretinoin dries I seal it in with a moisturizer - this counteracts the drying/flaking effect that Tretinoin has on the skin.
5. Coconut Oil: I apply this under my eyes prior to bed to prevent wrinkles, puffiness, etc. 

# Lifting

This is the meat and potatoes of this post. If you are DYEL you have no business even talking to chicks IMO. Get your ass in the gym and lift some heavy ass weights. There is a ton of misinformation on the internet about what routines to use, what bullshit supplements to take, etc. when in reality it is very simple. You don't need supplements. You don't need steroids. All you need to do to get jacked is get as strong as possible on heavy compound movements and eat in a 100-300 calorie surplus (-100-300 surplus to cut). Furthermore, when the Russians were training athletes they did a ton of research and found that excercises that move the body through space produce more hypertrophy and work your stabilizers more. What excercises move the body through space? Weighted dips, weighted chinups, weighted pull-ups, squats, and deadlifts. Here are the exercises you need to focus on to get jacked:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Overhead Press: Blows up your delts and entire shoulder girdle. OHP should be the most important lift that you focus on. Delts are the key to an aesthetic physique. Do your presses standing rather than seated to work your core better and improve overall athleticism
2. Bench Press: Works your chest better than any other exercise. Skip the fly machines and machine presses. Get your bench as high as possible. The only things touching the bench should be your traps and butt - this slight arch puts more emphasis on the pecs and will allow you to push more weight. 
3. Weighted Dips: Also known as the upper body squat. Work chest/triceps and are one of the best compounds out there.
4. Weighted Chinups: Put a better stretch on your biceps than curls (do both) and incorporate the back as well.
5. Squats/Deadlifts: Best lifts for the lower body. Don't skip leg day. 

I understand that gyms are closed. Invest in a pullup/chinup/dip station, get a weighted belt, and some dumbells and you are good to go. Also get a bench to add accessories with dumbells. 

# Diet

Depending on your body weight, goals, etc. this will vary a lot. Don't do bullshit fad diets. Carb up before and after a workout. Don't dirty bulk. Watch your waistline. Eat tons of fruits/vegetables/lean meats/nuts/grains. Stick to whole foods and get enough protein. I'm not going to go in-depth on this here but as long as you stick to whole foods, and eat in a slight caloric surplus you should be able to gain muscle. 

# Height

If you are 5'10 or above don't worry about your height. I'm 5'11 and sloots usually think I'm pretty tall because I'm jacked and look good. However, when I go to bars/clubs or go out on dates I will wear height boosting shoes that will put me around 6'1-6'2.  When it's winter I like rocking Timberlands which have a 1-2 inch height boost built in. Look up TallMensShoes and find a pair of shoes that give you the height boost you want. I can't say it makes much of a difference for me but depending on your height it might give you more confidence. 

# Fashion

Lifting will make you look good in pretty much anything you wear. I like to dress on the preppier side as I think it's a pretty basic style that doesn't polarize too much. Here's a basic outline of how to dress:

Shirts: Find a shirt size that fits on you relatively loosely and buy one size smaller. You want to buy t-shirts that fit snugly around your arms and chest - these will make you look bigger than you are and outline your physique better.

Pants: Stick to jeans - Levis is the best brand for jeans. Buy slim fitting jeans that are darker colored. 

Jackets: Bomber jackets, leather jackets, flannel jackets are all good options

Shoes: Will vary depending on your outfit. TallMensShoes has some nice looking ones. 

Boots: The only kind I like wearing are Tims. Any shade of brown that looks halfway decent should work. 

# Attitude/Vibe

If girls are calling you anything along the lines of douchebag, meathead, jerk, etc. you are on the right track. I remember the last date I was on, I completely ignored the sloot sitting across from me and was just watching the Cowboys game, ordered Corona after Corona, and half-acknowledged what my date was saying. To top it off I split the bill, and asked if she was coming back to my place and she gladly agreed. Halfway during the date, I told her I played football in HS and love lifting - she called me a meathead and I just turned away and slammed my Corona and yelled at the Cowboys to run the fucking ball . Did I run game on her? No. Did I use a special dancing monkey neg hit pickup line from the Mystery Method? No. Did I try to jump through her shit tests and use witty banter? No. Do I have a high SMV and does she know it? Yes. That's all that matters. 

Don't take girls seriously. Don't have ""conversations"" with them. Tease them, ghost them, have fun with them, and always put yourself first.  

Be that douchebag. Don't overcomplicate things. Enjoy yourself and get laid.",32,1

"During COVID, Take Advantage of Extended Interactions For Gaming","Is gaming possible during the COVID era? Many men have wondered if the situation is truly impossible. Cold approach is oftentimes logistically impossible (you're both wearing masks) or simply frowned upon (""get away from me, virus vector!""). OLD is a reasonable alternative, but now you are competing with literally every male in the area for her attention, and if you have spent any time on a woman's dating profile, you know how that skews the odds to an extreme degree. OLD during COVID is worse than ever, as there is increased supply of males.

Part of developing a red pill personality is learning how to turn these adverse situations into an advantage. So what are the underlying dynamics and how can we adequately take advantage of them for our benefit? Firstly, because of COVID, interactions are limited. In fact, they are limited to the essentials \*by law\*. Secondly, women are craving intimacy more than ever, as they are cooped up oftentimes by themselves. The invitation from a cool guy to hang out seems much more appealing now than it did last year when she had a great social life.

Thus, you must seek out and take advantage of extended interactions to meet women. Create opportunities in which you and her are forced to interact for at least a few minutes. For example, I recently misplaced my wallet and was called by the store owner where I had left it, telling me to come and get it. Upon arrival, the women who helped me was a legit 9. Here was a great opportunity. I spent 10 minutes talking to her, I brought out the full force of my charisma, and eventually I moved the conversation to discuss how we could catch up later. Ultimately, I got the number easily. 

While this interaction fell into my lap, it doesn't always have to be that way! Create extended interactions: 

\-At a CVS to get essentials and there's a hot chick? Start speaking with her about how she's staying   
healthy during COVID and ask for pointers, and eventually move the conversation to a place where   
you can get a number! 

\- In a virtual classroom? Connect with an attractive classmate and ask how she is studying for this   
given COVID? Don't be overeager but create a connection.

\- Picking up a Starbucks? Open up the door for a hot girl and make a joke about her addiction to   
Starbucks during a pandemic. Begin a conversation while you guys are waiting for your coffee.

\- She has a cool mask? Stop her ask about how she got that mask. Once you have a hook,   
as a joke tell her that her mask is not as good as yours. Ask her about her rules for keeping safe   
during COVID, and turn the convo into something productive.

The same rules apply as normal, don't be overeager, don't simp, don't come off as a creep. The difference is that since cold approach has somewhat of a stigma now (in my opinion, at least), you want to create more natural, extended interactions. The best is if it's done for you (in my case, where the receptionist was forced to chat with me about my wallet), but create the opportunities that you can.",14,1
2021 resolutions for normies,"The end of the year is near, 
why the fuck are you on reddit? Good that I am here to share with you the tips to make 2021 your best year ever.
If you don't have time be sure to comment or bookmark it for next year.

So without further ado here they are:

1. **Waste less time.** 
Got Netflix? Cancel it. Facebook? Delete it. Twitter? Get rid of it. Instagram? Stop it. Reddit? Skip it.
 Apart from the negative influence a lot of these media have, it's often a horrible waste of time.
 Americans spend on average [1471 hours] (https://www.mandatory.com/living/1478185-social-media-wasting-time) a year watching tv.
 Malcolm Gladwell stated that it takes [10.000 hours or practice to become an expert at something](). Didn't read the book, but I gave my own twist to it: I combine it with the [pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) and I come to the conlusion that it takes only 80 hours to get 50% of the expert level. So yeah, let's be conservative and let's say it takes 100 hours to be decent at something.
 Then, go ahead, get decent at something instead of watching television. Learn to code. Learn a new language. Study nutrition. Try to master an instrument. Make your own furniture. *This is investing in yourself.*
 Waste less time on politics as well. The chance you will change something is very small anyway. Clean your own room first.

2. If the thing you picked up at #1 is not a physical activity, pick up one. Go lift, run, go play squash. It's healthy for both body and mind. Chop trees. Fix your garden. Not only does this make your body release nice hormones and improve your physique, it also decreases the chance of getting Alzheimer's later in life.* This is investing in yourself.*

3. **Waste less money.** Boosting your savings rate with [15% means you can stop working 8(!) years earlier](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/). So again, cancel that Netflix membership and skip that McDonalds meal for a nice homecooked one. This is investing in yourself.

4. Allocate some money to 'high-risk' investments. Buy Bitcoin, smart people do. Buy [Coinbase before the IPO](https://warosu.org/biz/thread/S25039356). We are in a bullmarket and the FED is printing like crazy. Cash is trash.
You are scared of a loss? The dollar lost 10% ytd versus the euro.... and versus bitcoin? More than 70% loss.

5. Make someone's day more often. Call your mother.

Appreciations &amp; Ruminations following my Red Pill Journey (Part 1/3),"*For those who are having trouble or doubting their TRP journey, my series is mostly dedicated to you. You will come to understand certain blind spots as I share with you the pitfalls in my own journey, and how I am overcoming them.*

Good afternoon fellas,

This may be my first post here, but I‚Äôve been active in the RP community between 2018 and 2019. I don‚Äôt remember the specifics that led me here, but I do recall that I was mentally in an okay spot: I was trucking well in school, had a good social circle, and was involved with a sports team. The only thing I lacked in my life was women.

After spending about 1.5 years lurking, reading, and participating, I finally left this community. Moreso than anything else, I reached a point in my life where I realized TRP could no longer help me go any further. I still occasionally frequented this subreddit, but most of my time was spent doing other things.

But I realized, after some reminiscing of my growth, that I‚Äôve never actually thanked this community for the contributions it has brought into my life. So thank you, TRP, for being the cornerstone that launched me onto my self-improvement journey. This post is my token of appreciation to you and contains information I‚Äôve gathered in the past 2 years (including some post-TRP), some which I would consider rare gems that don‚Äôt often get talked about.

This post became much longer than originally anticipated, and so will be divided into a 3-part series.

# The Textbook Red Pill Journey

Most guys who find TRP tend to come in wanting more of one thing: pussy. I know I did.

All I knew about my desire was the **what** and the **when**: I wanted some cock-wrapping, wet ass pussy, and I wanted it now. At the time, I had no awareness and no fucks to give besides quelling that thirst. The lack of women was a problem in my life, and I wanted to solve it.

TRP is often called the toolbox, and rightfully so: it answers the **how**. It has the tools that can help guys transition from being a virgin to a pussy-hammering Chad. Whether it be dating apps, cold approaches, isolation and kino, etc., there are resources somewhere within the community that gives a dummies‚Äô step-by-step guide to execute with minimal mistakes.

**Rookie Phase** ‚Äì Within a few weeks, most guys catch on that the most important goal is to increase their SMV and to find their purpose. Whether that means becoming more alpha, spinning 5 plates, earning a million dollars, or calling others beta f&amp;gs, each guy who puts in enough effort starts to ‚Äúget it‚Äù and give their own opinion on how SMV is and/or should be measured and what they life‚Äôs commitments are shaping to be.

Once they come to witness positive results in their lives, they start imagining what it means to be at the top. After becoming freer, racking their body count to 200, earning 10 million dollars, and getting tagged by the community as an ‚ÄúEndorsed Contributor‚Äù, this idea of a red pilled man can finally settle on a yacht in the middle of a sunny day in the Bahamas, sip some fancy cologne, and enjoy a cigar while getting blowed by their worst enemy‚Äôs girlfriend.

Given that TRP is a sexual strategy forum, the fact that it loves talking about the success metrics that define SMV (looks, money, status, and game) is a given. Some other topics also get some light of day, such as socioeconomics, stoicism, and nofap, because we all realize that bettering oneself will inevitably overlap into other major aspects of our (and others‚Äô) lives. As we progress a few months into our red pill journey, we discover how much interconnectivity there is‚Ä¶ in pretty much all aspects of social sciences.

# The Real Journey

But as much as we want our RP journey to be a linear progress, unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt happen that way for everyone. Refer to the normal distribution:

For those on the far right of the bell curve (let‚Äôs say \~10%), TRP was the perfect remedy. They now live a life of abundance and have no issues getting what they desire out of life;

For those on the far left (also \~10%), TRP has completely failed them. They are arguably in a worse spot in their lives than pre-TRP and have no idea what the fuck to do anymore;

And the rest of us (\~80%), who fall somewhere in the middle. For such guys, TRP brings change, but sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. Someone might take 1 step forward then 2 steps back, while others may have a few step backs before taking a 6-step leap. The path to Nirvana is not as obvious as we think it is.

There are many reasons why, but as per my own observations, there are 3 main reasons:

Our outdated notion of failure holds us back from our huge potential (1/3);

Our inability to fully internalize and embody the most important concepts (2/3);

Our lack of inward focus pushes us to only consider the ‚Äúexternal battle‚Äù and thus neglecting our inner demons and battles (3/3).

# Failure is the fangs we‚Äôve learned to avoid our entire lives

**Journey highlight #1:** When I started my TRP journey, things were progressing pretty well: I got laid for the first time, my grades were getting even better, and my social circle was expanding a lot. With these once doubtful aspects of my life showing more and more promise, my confidence levels were steadily climbing, and I was feeling much better about myself. As my confidence grew, though, something else was also growing at the same time. Something from within, something‚Ä¶ insidious.

It was fear. The fear of losing my confidence. The fear that this great sensation would one day leave me.

Like any logical person, I made a quick mental assessment to determine how I got so confident in the first place and what I could do to maintain it. I quickly deduced that my confidence rise was tied to my huge boost in SMV, which means that keeping the latter up will increase, or at least maintain, the former.

Subsequently, everything I did came down to one objective: appearing with high SMV. If I was around some program buddies, I‚Äôd talk big about my career. If I was around women, I‚Äôd make sure to appear DGAF and to show that I was a HVM. If I was around gym bros, I‚Äôd talk about my gains and PRs. If I was around some old friends, I would brag about what sort of cool entrepreneurial project I had in mind. And if I was around family, well I would just retreat to my room, log onto TRP and call others betas‚Ä¶ because my SMV mattered more online than with my parents.

The huge downside about actively maintaining SMV is that, unbeknownst to me, I started to give a shit about everyone‚Äôs opinion of me. I also started heavily relying on manipulating other people‚Äôs perception of me in order to maintain that confidence. Do x to get y. Cause and effect. I slowly became a control freak. I had a rough idea what to say on any given context to make myself look better, and subsequently, feel better.

Girl texts me? Gotta make sure to read the message, then wait exactly 15 hours before sending roughly 2/3rds of what she sent, just to show that I‚Äôm the shit, you know?

Meeting a program executive at a networking cocktail? Gotta ask questions about them, make them feel good about themselves, and open the possibility to socialize more in the future.

For a while, it was working. Though, after some time, I started to feel the incongruence in my life.

The reason why such an approach started failing is because I started tying too much of my self-worth into other people's interpretation of my SMV. And to maintain that, I started lying a lot. Not only to people, but more importantly, to myself. I was not able to critically look at myself and give myself honest feedback. Trying to maintain SMV to feel better about myself meant to constantly emulate some crazy standard in order to feel socially validated. But it increasingly became a chore. It was a losing battle that strayed **who I thought I was from who I really am**. This lasted roughly 10 months.

**Pitfall #1:** The cornerstone to Journey Highlight #1 was this: I needed external validation because I feared failure. LARPing high SMV was the overcompensation I did to avoid facing the fact that I was too scared to backtrack. Too scared to relapse into what I thought was a blue-pilled beta f&amp;g.

**Reflection #1:** If I were to be diagnosed as giving too many fucks, the suggested remedy would probably be to answer the following question: ‚ÄúHow to stop give so many fucks and not be afraid of failure?‚Äù

That‚Äôs a start, but I‚Äôll do myself one better: Why do I fear failure so much? Why can‚Äôt I just backtrack a little in my perceived SMV without getting so damn critical about myself? Why can‚Äôt I show any sign of weakness?

I can‚Äôt speak for everyone on this matter. Some people fear failure, some less. YMMV. Personally, the reason why I could not tolerate failure was because of the implications of failure.

Let me elaborate: somewhere, sometime during my early years, I was conditioned to feel guilty about failure. I learned through the process that failing was an undesirable occurrence. If I came home with a shitty grade, mom and dad would punish me. If I couldn‚Äôt keep my friends content, they would avoid me. If I liked a girl, and she didn‚Äôt like me back, she‚Äôd tell all her friends, and I get laughed at for being an idiot.

Through each experience, I internalized one shared belief: that I must maintain a certain expectation in order to be loved. That if I fail, I will be outcasted.

And fuck, that hurts. Maybe as a young adult, it‚Äôs much less burdensome to cope from that, but at an early age, we cannot possibly know how to deal with such rejection. Abandonment is a child‚Äôs worst nightmare. And thus, I navigated through life with the constant thought in the back of my mind that I couldn‚Äôt fail. Because in the remnants of my past self, there is a wounded child screaming at me, reminding me that failure means that I‚Äôm unlovable and that I deserve to be abandoned.

I came to the Red Pill to find more pussy. And while I was in the body of a 20-year-old, unbeknownst to me, I was still holding my understanding of ‚Äúfailure‚Äù from early childhood. And that notion of failure is faulty. Because failure does not mean being unworthy of love. It simply means I was wrong.

Realistically, there would be no major implication to my personal life if I got rejected by a girl. It might hurt emotionally a bit, but without the burdensome idea that my life will somehow turn to shambles if I were to fail, I can rise up and keep on truckin‚Äô.

Failure has often been an inevitable roadblock on the journey, but realizing with every new experience that failure no longer has the weight my past self once gave it gives me the closure I need to move on and live in the present. The more I exposed myself to such situations, the more I gave myself the opportunity to re-write this preconceived narrative with a healthier mental model.

**Conclusion &amp; solution #1**: I fuck up all the damn time. But instead of covering up the mistake out of some fear of not being loved and accepted, try facing the full wrath of your parents/girl/friends/this community. Your life will not take a nosedive. I came to notice that the anticipation of their reactions was worse than the reaction itself.

Sometimes, I relapse into being a blue pilled beta and dry her pussy up. Sometimes, I may come home to a temperamental parent after fucking up a test. Sometimes, I just have to tell my employer that my academic involvement is minimal because I never get recruited into student societies. But acknowledging those failures gave me the proper closure to end an unsuccessful chapter and to pave way to a new one. To give myself another shot and to learn from experience.

It has been especially important for me to continue showing compassion for myself as I stumbled along the way. It the very display that no matter what, I will never bet against myself.

No external condition lasts forever. No matter how red pilled someone is, they will still go through the ups and downs of life and get emotional. It‚Äôs part of dynamic, unpredictable fluctuations of life. I was delusional to think that I could maintain a state of sunshine and unicorns forever. Because I can‚Äôt keep plates forever. I can‚Äôt appeal to every networking peer. I can‚Äôt get accepted to every single huge firm. Sometimes, I will fall short from my expectations. Sometimes, others will see me fall flat on my face.

Being able to peer into the billboard of your own life, no matter how good or bad it is, is the first step in building long-lasting confidence. Anyone who needs to cover their tracks without honestly acknowledging their own fuck ups will never develop the kind of frame that will prepare them for the life ahead. Chad makes mistakes. But he can also acknowledge them, learn from them, brush them off, and laugh about it later on. Because he doesn‚Äôt feel the need to prove to anybody that he‚Äôs good enough.

Not to his friends, not to his woman, and definitely not to this community.

If it so happens that your notion of failure was as fucked up as mine, a huge part of the work is to unlearn your previous definition and replace it with one that better suits the context of your current life. Which brings me to the 2nd part.

What happens after you break up with her?,"My first time posting here, apologies if wrong flair and/or can't post the questions below?

I just cut off a girl I was speaking to. We were pretty much in a relationship, without saying it, but there's a lot of red flags that started showing up that i'm not bothered to deal with - so I walked away. I had to tell her 3 times in 1 day that i'm leaving her, she wouldn't take no for an answer and literally begged me not to leave her all fucking day.

She messaged me back 2 hours after the breakup text saying she doesn't want to leave on bad terms, which I agreed too (essentially friendzoning her, possibly mistake on my part?)

We've both still got each other unfollowed on social media, as she unfollowed me after the breakup, but she's doing her best to stay ""seen"" by commenting on mutual followers posts which she never does - even commenting on my cousins wife's pictures which she never does.

I don't plan on messaging her back (it's an automatic loss if I chase). She is incredibly good looking and she's never experienced a guy leaving her. 

Essentially my question is what can I expect from her next? Did I do right by accepting we shouldn't leave on bad terms?

Any advice is appreciated",32,1

The schizo larp technique - how to keep yourself on your track,"**Intro**

This post will most likely make little to no sense for people, I personally have a very difficult time expressing my thoughts since I think more in visual terms. So this is my best explanation.

**Schizo LARPING is legit**

Schizo LARPING has been a legit tool of self improvement, I believe monks had done it via the creation of a tulpa. I had only found out about the existence of tulpas after a month or so of my schizo LARP, I have yet ton reach the level of giving a voice/being able to physically see my ""tulpa"" without seeing it in my head.

**What is the schizo LARP**

The schizo LARP is a technique which I have refined for about a year now. The schizo LARP as a quick rundown is imagining yourself as a character whether it be historical or biblical, it is imagining yourself as the main character and you have to recall your life as a sort of diary/journey.

For example if you had sat on your ass all day and done fuck all, in your ""schizo larp world"" it would become ""lore"" that you sat on your ass and did nothing. See how boring it sounds? If you become autistic as fuck like me, you start becoming invested in your LARP world and create imaginary obstacles/goals. 

One thing I've realised that is similar to how the monks used tulpas is, is that I've ended up creating an imaginary character based on both historic and biblical figures. This imaginary character/tulpa, is the person you wish to be. It's the ideal man in your eyes, keep it realistic too. Don't try to set yourself some stupid goal like fucking spider man.

Now that you set yourself a target to become, you can now set yourself goals to make yourself closer to this person. My tulpa/imaginary character is a mix of Alexander the Great and David (from the David and Goliath story). I regularly for example set myself the goal of becoming stronger so I can fight like David against stronger opponents despite being smaller, this motivates me to lift harder and train judo more (albeit I already found both activities very fun anyway).

So after doing my lifting or whatever task I set myself to become one step closer to the imaginary character, I set myself a mental note/now make it lore that I trained hard. I even put exaggerations in to make it sound more interesting in my own head.

** I realised I've rambled, so here are the concise points on how to do the method**

1. Create an imaginary character you wish to become like for their QUALITIES - so don't pick shit like spiderman because you want to climb walls. But do pick someone because they are honest, brave or hardworking for example.

2. Now imagine yourself in a fantasy world/as a 3rd person narrator, narrating your life.

3. Set yourself goals to become more like your character of choice. For example if your character is a strong man, use this as motivation so you can go to the gym. 

4. Narrate your day as you go along, narrate it like your telling your future grandkids are hearing about what you did, or like a journal.

5. Stay invested in the schizo world, and think of the man you wish to become.

**Some benefits I've noticed**

1. More motivated

2. Care about women a lot less now to the extent that I could happily live life as single

3. Greater perspective on life - realised that things like women, your body count and how much you earn matter way less compared to things you achieved e.g. Being ripped/hitting a new PR is more interesting in the 3rd person narration than fucking some ugly slut off tinder.

4. More mature, I am 20 years old and feel a lot more mature/calmer compared to most of my peers - could be due to dropping LSD though.

5. Greater self confidence - knowing that I will one day become this great man I envisioned in my head gives me hope and confidence.

**Ending**

This method may not be for everyone, in fact some in the community will probably think this is silly and laugh it off. But that's fair, what helps me may not necessarily help you.",81,1

"Red Pill and its strategies are amoral, but it DOES create the types of women we all claim to despise.","Truth bomb: (Don't shoot the messenger, this isn't a moral judgment, just a matter-of-fact statement.) It is logically inconsistent to want to fuck as many women as possible and then expect to settle down with a woman who wasn't a whore unless don't give a shit about society and only your own desires. (And if that's what you want, more power to you, but be honest about it.)

Basically, if \*everyone\* adopted Red Pill sexual strategy, every woman would be a ho who eventually develops the 1,000 cock stare. In fact, I'd wager if Red Pill was more popular, these ""strategies"" we all discuss here wouldn't be shared as often but would be kept among small circles. The only reason those in the know can be so generous with the knowledge is because it doesn't cut into their slice of pussy (plenty to go around right now), so the extra ego gratification that comes from sharing this knowledge with others can add to one's self-worth we humans (as animals), seek after. **If pussy was scarce, this forum wouldn't exist.** The secrets of the game would be kept in a small circle, just like every other form of resource control when resources are limited.

Red Pill is an amazing contradiction. (As is life. Go figure.) Red pilled men create sluts at a higher frequency than likely any other category of man, and yet we reject sluts as life-partners. Uh... what?

This is not a moral judgment. It's simply a reminder to be honest about what is happening, here.",14,1
How to be the villain (FYI: villains always get laid),"**I think you‚Äôre emotionally abusive, she told me.** She sent an infographic explaining the qualities of a manipulative narcissist; red flags, she told me, with the wide-eyes of sincerity.

And maybe she was right- it read like a personality description of someone awful enough to be me. I never shy away from *conflict*, especially when I‚Äôm ‚Äú*fighting to be right*.‚Äù I try to get women to think exactly like me, and will not accept conflicting narratives. **I often tell women that they love me and ask them to repeat it.** I prefer when a woman mirrors my emotions- if I‚Äôm laughing, I didn‚Äôt hurt your feelings, *it was just teasing, you big baby*, and you should be laughing too. In this regard, I will *deny someone‚Äôs experiences* if I don‚Äôt agree with their emotional reaction, using phraseology like ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt that bad.‚Äù

I always prefer women to *read my mind, mood, or body language*‚Äì my mood which will shift, erratically and arbitrarily, throughout the day.

It may not always *feel good,* you may feel a natural instinct to be the classic *good guy,* but know that **the only cost to *doing the right thing* is your own** (look at it like charity- the nice thing to do sometimes, but do not expect a return on good guy behavior).

Got Stubble?,"Ok, I'm going to keep this very short, short like my beard(well stubble actually).  Do a quick Google Search for ""stubble vs no stubble"" and you'll notice that facial hair has a unique power. No, I'm not talking about an ""X-Men"" mutant type of power, but  an aesthetic type. It improves your facial aesthetics QUITE significantly, especially when coupled with proper grooming techniques.

There has been lots of research,as well as, anecdotal evidence to vouch for stubble's power to greatly improve the way you're treated by women(well by everyone). Women find a 10 day(3-6mm, depending on your 
hair growth rate.) stubble to be the most attractive facial hair on men. YouTube and Instagram are littered with lots of content supporting this argument. Plus, I notice a huge ""night and day"" difference how women respond to me when I'm rocking some well groomed stubble.

Don't believe me? Grow some stubble,trim it to 3-6mm length,edge up the sideburnlines, cheeklines, and neckline(no hobo shit around here). Now, go about your normal routine and watch how differently females respond to your presence. Try it, What do you have to lose?

 Jocko Willink got a 4.0 GPA in college and served in the military for 20 years as platoon commander of the notorious Navy Seals Team 3 during the Iraq War. He then retired with several honorary badges. He also wrote a best-selling book called ‚ÄòExtreme Ownership‚Äô and started a successful leadership consulting firm with War Time homie Leif Babin. Additionally, Jocko has a podcast and YouTube channel that attracts millions of subscribers. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention he‚Äôs also a blackbelt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and can probably eliminate you with his bare hands.

Jocko attributes his success to discipline.

# 6. The Power of Visualization

 In the military, discipline was not optional for Jocko as failure to be disciplined could have led to his death or that of his fellow comrades. Such extreme scenarios can immediately change how we see ourselves and our approach to life; a boy who loses his parents at a young age quickly becomes more responsible and self-sufficient. A man who is told he has lung cancer no longer sees cigarettes as an option.

So, what do we do when we don‚Äôt have extreme circumstances motivating us? Surely, we don‚Äôt have to wait for disasters in order to become more disciplined. During [episode 107 of the Tim Ferriss show](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/tim-ferriss-show/the-tim-ferriss-show/e/107-the-scariest-navy-seal-ive-ever-metand-what-he-taught-46641605), Jocko provided some amazing insight into his early-morning thoughts.

***‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking about the enemy‚Ä¶we‚Äôre gonna meet‚Ä¶when I wake up in the morning, I‚Äôm thinking to myself, ‚ÄòWhat can I do to be ready for that moment, which is coming, which is coming?‚Äô‚Äù***

To increase your discipline, you need to visualize a high-stakes situation of good or bad circumstances. Visualization is a powerful tool: often what we think repeatedly and vividly is believed by the subconscious mind which can then catapult us into action.

The first man to deadlift 500kg, Eddie Hall, attributes the success of his lift to a visualization of a deep and dark situation on which he worked with a hypnotherapist. First, find out if you are motivated by positive situations or negative ones.

When you studied at school, did getting a good grade motivate you or was it the fear of failing? What ever affects you emotionally, find it and visualize it clearly to catapult you into action.

 

# 5. Systems and habit-building

When someone asked Jocko how he is able to wake up and work out at 4:30AM every morning, this is what he said.

***‚ÄúYou can pick a song that starts off nice and mellow and that kind***  
***of builds. You gotta have the gear pre-staged. The morning gear has to be pre-staged.***  
***So we‚Äôre not pulling open drawers I‚Äôm not flipping on lights or not searching for stuff.***  
***No we get up we walk out of the room, yeah quietly ‚Äì So shut off the secondary and tertiary alarms and then get out of the room. Maybe even have your toothbrush and your toothpaste staged in another bathroom or in the kitchen.‚Äù***

He creates systems to ensure that he stays disciplined. You want to make the path of doing what needs to be done linear. The more obstacles in the way, the more opportunities for your mind to get distracted or to rationalize a way out.

Make doing the work or at least starting on it the easiest thing. Change your environment to help facilitate you achieving your goals.

For example, if you want to read more books, ensure you have a book lying on your bed ready to greet you before you go to sleep.

If you want to eat healthy: delete all meal-delivery services from your phone, throw away any junk food, and store delicious, pre-made healthy foods in the fridge.

If you want to do cardio, find a sport that you love and use it for cardio. I hate the Stairmaster, but I love hitting the boxing bag. Make life easier for yourself wherever you can.

 

# 4. Never Complain

Often, we take our lives for granted and complain as a means of coping. Jocko is very cautious as to not complain about things. He does this by putting everything into context.

When we contemplate the fact that other people in the world are battling serious health issues like cancer, sleeping with no roof over their heads and starving, we can immediately disregard our first-world problems. 

Going for a run doesn‚Äôt seem so bad when you contemplate the fact that you are lucky to have legs. Working on your business and making sales calls isn‚Äôt an issue when you realize you didn‚Äôt have to work in a mine pickaxing for blood diamonds in Sierra Leone.

# 3. Jocko Willink's 'Good'

Jocko‚Äôs most popular video is called ‚ÄòGood‚Äô. It explains his philosophy towards seemingly negative events.

*‚ÄúGood.‚Äù*

The same mentality can be used to maintain discipline. I like to call this a stoic reframe. The philosophy of stoicism is based around this principle; turning obstacles into pathways of success by reframing them in our minds.

The Roman emperor and famous stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius once said,

***‚ÄúIf you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgement of them. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgement now.‚Äù***

What stops you from being disciplined is your judgement of the task. It is the judgement that we must reframe and to it provide new meaning.

Usain Bolt was disciplined about his marathon training because he understood that more training increased his likelihood of a gold medal at the Olympics. Reframe the situation to make it fit in with your reality and goals.

When you look deep enough you will see that you can reframe almost anything, thus making it easier to stay disciplined.

#  2. The Power of Mantras

**Discipline = Freedom**

**‚ÄúGO!‚Äù**

**‚ÄúNO!‚Äù**

Jocko constantly says a lot of the same short phrases repeatedly.

These phrases are called mantras and serve as reminders for the brain. When the brain is left to its own devices it will find a way to rationalize itself out of a situation. However, when it hears a familiar phrase it will be reminded of what to do.

You cannot allow your brain to start thinking. You must replace the thinking with action. In this way mantras serve as small computer programs that initiate a desired task. Just look at Jocko‚Äôs replies on his ‚ÄòAsk me anything‚Äô Reddit post ‚Äì short, action-based, and to the point.

Leif Babin, who served in the Navy Seals, explained in Extreme Ownership how the Seals would often say ‚ÄúGood times‚Äù as a mantra. A saying that could be used to also reframe the negativity of a situation.

 

# 1. Enjoy the process

 

Jocko talks about the myth of Sisyphus ‚Äì a Greek king who was punished by Zeus for his cruelty. He was forced to push a huge boulder up a steep hill only to watch it roll back down again. This cycle would repeat itself for an eternity. Jocko compares his life to Sisyphus; his grind being squatting for over 25 years, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, building businesses, and his time in the military.

However, the main difference between Sisyphus and Jocko is this:

***‚ÄúIf I ever got the rock to the top of the mountain and it stayed there‚Ä¶¬†I‚Äôd push it back down myself.‚Äù***

You must learn to love the process. Love the grind of doing hard shit because the path is fulfilling. It‚Äôs never about the goal, and it never has been. It‚Äôs about who you become through the process, so you must fall in love with it.

¬†Jocko is a series winner and has been able to achieve greatness and freedom through his extreme discipline. However, you don‚Äôt need to serve in the Navy Seals to develop amazing discipline. Utilize the tools at your disposal: visualization, creating systems, never complaining, stoic reframes, personal mantras, and remember to enjoy the process.",71,1

Evolving What TRP Means To Us,"We all came here because we wanted the truth about what makes women tick in the department of sex but as time went on, I see more and more talk about TRP being a toolbox with things to give and take, such as making money and being successful, but still with the goal of having sex with a woman. We talk about self improvement as a way to get pussy but I believe there is much more to it than that, and that women/sexual strategy should not be the goal of TRP.

First, we have to understand what we can and cannot control in our lives. When we are young, more people have control over us and how we think (our parents, relatives, friends, the media etc). That control they exert over us SHOULD ideally wane as we get older and we think for ourselves but of course, the struggle we face is when we are given false information such as from our parents/relatives (ex. Happy wife, Happy life, etc) or the media (ex. the Disney blue pill nice guy narrative). Those giving us false information will also struggle to maintain that control over us as we get older and will keep feeding us lies in order to have influence over us. 

Being young, we believe those things and live by those principles but then, we indirectly create expectations/covert contracts in our minds as to what life SHOULD be like vs what it actually IS. When we experience the truth and can‚Äôt understand why does Becky fall for Chad while you getting her flowers and treating her nicely puts you in the friend zone, it creates anger and is the source of a lot of incels nowadays.  

As guys, we naturally want to have sex, much more than women for the most part. We find TRP and expose ourselves to the truth, with the goal of having sex. Some of us accept it fairly easily, others take time to process, and some may never believe it at all. We see what women respond to, then we go out and exercise those principles. But in this case, we again create expectations/covert contracts.  

Relating to u/seasonedRP‚Äôs recent post about self improvement not being your sexual strategy, you are simply replacing what you think will work in getting sex (replacing being a nice guy with self improvement), and are not seeing the forest for the trees.

This is where we have to change what the definition of TRP should be. Yes, we as men want to have sex and it is very important, but it is not the whole picture. We have to understand what role and impact self improvement has in our lives and what it can do for us. How it can lead to an overall satisfaction with life. Stoicism can also help reinforce these truths and the bigger picture.

We were born alone and we will die alone, all we have is ourselves. We owe it to ourselves to be the best version we possibly can be, in all aspects of our lives, physically, socially, mentally, emotionally. This is what we CAN control.

By improving ourselves, we then improve our chances of enjoying the byproducts of that self improvement. Those byproducts being sex with women, having friends, making money, being successful etc etc. There is no guarantee we will get those things, but it puts us at a much better advantage. But we also have to understand what we can and cannot control because by understanding what we cannot control, we stop creating expectations/covert contracts and start understanding what is within our control.

Just like we say, she isn‚Äôt yours, it‚Äôs just your turn, we reinforce what we can and cannot control in a sexual strategy standpoint. We live this life and ride this roller coaster until it‚Äôs our time to leave this Earth in whatever fashion we may. This is where we must control what we can to improve our lives in general, not just for sex.

What TRP means to us has evolved and we should accept that the emphasis on self improvement must apply to more than just sexual strategy in order to increase our own happiness and satisfaction with life. We must understand and accept what we can and cannot control in our lives so that we live life by its true principles and not under the principles of someone/something else, in order to have overall happiness.",25,1
How to handle loss of motivation to pursue women?,"Hi, over the years I've learned a lot about women, some good things, but some bad things that seem to weigh heavier than the good things. I used to be infatuated with them and got butterflies, agreed with everything they said, overthought texts and interactions, gave too much attention, paid for dates before even really getting to know them etc. However, over time, through personal experiences and through reading TRP,  they have become exceedingly more transparent and dull in my minds eye. I know it's a word that has negative connotation just because of it's history, but I think that women are essentially more ""cringe-y"" to me than they used to be, when I catch certain things that they tend to do, if that makes sense. 

 Basically, what I'm saying is I'm becoming less inclined to want to pursue them because it almost feels like its not worth the ""game"" of all of it so to speak after learning more about their nature, and women that I tend to enjoy being around do not attract me on a sexual level. How did you guys get around this feeling? Besides the sex what makes it worth it to you guys to continue the game?",19,1
Are You Getting the Best of Her?,"**Are You Getting [the Best of Her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnIwCsQYoEc0)?**

A)	 Rummaging through a rarely used closet, he finds a video of her banging 4 guys while eating another girl‚Äôs pussy, screaming that she‚Äôs a filthy whore and then taking a *bukkake* at the end.

2021 Predictions for the Sexual Market [Warning Politics],"We usually try to tread lightly on politics because sexual strategy is so much more than us vs them or red vs blue, but right now there's a stark reality that many of us have been talking about for years: The sexual market  IS political and politics plays heavily into the sexual market.

This has been true any many (including myself) have commented on it in the past, but it has never been better demonstrated than by the lockdowns, the virus, and social distancing.

Teens and young adults have been committing suicide at a greater rate than ever before, and the reason is quite simple: ISOLATION.

It's been said a million times before, but TRP has saved many lives. Before covid, men across the globe already knew isolation and felt alone. It was the tools we provided that gave them the fighting chance to connect with the opposite sex and find themselves in the process. As a side effect, it gave us a great opportunity to meet other like-minded men. 

But now a new foe is at our door- Can't meet women if the places you meet new people are shut down. Schools, bars, restaurants, museums, libraries, stores, all closed. Tinder pictures show masks instead of faces. In places where you can meet- you must be covered so you cannot connect with others.

2021 is going to be a new year with a new market and new challenges. 

If you're weak at heart or unable to handle political leanings, this is not the thread for you.

"The sad, twisted story of the BETA WIDOW","**I met Lizzy (32) a few months before she skipped town-** a pallete swap in place of something truly new; a different cast of characters but the same old problems. Instead of the purple-and-black ninja, now they‚Äôre red-and-blue; she wanted a husband, but only met wolves- well fed, but when is anything ever enough?

**She lucked out when she met a big fat motherfucker who invented [REDACTED] and was filthy rich.** Suddenly, her way of talking about relationships changed entirely. No longer framing things in terms of passion and chemistry, Lizzy had now ‚Äúfound her best friend,‚Äù and ‚Äúdiscovered what love really was,‚Äù which I supposed sounded better than ‚Äúhe‚Äôs fucking disgusting, but he‚Äôs a multi-millionaire.‚Äù

...

**It didn‚Äôt work out with the fat motherfucker- maybe was a little too good to be true; maybe he was just another wolf, but one who had come up with his own way to get it.** Back to the drawing board; ground zero- she started reading books on being brave, just in case.

Years later, she managed to meet someone in-between hungry coyote and master wolf; tall and weathered, overweight with high school sports achievements in the rearview for a few stories on a Friday night. If we didn't live in hell, this is who she‚Äôd have married out of high school- two kids, a two-car garage; yard work, soccer practice, kung-foo classes, and all that shit.

**She took the long way around, but she didn‚Äôt time the market right.** She had to catch a falling knife, and this is where she ended up- knuckles punctured, hands bloody. For Valentine‚Äôs Day, he bought her designer shoes with a note attached: ‚Äúa reminder to never settle for anything less than what you‚Äôre worth ‚Ä¶‚Äù

As if she didn‚Äôt already know.

**Lesson:** Remember this- EVERYTHING IS SEXUAL STRATEGY. There is *alpha-male* sexual strategy and *beta-male* sexual strategy. We preach alpha sexual strategy because it has, by far, the biggest returns: genuine attraction from a woman leads to genuine obsession- a relationship where *you call the shots.* The beta-male, using *beta sexual strategy*- throwing money around until she's on the hook to get her claws in- will never enjoy these benefits and be treated like a bitch in relationships, but he'll still get it in... and hopefully he's not dumb enough to stick around after.

Self Improvement Should Not Be Your Sexual Strategy,"I see a lot of posts on here from people confused over what this sub is about. It's about sexual strategy, i.e., how to be more successful with women. That's true whether your goal is to spin plates or have an LTR. 

We talk a lot on here about self improvement. Ultimately, self improvement is to benefit you. If you are scrawny or a fat ass or play video games all day and have no career prospects, you need to hit the gym, clean up your diet, and start taking steps to better yourself. Doing so will make you happier. 

Many on here believe that if they follow a strict regimen of self improvement, they will one day attract women. Self improvement is their sexual strategy. The characteristics of people who do this vary. Some are uncomfortable interacting with women, others are tradcons who are morally repulsed at things like PUAs and spinning plates. 

It's true that successful self improvement will help you attract women. But if you don't understand sexual strategy, you won't do well with them. I've seen it over and over. I know many guys who are fit and quite successful, but they don't have a clue about RP. They always follow the rules, make good money, adhere to a strict diet, exercise regularly, have read deep books, and are all around good, moral people. 

Unfortunately, these things don't give women tingles. And since these guys don't understand RP, they commonly make it worse by doing things like expressing their feelings and intentions to women, calling and texting regularly, providing all the attention women seek from them, losing their cool, or attempting to set boundaries in a hectoring manner.  Or some combination of the foregoing. Women view them as betas and often snatch them up for marriage. And these guys experience divorce, cheating, being treated like shit, or some combination of the three. Women simply aren't attracted to these qualities.

RP will teach you what women are really attracted to. And if you understand RP, you can use it to your advantage with women while still being successful in other areas. No one says you have to be a druggie or a degenerate. You should always to strive to improve yourself, but do it for you, not in the hopes that one day it will attract women. Learn RP for that.",88,1
"Her Friends, Your Enemies","**Her Friends, Your Enemies**

When your girlfriend/LTR/OLTR introduced you to her friends, remember they are her friends ‚Äì not your friends.  In fact there will likely be 1-2 girls in the group that *hate* the others and secretly want them to fail, especially with relationships.  

Why?

First, interfering in other people‚Äôs relationships is the Female National Sport.  In Every Country in the World.

Second, women *hate* it when one of their friends is happier than they are ‚Äì has a better boyfriend (or has a boyfriend at all), lives in a nicer house, drives a nicer car, etc.  There is a reason that the word ‚Äúfrenemy‚Äù was invented in the context of female relationships.  In any group of female friends there‚Äôs always at least one who hates 1 or 2 of the others and wants to wreck their shit.

How will this manifest itself?

**Girl on Girl Crime**

It may be with an ‚Äúattack‚Äù of some type on the girl, although this is less common.  As an example, when I was at uni, I took up with a girl who fit my type: tall, willowy, introvert, submissive in the bedroom, etc.  I was happy and she was happy.  She had a roommate who was initially supportive ‚Äì she got concert tickets from her work for a band I loved (but she did not) and was happy to give them to me on the condition that I took my not-quite-yet-then girlfriend (which I was going to do anyway; she was a big fan also) ‚Äì but later became resentful.  

She became resentful because she was maybe a 5, and didn‚Äôt have a boyfriend and her roommate did.  She went out of her way to make my gf uncomfortable ‚Äì bullshit stuff, the ‚Äúsilent treatment‚Äù or whatever ‚Äì and so my gf spent even more time down in my room (we lived in the same dorm) and since we spent most of our time fucking that was fine with me.  WTF did I know, I was 19 and had a hot 19 y.o. gf who would have sex with me as much as I wanted.  Vaz = Happy.  Anyway, the roommate, who was something of a ‚Äúqueen bee‚Äù - was unhappy because my gf had been pulled out of her orbit and into mine.  She was feeling a ‚Äúloss of friendship‚Äù and reacted in such a way that it only drove her friend further away.  

As the roommate and I had actually known each other before, once I found out what was up, she and I had a civil discussion and I agreed that the gf and I would spend more time hanging out with her and the other roommates (there were 5 total), so long as she would ‚Äúplay nice‚Äù and so it resolved itself for the rest of the academic year.

**The Well Poisoner**

Other times, it manifests itself as an attack on YOU by the jealous friend.  This is more insidious.  The frenemy proceeds as if she is being the ‚Äútrusted friend‚Äù giving ‚Äúwise advice‚Äù to your girlfriend but really she is trying to sabotage things.  

Many years ago, I had an OLDR who lived in DC, while I lived in NYC ‚Äì four hours by car, an hour by plane ‚Äì and it was nice.  I was self-employed at the time, so I would arrive on Thursday and then depart on Sunday night.  She would cook for me, dress in the lingerie that I liked, do whatever freaky shit that I wanted in bed and had a few good ideas of her own.  It was good.

Until‚Ä¶. 

Until her friend Roxanne got wind of things.  Roxanne or ‚ÄúToxic Roxy‚Äù as I would call her, had managed to get divorced, twice, by age 24 and, as I understood from my gf, it was the guy who ended things both time.  Think that over: all she had to do was be attractive, willing to fuck a lot and not be a nagging bitch, and a lot guys at that age would be happy, or at least happy enough to stick around.  So she was a loser, and she didn‚Äôt want to be left high and dry as the only single girl in her friend group.  

My OLDR also had a friend, Sophia, who was happily married who advised her *‚ÄúMen like Vaz do not grow on trees.  You should do whatever it takes to keep him.‚Äù*  So yeah, Sophia was cool.

Toxic Roxy would attempt to invite herself over on nights that I was there to interfere, and would drip, drip, drip poison in my gf‚Äôs ear when I wasn‚Äôt.  So after a time I would arrive and I‚Äôd get hit with:

GF: *‚ÄúRoxanne says you do {some bullshit}‚Äù*
Me: *‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs not accurate because {facts}‚Äù*

GF:  *‚ÄúRoxanne says you do {some other bullshit}‚Äù*
Me: *‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true because {other facts}‚Äù*

GF:  *‚ÄúYou always‚Ä¶‚Äù*
Me: *‚ÄúFirst, tell Roxanne to shut up.  Second, why are you listening to a no-man-having, two-time loser instead of Sophia, who is actually happy?‚Äù*

Alas, she did not listen to Sophia, and we can all see where this was going (and, indeed, went.) She was being gaslighted by Toxic Roxy, and also by her mom ‚Äì her mom was on the scene and would trash talk me also, because she was a selfish bitch, and what if Gf married me and moved to NYC?  Who would be mom‚Äôs footstool then?  So it was 2 on 1 (or 2 on 2 if you count Sophia, but she was usually off keeping her husband happy by doing ‚Äúgood wife‚Äù stuff.)

She took up with a local option ‚Äì one that Toxic Roxy and mom pushed on her, until she started dating him and guess who they *hated* then?!  I know this because she rang me to bitch about it.  Me: *‚ÄúHmm.  If only you had had a man in your life who was wise and told you that these two cunty bitches were sabotaging your relationships‚Ä¶oh, wait.  Never mind.‚Äù*  

Things got worse for her, and she would ring me and just sob and beg for me to take her back, and I told her to go invent a time machine and go back in time to slap some sense into her past self, and then, ok, but otherwise, well, you can‚Äôt un-ring a bell.  So that tale does not have a happy ending.

I was also dating locally, so it wasn‚Äôt terrible, but she was a key part of my rotation.  It was just irritating that one or two cunty bitches and ruin things.  

**Takeaways**

-Women are huuuuge bucket crabs.  The happier your LTR is, the more one or more of her girlfriends will try to fuck things up for her, and by extension, you.

-If one of your LTRs friends is unhappy because she‚Äôs single, fat, a bitch or all three (i.e. a radical feminist), you need to protect yourself.  The mom in the above tale was a cunt, but sometimes moms can be helpful, if they like you.

-You can try to inoculate your gf by pointing out negative behaviors among her friends, when topical, but once you see this sort of shit, you need to consider developing an exit strategy.",143,1

"Tinder, Coronavirus, and the Holy Grail","This is a new strategy that I've had great success with. I live in Los Angeles where basically everything is shut down: All restaurants, bars, and anything you would normally do on a first date. 

Sounds bad right? NOPE. Just invite the bitch to your house.

There are two types of girls on tinder. Those who are are down to fuck on a first date, and those have already decided they don't want to fuck on a first date or would need some serious seducing. Both types would usually initially be resistant to a first date at your house, wanting to be ""wined and dined"" first.

But this situation offers the perfect excuse to give to the first type so they end up coming straight to your house without feeling too easy. ""All of my favorite spots are closed because of the pandemic, want to come over to my place and have a home-cooked meal?""

It sounds reasonable because it it reasonable, what the fuck else is there to do?

The result is that, the girls who are trying to play the long game will usually opt out (in which case you can next them). The girls who are down to fuck on the first date will agree to come to your place, and will almost always fuck by the end of the night.",117,1

[ average height,legit 7-8/10 movie actor face,stubbled out,stocky build,broad shoulders,back,chest,arms,powerlifter belly,masculine swaggering body language,charisma,""game"".]


80% OF YOUR DAY IN ANY ENVIRONMENT WITH WOMEN,EVEN WORK OR SHOPPING:
[ except bars,clubs,parties,college. Places where females are drunk or full of college ""superslut"" confidence.]



#Most People You Meet:

Probably 80% dudes in the room,gas station,mall,where ever either wants to BE SUPER COOL WITH YOU OUT OF THE BLUE OR BEEF WITH YOU FOR NO REASON(especially if females are around). EVERY 40+ FEMALE(AND MOST SUB 5's TOO)  WANTS YOUR ATTENTION,THROWS SIGNALS,STARTS CONVOS,TOUCHES YOUR MUSCLES,FLIRTS.


#The treatment:

YET WHEN DEALING WITH FEMALES(even females you ALREADY KNOW) THAT ARE UNDER 40ISH,ARE 5 OR HIGHER IN LOOKS,AND NOT DRUNK:

you are AGGRESSIVELY Ducked,dodged,avoided like the plague,not acknowledged in a room,every average looking or slight above average looking dude in the room gets spoken to and positive feedback when interacting,you get no feedback or negative feedback,an "" I don't really want you in my face"" type vibe,you get the "" elephant in the room"" treatment, they see you and INSTANTLY AVOID YOU,GO THE OTHER WAY,WALK OUT OF THE AREA,OFF THE EISLE, LEAVE THE VICINITY,they won't look you in the eye,won't speak,barely(or not at all) reply when you speak to them,if 1 does flirt or respond positively to you flirting with her she's MOST LIKELY JUST GETTING AN EGO BOOST,FLAKE ON YOUR CALLS AND TEXTS,don't return your calls and texts,make you wait longer when you go to restaurants,hand you your food while looking at other ppl,sit your food on the counter and walk off without saying shit,try to ""knock you down a peg"",ignore you,brush you off,cold shoulder you,silent treatment you,dickride every inferior dude in the room while avoiding you like the fucking plague, anytime you small talk or flirt it's not even taken seriously,talk about ,""cake bake"" over the phone with,and gossip about a bunch of ugly  muscless weak fakeass lameass cornball garbageass clownass uglyass no sex appeal no muscle low swagger low charisma dudes THAT SHE LOOKS PHYSICALLY BETTER THAN, fuck and suck said dudes.


#The reason:
The treatment of both ugly dudes and handsome(masculine) guys is pretty much the same,the reasons differ.  The ugly guys get ""the treatment"" because females see them as below her value and not worthy of her time/attention/being in her presence.

The handsome(masculine) guys get ""the treatment"" because the females are nervous,insecure,low self esteem,and have a VERY HIGH BUT FRAGILE FEMALE NARCISSISTIC EGO. if females operate on feels then being around a masculine handsome guy who SHE HAS NO POWER(her looks/body) OVER and FEARS REJECTION FROM  makes her feel like shit. So she gives him ""the treatment"".

Kill the cancer.,"There‚Äôs a cancer here in TRP that seemed to have infiltrated 95% of the readers. It‚Äôs in stage 4 and uncontrollable. So bad that it affected your ability to think and ponder. Stunted your ability to wrestle with a post and dive into the depths of what the author might be getting at. It turned thoughtful thinking and pausing into emotional reactionary sperg‚Äôism pushing you into blurting out your emotions into a comment before you can even pull your weiner out.   

&amp;#x200B;

It blinded you to the fact that the sidebar is fundamental knowledge necessary to post or reply to a topic. Instead of lifting weights and improving your psychological faculties that come from said activity, it turned you into a keyboard bitch moaning about the slightest humour or topic that ‚Äúoffends‚Äù you that is not a bullet point list on how to jerk yourself off about how ‚Äúalphalfa‚Äù you are when you finally talk to that girl that is special and ‚Äúshe would never break your little heart‚Äù. Your feelings now rule your judgement. If a post isn‚Äôt telling you to make your bed and the steps needed to make your bed you lash out like a child moaning about ‚Äúthe quality of this forum‚Äù.  

&amp;#x200B;

It‚Äôs my view that  purge is necessary. /u/redpillschool can lock this sub for 3 to 6mo with a stickied post saying ‚ÄúRead the sidebar‚Äù. In theory, this should get rid of the spergs who‚Äôs attention span is so short they can‚Äôt go 10min without their dopamine spike. The ‚Äúrealll meennn‚Äù will do as their told and acquire the necessary knowledge that is freely available in the sidebar so they can come back and add to the conversation instead of bitching. The knowledge within the sidebar is relevant, and will be relevant to humans and our interactions for decades to come. There is no need for constant new posts that regurgitate the same topics and 99% of the time miss the mark. Instead of complaining about the said regurgitated material, get the fuck off this sub and work on your life. Shut up and stop complaining. You‚Äôre adding to the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù, not solving it. There is a wealth of info on this sub dating back years. Your work is not complete.   

&amp;#x200B;

[Are you squatting at least 1.5x  your bodyweight](http://archive.is/2kcxU) below parallel? Did you stick to a basic 6-lift program for 3mo and made gains that are measurable in different domains? Did you read, and study the highest rated posts about social dynamics over the last years, implemented it and made notes about your failure? Did you do weightlifting for your brain and picked up a hard book from a philosopher and wrestled with the content? All this is fundamental. Pick up a banned book, read it, and see why the author is hated. You don‚Äôt need to agree with them, but understand what made them tick.  

&amp;#x200B;

If you truly want to change your life, stop coming here and jerking yourself off. This goes against what the mods/owners/ECs want because without the fans there would be no TRP. But you can only write so much content. Everything has been said. What would be interesting, is locking this sub for 6mo, then when we come back seeing all the success stories of guys who truly put the sidebar and other knowledge to use. Field reports should be banned in my view. You got your dick wet because you faked your alphalfa‚Äôness, good job. Lessons learned are the same, human interactions don‚Äôt change much, so what did you learn? The same thing Johnny who posted before you learned. Great job.   

&amp;#x200B;

But, as long as you stay within the posting guidelines you can write whatever you want and validate what has already been written about in the sidebar and get a high five from you fellow masturbators. Take your left hand, and type out how your feelings are hurt and you didn‚Äôt get any message out of this post. 

Or, make a decision to kill the cancer and nuke it with chemo.",4,1
99% of you are pathetic losers,"Looks like I only need to scroll on this withering sub for a few minutes to see the general consensus here has diverged these past few years. 

All I read is how to manipulate people (girls and partners) to look all alpha and all this bs. All you guys do is overthink, and then comment like your bollocks are the size of the moon.

When has the definition of value gone from your value, to yourself and society, to being about looking cool and lying your way to get there. All this talk about ‚Äúgame‚Äù and ‚Äúfake it till you make it‚Äù is the wrong mindset. 

You want value but what value are you seeking? Value attained from others? Or from yourself? 

What? You‚Äôre going to spend racks on a pair of shoes to look like you have money for these dog women you see round every corner? Or put that in a savings/investment plan to secure your future, or buy yourself something you will actually enjoy. 

My point is, all I see in this sub nowadays:
1: Overthinking 
2: Faking it

When ever you see some 10,000 word post on the dynamics of gaming colleagues or some other contrived bullshit just save yourself the effort. How about instead of faking your status you actually build yourself up to the point you don‚Äôt fake it???

90% of TRP can be condensed in the following principle: 
Become the best version of yourself. Attain value. Wealth, your physique, forging quality relationships, pursuing all your interests. Value is the universal bedrock of success in all areas. You have value, life is easy. Because you exercise your value to make it so.

I literally put zero thought in when I speak to women. Meaning, I don‚Äôt give enough of a shit about them to speak anything other than what‚Äôs on my mind. I‚Äôm literally myself. I don‚Äôt need to put on some facade, my genuine value is good enough. Because I worked for it, instead of blagging it.

I remember reading a post where someone recommended taking photos at a beach from different angles to look like they travelled to different places. Or someone recommended hiring a photographer with a fucking DSLR and go on a photo shoot for their tinder profile photos. 

Someone really suggested befriending a beta and telling them fake interesting stories as a means of appearing cool to their colleagues.

If you haven‚Äôt clocked it by now, stop being a fake dickhead who puts maximum effort in these pointless endeavours. If you tried half as hard to improve yourself you‚Äôd see better results.",117,1

I hope my friends' relationships are the exception,"Don't talk about fight club. Most of my friends are people I've known for years and are either in serious long-term relationships with the intention of getting married, or are already engaged. With what I know now, it's clear, to me at least, that marriage is financial suicide for men. My blue pill friends don't know this though. 

My one friend recently got engaged. He spoke about how his now-fiancee hits him and threatens to report him for abuse, despite him never touching her, making arguments out of thin air, keeps her money from him while taking his money, and always taking her family's side; her mother hates him by the way. Additionally, he's trapped because they already have a child together. I can't imagine what his life will be when he officially gets married.

Though it's unlikely, I always hope that my friends' girlfriends/fiancees are the exception to the rule to some degree; that they won't pull the bait and switch once the knot has been tied. That they won't cheat behind their back and proceed take them to the cleaners by divorcing them. Only time will tell.

TL;DR: I want my friends to have successful marriages, despite the odds being stacked against them.",87,1

Red Pill Movie / Good Examples Of Masculinity - Papillon (1973),"This movie is just so damn good at portraying what masculinity really is. Even the sequence with the village, you can clearly see the dichotomy between the main character and his little village girl friend even though there is very little dialogue.

But by far, the best part is the prison scene, the amount of sheer will displayed is just insane and the fact that even when facing death, the main character does not want to rat his friend out who gave him the food is insanely inspiring.

This one of those movies you watch many times and it just doesn‚Äôt get old. (i‚Äôm on my 5th re-watch).

It also makes the 2018 version look like child‚Äôs play. McQueen in the 1973 version is obviously an amazing actor, and Hoffman plays a great role.

I think one of the reasons real masculinity is so rare now is because we have no role models in the modern world. Movie stars, and celebrities are valued for everything but masculinity. But movies like Papillon, take you back to a time when masculinity was valued and displayed. Even though it‚Äôs a film, there‚Äôs a ton to learn from it, imo.

I know tomorrow when I wake up for my morning run, and while I train to compete in my sport, that I will be pushing myself a little harder because of the movie. My personal major takeaway, being that you should fight everyday to push yourself, and challenge yourself, how hard you fight for the things you want shows how much of a man you are. How much fight do you have?

Seriously.

Watch the movie.",13,1
If you want to know her REAL sexual history...,"**If you want to know her number- her real number- you need to approach the conversation delicately.** If you lead with how you‚Äôre ‚Äúsick of the sluts on Plenty of Fish‚Äù- land of the washed-up party girl- she‚Äôs going to throw you a number impossibly low for an eternally single girl edging forty.

You could let yourself believe you‚Äôve found something more valuable than all the money in the world- life‚Äôs reset-button, a chance to start over.

If you want the real number, you‚Äôll need to speak her language- a non-judgmental perspective. **You‚Äôre hip enough to have your own crazy stories, you‚Äôre on the warm side of the pool, sitting at the cool kid‚Äôs table- this is the only way she‚Äôll feel comfortable telling you something more closely resembling the truth.** Knowing this will ruin any prospect you had of having a relationship with her- at best, you‚Äôll be another notch- and if you liked her enough, you‚Äôll have wish she lied- people want you to lie.

How A Real Alpha Buys Christmas Presents üéÅ,"You homos probably already bought a bunch of gay presents for your wife's son, but here's how you would have done it if you were an alpha like me:

Knee Pads. Every Christmas I always buy knee pads for my main girlfriend, my side bitch, my mistress, your mom, etc

At least five pairs of knee pads. Every year it gets more expensive, but it's the least I could do for all of the women in my life who spend time on their knees sucking, fucking, doggy-styling and cleaning my house.

You probably don't think giving Christmas gifts is alpha. In fact you probably prefer receiving... with your ass. Today I'm going to teach y'all queers how a real alpha gives gifts.

Being an alpha is about giving what you want, not what they want. I live by a code. Like that time I gave a college freshman my Boston clam chowder, one drunk man's trash is another man's lukewarm, half eaten meal. Come the holidays, I'm always in the spirit of giving. Especially loads.

She didn't want my baby gravy. I told her, relax babe, I'm gonna pull out. But I didn't. Because a real alpha isn't afraid to change the game plan. Life throws obstacles at you: LMR, children out of wedlock, warrants for your arrest, that's just part of being alpha, bro. There's a lesson in there fellas. Write it down. Thank me later.

Let's talk Menthol Cough Drops. Personally, I just go to Costco and buy a crate. Why? Because I care about women. This is the season of giving.

Imagine having 9 Incher power slamming into your larynx for 30 minutes. Huh? Half you queers don't even have to strain your imagination. You're gonna need a cough drop or two. Maybe some orange tic tacs, get the smell of loads out of your mouth when my mother comes over. It's disrespectful.

You got some special ladies in your life? Be a gentleman and offer them a handful after she does her due diligence on the ol meathammer, if you catch my drift. It's quite literally the least you could do.

Bedsheets: Ok, this is a big ticket item here, I'm not gonna lie. You can't make a habit of splurging left and right spending $45 money you don't have, I get it. But hear me out.

If you've got a special lady in your life, you buy her some bedsheets. Why? Cause we've all been there. A romantic evening, you're feeling experimental. You half ass some line about how you're only 2/3 of the way there from your relationship being fully consummated. Sweetheart, you're the goods, I love your beautiful soft eyes, the way you knit sweaters, the way you're capable of utilizing Microsoft Excel. I don't want anything left unsaid between us.

A One, a two, you stick it in the poo. Whoops, you pull out too fast. Ok accidents happen. She's gonna need new bed sheets.

I'll I'm saying is when you find yourself in this situation, don't be pointing stinky fingers assigning blame. You got your peanut butter in my chocolate, what gives? Look, we're all adults here, hopefully. Just hose her down and take her to bed bath and beyond. When she asks why you put more lube in the cart, you say ""beyond"". It's thoughtful. Women appreciate that.

Ok I know I just spent the majority of my article talking about what to buy women this Christmas. I didn't talk about what you buy the fellas and you's probaby thinking I'm some kind of Feminism.

But look fellas, we hang out all year. You never once complimented me on the dimple on my chin, my long lashes, and my manicured brow. Now all of a sudden when the holidays rolls around, I gotta go to the Apple store and buy you another hardcore porn e reader.

But don't sweat it. I did get you a Christmas present. It's this article . Not only did I give you the ultimate gift: the opportunity to fantasize about being an Alpha male, and let's face it that's why you are here in the first place.

Manipulating Your Environment,"Many guys on ask TRP ask why they can‚Äôt get any play even though they busted their ass to max their SMV in all aspects; look good, dress well, body language, etc. The reason why is lack of status. ‚ÄúHow does one build status?‚Äù One may ask. And a lot of people on TRP simply aren‚Äôt fit to answer such a question. Well let me tell you something I‚Äôve been exposed to in real life experience that isn‚Äôt talked about on the red pill a lot.

The Game: this is the one thing many guys lack knowledge of it as it is very minimally covered within TRP and poorly conveyed in the pua community. We all know about social proof and perceived SMV, but how does one build status without having SMV to begin with? Why should he wait until he can bench 300lbs then go out and approach and form social circles? Understanding how to manipulate your environment to boost your SMV (instead of lowering it) is vital to The Game. You can have an SMV of 8 or 8.5 and not pull shit because your lack of game demotes you to a 7 (and that‚Äôs just being generous).

**How does one manipulate their environment?**

Not every guy who‚Äôs successful with women was born with their dick in some hot girl‚Äôs vagina. Many events successively led up to that point for them. Narcissism is seen as attractive not because it brings out the primal instincts of a woman, but because the narcissist is impeccable in imposing his frame of superiority on others. In the same way, you must manipulate your environment by imposing your frame unto others in which you possess all the qualities of the alpha.

However, you need to learn to be able to do this by using explicit social rules so as to not come off as socially autistic. One way I like going about this is leveraging a beta with a weak frame (who I know loves to spread rumours and talk about other people, someone who already sees you as superior) and gain their trust. Then I humblebrag to them about all the crazy shit I‚Äôve done (true or not, who cares) and as long as your frame is stronger, they will believe it entirely. The magic comes in where they spread this information among everyone else within that social circle. People believe that because you and Percy the beta are closer than they are to you, that he has some sort of special insight into your life (when really you just fed Percy delusion), and they believe it. From then on, the hard part is over. Now you just have to *fake it till you make it* and when someone asks about whatever rumour, you deflect with sarcasm and not give a clear answer. If someone asks me: ‚Äúdo you pull girls?‚Äù, I‚Äôm not going to tell them yes or no, because those are both things that someone who doesn‚Äôt pull girls would say, instead I brush them off with a sarcastic or vague reply. If someone thinks you are a loser and you do this, it won‚Äôt really work. That‚Äôs why you need to unbitch yourself before even entering said social circle. Leaving people in the unknown opens a world of opportunities for their hamster to spin and create some exaggerated fantasy about you. This is why gaming betas to leverage social proof is crucial since they act a lot like girls. 

**Faking It Till You Make It**

This is the game. The game is, at a high level of awareness, following explicit social rules while manipulating your environment through implicit social rules. If someone asks me how I get girls, I‚Äôm not gonna tell them I‚Äôm red pilled as that would completely break the implicit social fabric and make me look fucking autistic and potentially ruin my reputation. To navigate through today‚Äôs society, you need to be completely aware of the inner social workings at play while by any means never exposing them.

In one of my social circles, I run a completely different game than in another. Although my Base SMV is equal in all of my social circles, my social standing and power level vary immensely.
In fact, in one of my social circles I pulled many girls and it‚Äôs known clearly throughout the whole circle that I can pull easily. However, I broke implicit social rules here and bragged about it etc. in order to lower my perceived SMV and come off as a douche and untrustworthy. In my social circle at school, I have had less success with girls (never really liked shitting where I eat), yet my perceived SMV is higher because I rumour has it I bagged every bitch in town. This goes to show that your perceived SMV is completely independent of your true SMV. Once you have been able to fake it, your perceived SMV will allow you to reap the plentiful rewards (That is, until you fuck up and blow your cover).

**Conclusion**

Keep imposing your frame of the person you want to be, and soon enough, your environment will conform to you and turn you into that person. Without being able to build decent social status within your circles, you won‚Äôt get any play despite your SMV.

Learn from my Dumbass (aka You Are Not Alone),"As a RedPill lurker I have ALOT to learn. If I'm gonna be frank I'm still in the Purple Pill zone where I want to apply these techniques to get me into a stable (or as stable as can be) long term relationship. I've cycled between being applying RedPill concepts. To completely falling apart and losing my frame and cool towards the end of the relationship.

**Summary of Relationship. And What I did right.**

Beginning in the summer of 2020. I was working as many hours as I possibly could've. I was not only in the best position I've ever been financially. But I was working towards actually finishing my apprenticeship early due to the INSANE amount of work available due to lazy bastard on my job site taking furloughs to collect from Uncle Sam's teets.

I was spending time for myself, by myself to also work on a Real Estate investing course I'm working on. More on that later. I spent plenty of time calling my best friend and helping him through his relationship problems, and thus cementing in my own head alot of RedPill concepts. And then while swiping through Bumble I met Rita (not her real name obviously).

Very slowly I vetted her, and at this stage really was not heavily invested. I would schedule a date. THEN SILENCE. She shows up on the date. We have lots of fun, hook up, repeat.

She had me met her family, both sets as her parents were divorced. And I felt like I was on top of the world. Her mom fed me the best home made Italian food. And she was a serial entrepreneur who encouraged and fed me inspiration. As I worked on my side hustles, and real estate ventures.

Her dad a traditional conservative man who pokes at your weaknesses to strengthen you up for the world, but a genuinely honest man who saw greatness in me to be a protector for his daughter, gave me multiple connections he had in the real estate world and directly influencing me towards real estate development goals I had years ago, but put aside simply because I didn't know the area.

Step-Parents (both sets) who are also awesome and thought I was the shit. They themselves were pretty damn cool, for their own reasons.

I honestly thought the approval of her parents, as well as her in the initial phases of the relationship made me impervious to any shit tests, or any storms that would come my way. Make a mistake here or there, whatever. I could course correct. That was my mistake.

**How it Fell Apart. And What I did WRONG.**

**MISTAKE #1 -**

I took 6 weeks off of work to write and film my online course (I finally kowtowed and followed in the footsteps of my brethren and used this time to work on my side projects) This is time I should've 100% EXCLUSIVELY worked on building out this course and FINISHING it so I could start selling before the holidays. Instead I had sex, hung out, and 'fell in love'.... And got SOME work done is what I told myself. This happened all as I justified and rationalized it as being part of my goal of having a family, and that I've been working so hard I should relax!

**MISTAKE #2** \-

I became weak. Women of course have their sexual past, and as much as possible we should shut up and not let it bother us. If it does, we should walk away and find someone who won't disrespect you like that to be talking about her slutty past.

So on halloween she's drunk with her miserable friend of hers (MISTAKE #2.5 Watch out who she becomes friends with, they are either a reflection OR an influence on them), and spent a good chunk of the night talking about a Chad they knew back in the day, and I discovered he got her pregnant... Whoops. Let that slip.

I actually heard this much earlier. But was able to remain calm. Relax I told myself. That's her past, as long as you remain the Alpha in THIS relationship, you're good. You're gonna be knocking her up once you've cemented your real estate empire. HA!

This for some reason bothered me. Maybe it was that plus the combination of the Seasonal Affective Disorder I tend to get during the Fall/Winter months. And throughout the night she noticed I was feeling down. I said it was the beers I had in me or something. I ended taking her up to her room, and instead of just fucking I had to run my mouth and get frustrated over the dude.

**MISTAKE #3 -**

I could've walked away myself and gave myself that dignity. Literally the night before I was dumped. I shit you not I was in the Hot Tub with my friend whom I was giving advice and has a couple of plates himself legitimately contemplating whether I should just walk away.

Then next day bam, I get hit with a ""we're at different stages in life"" talk. Code for I was being a beta bitch and she wants to get fucked by Chad. And that ""I don't know maybe we can be friends, and in 3 years see where we're at"". Code for I want to keep you on the back burner because I know you're gonna be pretty fucking wealthy by that time and I'm gonna wanna settle after LOTS of sex with random dudes in the meanwhile I'm pretending to care about you.

**Reflection.**

The reason why I'm making this is partially a venting tool. But it's hopefully to give someone in the RedPill community that much more of a reminded to NOT LOSE FRAME. Or when shit gets really bad, JUST WALK AWAY. And ironically just walking away would've not only given you more dignity but would've given you that much more power in the relationship.

The other reason I'm writing this is because I recently found her updated Bumble. And it was genuinely the most disturbing profile I've seen in a while. Heres a sneak peak. ""I'm super depressed, what's new 2020??? Dare you to keep me company or give me the best lay of my life your choice. BTW I've got an OnlyFans"". FACEPALM.

If reading RedPill didn't remind me what was happening with her. That said it all. The initial shock really fucked with me. Like hard. But it's been a day and as I'm writing this. I'm more at peace with myself and ready to keep conquering the real estate game and finish what I should've ended a long time ago.

I am planning on reaching out to the Mother and Father in another few weeks to re-establish a business connection with them. It will be strictly business and their daughter will not enter into the conversation.

Frankly the biggest thing that held me back from dumping Rita, was her amazing family. \*(Not a good reason to stay in a relationship I know) So I hope that I can stay connected with them. And this is a reminder to myself that I really am on the right path. And this Rita girl was inadvertently a conduit for my life goals as a man. She actively chose to not be a part of it, but thanks to her I have opportunities I wouldn't otherwise have.

And speaking of opportunities I'm taking even more time off to finish what I should've finished during my last sabbatical. I'm excited for Christmas as I'm hanging out with my best bud and catching the latest Wonder Woman, Tenet, and Soul. And we are NOT allowed to contact a single woman during that day. PERIOD. This Christmas is FOR THE BOYS!

Also, actually the original point of this post was to compare myself to this poor bastard in the MMA world who got dumped by fellow MMA female fighter who was ruthless in her description of why she dumped him, and is subsequently describing why it's so hard to find a suitable mate. I'll leave this here because this post is a dumpster fire anyway. It's a reminder to us that the best of us get fucked by women over stupid shit. Maybe I'll make another post in the future.

P.S. Frankly also please tell me I'm stupid. I need my RedPill brethren to knock some sense into me.

[META] Spirituality and the Red Pill,"Some well known lessons in the Red Pill community talk about maintaining your frame, your masculinity, working towards your goals, and not taking shit or accepting sub-par behavior from the women you are with.

In this post, I want to tie this all to spirituality, which is probably one of the most overlooked aspects in the community that is often just brushed over as an axis of development. This will be a bit more meta, as it will touch on the *context* from which all of your actions and choices should be carried out, rather than the *content* of the actual actions and choices.

We talk about having a path and a purpose, working towards your goals, making women an addition to your life rather than a central focus, being able to walk away at any time, knowing and demonstrating your higher value.

These are all fantastic concepts, but if you try to isolate them and work on them one by one, you cannot really connecting the dots. The underlying reason that makes it instinctively possible to behave that way is to realize that you don't actually need anyone or anything and you never have. That deep understanding will shift your mindset from ""follow rules and fake it til you make it"" to ""it's actually the only rational and natural way to operate"".

**The Four Noble Truths** of Buddhism are the following ones:

* Truth of suffering: **Life is suffering, or more precisely:  life is incapable of being satisfactory.**
* Truth of the cause of suffering: **this dissatisfaction comes from craving, desire, attachment.**
* Truth of the ending of suffering: **the ending comes with renouncement and letting go.**
* Truth of the path leading to the end of suffering: **this describes the path to awakening.**

&amp;#x200B;

Now, before judging this as irrelevant or ""not practical enough"", I cannot overstate how well this applies not only to game, but to everything in your life. You do not have to be ""awakened"" and attain the realization of ""no-self"" (Anatta) to apply basic rules that Buddhism has been teaching for millenia.

**Everything is impermanent**

That's one of the lessons Buddhism teaches you. You have probably heard the Red Pill phrase: ""She's not yours, it's just your turn"". It is exactly the same thing. Your life as a whole is impermanent. **Any idea that you can ""win"" or ""lose"" something is an illusion** (this is very important). When you realize that, you can cut anyone or anything out of your life in a heartbeat. 

The issue is that we tend to **solidify** things. We tend to be in a good situation at some point in our lives, and we want this to be our new **ground**. When it starts slipping under our feet, we naturally want to cling to it. That's the natural resistance of your mind to the flow of life. When you realize that there is no actual ground to you, or to anything in your life, and that anything could change at any point, you are free.

How can you chase a woman when you know you are chasing the illusion of ephemeral pleasure? I'm not saying ""cut women out of your life"", otherwise I wouldn't be posting this here. I'm just saying that: whether she is here or not should never matter. Even if she is a 10 and you have emotionally invested in her for a while.

It's more of the mindset of being happy if you get it and upset if you don't. The goal is just a landmark. The actual game is the fun of it. Detachment from the outcome of the game leads to total freedom.

**Your ego is an illusion**

I have mentioned the realization of no-self. See, Buddhism invites you to find out for yourself that the idea of ""I"" is an illusion. The ego is an illusion. There is no separation between what you consider ""you"" and the rest of the universe. That's probably a bit deep or strange to hear if you have never dabbled with spirituality. But once you understand that, how can any woman, or anyone even hurt your ego?

How can a shit test be successful if the shit test is aimed at an illusion? She is shit testing the ""image"" she has built of ""you"" in her mind. She has built an image of you as some object with a certain number of attributes, and she will test an attribute. If you let here challenge that attribute and take it personally, you will react from her frame. If you see a concept attacking a concept and completely detach yourself from the situation, the power is yours. Part of the reason people fail shit tests is because they reply from an emotional place. ""She hurt me, I have to get defensive or hurt her back"". Everything game is teaching is just a byproduct of the concept of no-self, except it is applied at a specific time, in a specific context, as a drilled reaction that becomes instinctive with practice.

When you neg a woman, you typically hurt her ego on purpose in a playful way, to get an emotional reaction out of her. When she shit tests you, she is doing the same thing, but with the intent of trying to lower your value (or actually, giving you a chance to prove you really are of high value). It's all in a framework of emotion and ego. If you zoom out of it, it's just really funny to observe.

**You are not your emotions or your thoughts**

Coming back to emotions: the only way you can act like an AFC is if you think you have anything to gain from a woman and that she is not giving it to you. You are not your emotions. You are not your thoughts. You should come to a point where you can mentally snap out of any negative mindspace. Total clarity. When you do not identify with your mind, anyone trying to control your mind or manipulate you will simply fail.

So you cannot gain anything, you cannot lose anything, you are not dependent on anyone else. Even the idea of who you are, your reputation, what people think about ""you"", are all illusions. Life is simply a game in that matter. Game is a game inside the game. That's all it is. You can learn the rules ""from the bottom up"", or realize the extent of the whole game and get the ""top to bottom"" picture (you still need to get familiar with the actual, practical rules though).

**If there is no attachment, there is no leverage**

This is true about anything in life. Anytime someone thinks they have power over you, because they can give you something you don't have, you have to come back to this mindset. Anything they can give you is seen as valuable here and now because you are wired to run after material possessions or positive feelings. Detach yourself from these. If you can walk away and mean it in any situation in life, you have all the power. This is only possible to execute in a consistent manner when you have a deep understanding of your inner workings, impermanence, and when you step out of yourself.

Now, this will not teach you about female nature, you still have to understand the ""rules of the game"", which is why the sidebar exists. But this is just to give you a complete, groundless perspective on life. You could be married for 15 years and walk away in a heartbeat. No attachment. Any feelings you have are just a certain type of ""pleasant"" vibrations.

**It does not mean that you should become numb**

All of this is not to say that you have to close yourself off of emotions. You can (and should) ride the wave when it's here. It's the whole fun of the game. This is all to say that when the wave ends, even if it happens in a fraction of a second, you should just accept it and move on. Your capacity of accepting things as they are will make things way easier, whether they work out (you got the girl) or not (she threw a hissy fit and you had to walk away).

In the same way you can ride an emotion, you can as easily detach from it. It comes in very handy in shit tests and any situation where she is trying to elicit a negative emotion from you. Pause, regain clarity, zoom out of the situation, see it as a game, then act.

If you are reading this, I highly encourage you to dive into spirituality, learn about non-duality, start to meditate, and slowly shift your perspective. You'll know your place in the universe, and by definition, she will never know hers (she runs after you, she defines herself based off of you, you become the way she measures herself to her fellow girl friends...). It is the ultimate upper hand you could have, because it operates on an existential level. All the rest follows with practice.",77,1

A Reminder: Negativity,"Put yourself and your vision first, pursue it at all costs with confidence and without hesitation or self doubt. 

Do not let negativity drag you down or make you doubt yourself. 

You are a man working toward the top 1%. You take the risks others are too scared to take, you live the life others are too scared to live, you are elevating to the top, and that‚Äôs why people will try to keep you where you are, because succeeding, turning your life around, challenges their own identities and rationalizations to themselves about why they are where they are. 

Fuck people doubting you, fuck people thinking they know something about you. Fuck people in general. Others do not know what is best for you. People project their internal state on to you when they try to give you their ‚Äúbest advice.‚Äù 

Most people are losers going nowhere who will try to keep you down there with them. Fuck them. 

You know you‚Äôre making progress, REAL progress, when you see the people around you trying to erode your self confidence.

Ignore any and all drama, shit testing, doubting; ignore any and all toxicity to your vision for yourself, and pursue it at all costs without hesitation or self-doubt. 

Your mindset is an iron fortress that deflects the arrows shot by the weak, low-status, and insecure. 

Anybody who brings negativity, fuck off. Anybody who brings drama, fuck off. Anybody who doubts you, or tries to make you doubt yourself, fuck off.

Anyone who wants to distract you from your current focus, your task, your mission, fuck off. 

Ignore all of it. Stay focused.",41,1

Arguably The Most Important Red Pill Lesson,[removed],2,1
Don't Have Kids,"Many RP men still cling onto hope that someday --despite the truths learned from here-- they can hack red pill knowledge to find a good woman, settle down, and start a family.

Nope.

Blind devotion to the goal of having children and becoming a father is foolish, slave-like and blue pill.

Granted, if you already have children or about to have one, this post isn't for you.

First, **women of today are ruined. This doesn't magically change when they become mothers.** They still --maybe even more so-- expect the world to be given to them on a platter without lifting a finger. Even if you find a ""good one"" hypergamy never fails. There's a reason why the guys at Married Red Pill call their life ""RP on hard mode."" Keeping your first officer --ie, your wife/SO/baby mama-- in line as you run the house as its captain is non-stop work. Women aren't naturally good mothers, far from it; they need to see a strong father at work and follow his lead. Even then it's not always easy.

Second, **the current world is against fathers and stable families**. Is it just me or does it seem like wives shout DIVORCE at any tiny thing going wrong, even though it's not the husbands' fault? Why is this world hellbent on separating children from their biological fathers? When your baby mama wants to take your kid(s) and move to another continent, there may be very little you can do. Not to mention the persecution from lawyers, courts, alimony/child support, spouse/child abuse allegations, etc.

Third, **betrayal is like changing clothes for women. It's so, so easy for them to turn against you.** Sure, your woman/wife/mother of your kids can be ""good"" ... for awhile, but they can change their attitude from good to shitty on a dime. One day they might wake up and realize they no longer want you in their lives and they no longer want you to be the father of your own damn kids. This is regardless of how hard you work, how much income you make, and how good of a father and husband you are. They can betray you and their own children instantly. Some might see it as a part of their nature, but I see this as evil and unacceptable, having experienced it first hand. (My own marriage lasted less than a year.)

Four, **don't buy into the lie that co-parenting as separated/divorced parents is not so bad these days.** Let's say you went through a divorce amicably. Now you and your ex-wife, the mother of your kids, are committed to being good co-parents. ROFL! Have you even heard the nightmarish stories from men about their psychotic co-parenting ex's? If you think trying to keep your wife accountable into being a decent mother is hard, try doing that as a divorced co-parent.

Fifth: **Kids are expensive and burdensome.** Mortgage, saving up for college, not to mention you and your wife's (if you're still together) retirement -- along with vacations, cars, the usual bills, so on. It can easily be too much. Add the constant nagging and stress added on by the woman who should be supporting you, not bringing you down. No wonder so many of us are literally killing ourselves. Unless you're making doctor/lawyer/fuck-you money, this will be very, very difficult to manage.

Six: **Having children is rewarding but so are a lot of things.** Sometimes awful people come from great fathers, and vice-versa. I know I'm a big disappointment to my own father since I've decided not to re-marry and not to have children. Living vicariously through your children as they become their own persons is foolish, but I know it's not easy to let them go. Unless your wife/mother of your children is spectacular and you have a couple of commas in your bank accounts, feeling ""rewarded"" by raising kids is like enjoying the best steak in a WW1 trench on the front-lines. Context matters. Being a father and husband is like running a three ring circus and it's constant work with a lot of big, important things not really up to you.

Seven: **You don't HAVE to have kids.** You're not a loser if you're not father. It's okay to live childless--no, childfree. (R slash childfree was helpful for my own journey.) TRP has taught us not to marry, but I'd like to push it further -- Don't have kids. There are other men out there who will, and sure they're probably blue pill. We don't need to be RP fathers; it's not like RP can be passed on from father to children, like teaching how to ride a bicycle. Most of our own fathers were so, so beta, including mine, and yet we've found and embraced being an alpha male. I don't want to hear what culture, religion, or background you're from and how it's important to have kids and be a father-- quit your whining and do not give a fuck. If it's okay to be without a wife/LTR, it's okay to not have kids. Children are not your legacy because legacy is just another lie told to poor, dumb people.

Eight: **When you're old, you're a bitch to your kids.** *When will they call me? When will they come see me? Can I live close to or even live with them? When will I see grandkids? When will my grandkids come see me?* When I'm old, the last place I want to be is in a senior home with aging bitch-ass parents like this. I will have no kids, therefore no longing. I'm not saying it's easier, but that's not how I want to spend the last ten/twenty/thirty years of my life.

Nine: ***Someday I will have kids ... someday... someday...*** **Oh, really?** That really sounds like a blue-pill beta to me, like how George kept the dream (deceit) alive for Lenny in *Of Mice and Men*. Live in reality or keep chasing fantasy. The truth, however, will set you free.

Ten: **Not having kids is amazing for the environment.** Look into it.

Right now I'm forty years old. I have so much I want to do, the excitement sometimes keep me up at night, just like Christmas eve when I was little. Because I'm not married and don't have kids, I have the freedom to do... whatever the fuck I want, really.

Raising children isn't wrong. But what is foolish is the unquestioned, unexamined worship of it, just like believing women are angels. Be critical of your goals and values. Be independent.",178,1
Women in love are the real simps.,"When a woman is completely invested in you, knows your value, and is obsessed with you, she does pretty crazy things.

She‚Äôll catch a flight thousands of miles across, just to see you, out of pocket.

Your needs become her needs. She‚Äôll make sure you come back to a peaceful home, with your stomach full and your balls empty.

She‚Äôll buy expensive gifts for you, even if you don‚Äôt do the same. 

She‚Äôs always down for sex. In fact, she sometimes initiates it. She‚Äôll be a an absolute slut for you in bed, regardless of her history. 

Her schedule is always free whenever you are, she‚Äôll cancel plans with friends just to meet with you, she‚Äôll put your opinion over everyone else‚Äôs.

And I don‚Äôt condone this last one, but she‚Äôll tolerate disrespect towards her, abuse, and even cheating.

Now, let‚Äôs not pretend they‚Äôre doing all this out of the kindness of their hearts, or just because they love you for you. 

She found value, she found a catch, she wants to keep it and she knows exactly how. She does these things because it‚Äôs what gets her feelz going, it validates her.

Even the most frigid, SJW, feminist and gender studying woman will absolutely melt in the presence of a high value man she‚Äôs with. She‚Äôll do things she never thought she‚Äôd do, even unconsciously.

For every man spending thousands of dollars on women who don‚Äôt even know his name, there‚Äôs a woman who‚Äôs source of happiness is to make her man happy.

Why You're Only Making the Matter Worse,"I sometimes check this sub to see if there are high-value posts like there used to be once. 

It's very saddening to see that most posts here are about ""onlyfans"" and the new reality that we are facing.

And yet, most people haven't read a marketing book in their lives and don't understand that the way companies grow is not through paid advertising, but through social media. 

In fact, the highest quality companies spend very little on paid ads and focus their efforts on creating high-quality products and services. But how do they promote what they sell? Well, social media.

And don't make the dumb mistake to think Reddit isn't ""social media"". It fucking is and it's becoming even worse than Facebook day by day due to the capitalistic goal of their shareholders. 

What am I trying to say? I'm trying to say that talking about how onlyfans destroys our fantasy of purity in women won't change shit. And it's only making the matter worse and I'll tell you why.

Even if most people here are not the target market of those websites (simps), there's always a small percentage of people who see your post called ""OnlyFans blah blah"" and, without knowing what OnlyFans even is, are going to visit that website and understand what it is about. Then what? Then they'll start simping. 

**But isn't this what we DON'T want?** Don't we want it to end? Don't we want women to become great again? Then why the fuck are you doing free funneling services for that fucking website? Do you want to make that pimp CEO even richer? 

Do you think the CEO of that company sits behind his screen and talks about how slutty women are? No, he's too busy fighting in the REAL world. He's winning, we are losing. And understand that, because if you can't accept this reality, then this sub should be renamed to ""TheBlackPill"" cause that's what it looks like lately.

If you are pissed off about the situation, do something about it. But don't whine because that won't change shit. You'd be better off visiting their HQ and killing the CEO, the co-founders and erasing all the database, and put the HQ to fire. That's the only real thing you can do to change the situation. 

By talking about ""onlyfans"", you are feeding their system. That's exactly what that company wants. It wants attention, and more attention. Because where's there's attention there is money. 

And yet, guys here don't get it. 

Why don't you spend that time building yourself? 

I get it, it's a fucking shame to see this reality. But isn't the Red Pill's goal to become more stoic? And isn't stoicism about stop trying to control things we can't control?

And if you really wanted it to end, you motherfuckers would put $10 each and would hire a professional team of hackers to destroy all the databases of that website. 

But you won't do that cause you are in the anger phase and the only reason you keep talking about this shit is that you can't stand this new reality. 

I recommend you read *""This is marketing*"" by Seth Godin. Companies grow when people talk about them. And that's exactly what you are doing, without realizing you are making YOUR problem even worse than it is.",24,1

Social media is cancer to your life: A simple philosophy to become a tribe builder instead of a lone wolf.,"**Summary**

Literarily everyone in our western culture has in some shape or form a sense of being alien to our society. We want to connect to people around us but we don‚Äôt. It is often said that the way to the top is a lonely road. But that‚Äôs only said by lonely people and it conveniently fits their lone wolf mentality. Become a tribe builder everywhere you go, and you will live a good life, an experienced life, a powerful life. These are your first steps to unplug yourself, to open your eyes.

**Body**

1.

Our reptilian brains are not adapted to our metropolitan world. We‚Äôre out of date models and we‚Äôre hungry to hunt, hungry to build shelters, hungry to trek, hungry for a band of brothers. But tribal life is never coming back and city life has its benefits, among which, a high volume of women to spin. The one true test on your heroes‚Äô journey, in becoming who you are, to shed your boyhood and become a man, above all you must learn how to build and lead tribes.

2.

Call your mom, your brother, your sister. Stop hiding behind your rectangles. Shed your passive frail consuming mentality and start engaging with the world around you. The number one key to become a tribe builder is to become assertive, to take initiative, to act instead of react, to tune in the with the creator within you. The path to become superhuman is laid stone by stone. If a simple phone call makes you feel uneasy, here‚Äôs your first stone. Make a habit of calling family and close friends instead of texting them. Make a habit of greeting people and dogs on the street, greet the hobo, greet the cashier, greet the bartender smoking outside, greet the hiker, greet the old lady feeding pigeons, greet the guy next to you on the bus, greet everyone next to you in the gym. Call your mom again.

3.

There are four key activities that mold men into brothers: chasing girls, globetrotting, friendly competition and dining. They all generate wealth in its purest form: power. For millennia, the status a man has in his society is build and reflected by the women he fucks, the places he travelled to, his athletic strength, and the men who dine at his table. Western culture has almost entirely lost touch with the last one. But it‚Äôs a powerful thing, to feed someone. Dining has been the backbone of many societies and it‚Äôs easy to see that men in societies who still maintain that tradition have stronger relationships with family, with neighbors, with fellow men in town. If you‚Äôre looking for some motivation to learn how to cook (looking at you who only eats microwaved junk): lifting will help you master your body, cooking will help you master your network. Make a habit of inviting a friend over for dinner on any given boring worknight. Everyone is bored. Everyone is tired. Everyone has to eat. Girls in our society have mastered the art of brunching for an hour from the age of 16, it‚Äôs not that fucking hard. Dining is the easiest way to bring people together. Bring people together. People will admire you.

4.

You‚Äôll spend your 24 hours and you‚Äôll spend it on what you planned to do. If you don‚Äôt plan shit, you‚Äôre planning social media, or cheap shitty entertainment. Get busy. Cram your days to the point snoozing simply isn‚Äôt an option. The bare minimum on any given day should be: 7 hours of sleep, 8 hours of work, read 10 pages, sport 30 min, meditate, work 1 hour on your next passive income stream.

5.

Lift, yes, but find a team sport too. Don‚Äôt know where to start? Call your brother or sister. Ask a friend to go for a run tonight. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be a close friend. You‚Äôll be amazed how many guys go running alone and would love to find a running pal. Every universities offers a wild range of sports where you can tag along and get to know many great people. In Europe, you don‚Äôt even have to be in university to join the sessions.

6.

You become an adult when you realize there‚Äôs no such thing as adults in this world. You become a social guy when you realize everyone is awkward and most people remain awkward until they die. Most lonely guys I know always tell me the same crap: ‚ÄòNo one ever asks me to go anywhere.‚Äô Make a habbit of inviting people to dine, sport, go for a walk, go shopping. It doesn‚Äôt have to be planned. Just call when you‚Äôre on the way.

7.

Your life only begins when you figure out everything you do together, you can do alone.

8.

Your life is outside. Or did you really think that one day staring at this rectangle in front of you would become life-fulfilling?

9.

If you take away the rectangles, how many rooms did you visit in the last week? How many people did you actually have a conversation with? Social media is cancer, the illusions they give us of being in the world are paralyzing, utterly soul-destructive.

10.

When you have your own life outdoors, meeting people comes naturally, inviting people to come along comes naturally.

11.

If there are no people in your life, it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt have a life. Go outside. Create a life. It is the only way.

12.

If you don‚Äôt know what to do: be bored. Sit on a chair and do absolutely nothing. Sometimes it can take ten minutes, sometimes half an hour. But when you move you will understand that anything is better than getting a quick shot of life through the eyes of a movie character or social media. Creating a life is hard. It‚Äôs difficult. But the smallest creation - like getting out of your fucking door, fixing your bike or cleaning your shoes ‚Äì can be bliss if you see it for the greatness it is.",132,1

A guy felt devastated after seeing old videos of his fiancee having kinky sex with her EX. People shame him for feeling bad and try to convince that the girl didn't enjoy it and was forced.,"I shit you not, some of the comments are hilarious. 

[https://archive.is/qKN7M](https://archive.is/qKN7M)

Long story short, EX of OP's fiancee shared some of their consensual sex tapes with somehow kinky sex. OP said that to him she obviously enjoyed the act and received strong orgasms (he assumed this based on physiological reactions you can't fake). When OP wanted to do similar things with the girl before, she rejected him and said she doesn't enjoy things like that. It made him feel like shit because a prude girl who only gave him some boring vanilla sex was a real nympho with her EX. With this sad story he goes to RA sub, but instead of compassion for him people feel bad for the girl, most comments are about ""revenge porn"" and the rest are about how she probably was intimidated and faked all her reactions. People literally would rather believe that she was abused than that she enjoyed kinky sex with one guy and didn't want to have it with another. This is just some next level of delusion and self-deception. They didn't see the videos, but OP did and he knows this girl really well, and yet they doubt his judgement and even SHAME him for feeling bad about it or wanting to have more kinky sex with her.   


Here is the narrative that society pushes on men to make them accept the girls who decided to settle after their ""stupid girl"" phase.  


"" The part about her not wanting to do certain sex acts with you or her saying she doesn‚Äôt enjoy them rubs me the wrong way. Just because she enjoyed them at one point or seemed to enjoy doesn‚Äôt mean she has to do them with you.  ""  


Even when caught red-handed, a girl can always make an excuse that she felt pressured and just faked enjoying this. There is also something that people miss. If a girl is really into you, she'll fake feeling good even if you are really bad in bed, she'll accept your fetishes even if she isn't into them. What they see as ""being honest and open"" is just the fact that a girl isn't invested enough to care if you leave her. They are right, she definitely feels safe with him, safe that he isn't going to leave her for someone else even if he isn't satisfied sexually or emotionally. **So why should she even try?**",147,1
"The reason your turn ends, sooner than later. Or, how women try to rob you of your value.","Women are like water, slowly eroding at the rock that is the man until it crumbles, and then their water flows to new rocks.

AWALT, they will ALL try to make you change. They‚Äôll soften you up, try to spend a lot of time with you, shit test you, and every now and then pull some bullshit to see how you react.

This isn‚Äôt a guide on how to keep a woman. Instead, ensure you are the type of man that women want to keep.

In my experience, the main factor that leads to the end of the relationship, be it short or long term, is how much value you‚Äôve let her rob you of. 

You‚Äôre in top physical shape? Diet on point?

She‚Äôll tell you how much muscle doesn‚Äôt matter, she‚Äôll cook you calorie rich food, she‚Äôll avoid complimenting you on your progress.

You‚Äôre confident, assertive and full of yourself?

She‚Äôll shit test you, make jabs at your self esteem, especially during arguments. Not to break you, but to see if you‚Äôre actually as unbreakable as you present yourself. 

You have a rich social life? Hot female friends that make her feel threatened?

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt spend enough time with me‚Äù, ‚ÄúCut them all off‚Äù. If you follow any of these orders she barks at you, consider yourself castrated, as you‚Äôve handed over your balls on a silver platter. 

The longest, most fulfilling relationships I‚Äôve had, where the girl was infatuated with me for years on end, were ones where I didn‚Äôt lose what made me attractive in the first place. 

The ones I got cheated on in, the ones where I got monkey branched, where ones in which I did everything she wanted, where I became her ‚Äúideal‚Äù version of me.

And spoiler warning, her ideal version of me wasn‚Äôt exactly getting the pussy wet.

You don‚Äôt need to be perfect. Nowadays the average man pays to see shitty nudes, follows 100 Instagram models, and is his girlfriend‚Äôs dog.

A healthy body, confidence, mixed in with a little bit of narcissism and ego, and you‚Äôre a cut above. 

And if(when) your turn does inevitably end, if you kept building your value, you‚Äôll come out of it better than you entered, and you‚Äôll have no trouble finding another.",71,1

Love is real but it's meaningless,"**She swore she didn‚Äôt drink at work, but she called this her downward spiral, so I always wondered.** She‚Äôd get nervous when it was closing time at the liquor store and she was running out of wine. By three in the morning, she‚Äôd tell me she loved me.

I dismissed this as drunk talk. I knew she‚Äôd never remember. It felt vapid. This wasn‚Äôt love, this was mind-blowing chemistry, code that girls on dating sites use for ‚Äúhot sex‚Äù- her face would blush with orgasm. This was a momentary connection so deep that the coalescence of energy between us felt tangible. Even if it were only temporary, the reality of it carried a gravity so strong it held us to the bed.

And even if she were only a year older than me, she was tuned into a frequency that I didn‚Äôt yet understand.

[**\[EXCERPT FROM: NEVER CALLED ME BACK\]**

_______
**Lesson:** She was right- she did love me. Love is real, and it exists in glimpses and flashes, temporary lapses of judgement, regret and guilt, and love for family- and, always, it is *only an emotion*. An emotion to enjoy or struggle with, but one that must always be put in perspective. Allow it to inform your choices, but understand that it should never have the final say.

Tonight's subject: **how to avoid being roped into shit you don't want to do.**


-------



For those unfamiliar, we are running a ~biweekly call in show where we talk a specific subject but welcome any callers. 

#If you're reading, submit a question. You'll do a lot better than askTRP. 


----------------

For those not familiar with the channel, we're working on producing voice and video content that's a bit more in line with TRP.

""Red Pill"" has been co-opted by a lot of morons who would be laughed out of the sub, especially the YouTube ""redpill men"". /u/rpu_mike and /u/RealJoeDee have been covering a lot of the sidebar in a new format through RP University, and doing interviews with various relevant characters and the occasional EC.

This show will be interactive to the extent we have questions that follow rule zero, with hosts working directly with call ins.

The general theme of the show, much like the radio shows before us, is the RP way to deal with sexual strategy, having a good time, and otherwise the degenerate shit you get into when you're out playing the field.

Look forward to seeing you there. Live at 10pm EST.",3,1

Old wisdom,[removed],2,1
"What the story of, ‚ÄúThe Beauty and the Beast‚Äù can teach us about women, and about ourselves.","I‚Äôm sure at one point we‚Äôve all talked to that one girl who just absolutely loves Disney movies. It sometimes gives off rather childish vibes, but it is often a topic I instigate further when brought up. A women‚Äôs favorite Disney movie can tell you a lot about her.  Just bear with me here for a second.

When I ask this question to the women who tell me that they love Disney movies, the two most common responses are The Beauty and the Beast, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, with the latter being less common.  Whenever I ask them to explain just exactly why they love these movies so much, every single time they fail to explain why they do. They just ‚Äúdo‚Äù.  

I‚Äôm a firm believer that we are able to pick up the themes of these stories subconsciously, which can have a deep impact on us while simultaneously not necessarily being aware consciously what the message being relayed was. Let‚Äôs take Snow White and the Seven Dwarves for an example. If you were to ask someone (who likes this movie) why they like it, a typical response would be ,‚ÄùI like fairy tales with happy endings‚Äù, or ‚Äúit‚Äôs a good story that reminds me of my childhood‚Äù. If you were to ask them what the story of Snow White means, the usual response is very literal. They take the themes of the story and translate them very literally and often all you‚Äôll get in response is a simple run down of the story.  Many are shocked to find out Snow White is suppose to represent virginity, and the seven dwarves represent her own seven sins. Snow White is fighting against her own demons so that she can maintain her purity and land ‚Äúthe one‚Äù. 

Beauty in the Beast is special to me because it absolutely nails a women‚Äôs motif, and it shows a lot of what a women subconsciously wants, despite failing to consciously describe it. 

A very quick rundown of the story for those unaware, it‚Äôs a story about a princess named ‚ÄúBelle‚Äù, who is constantly courtship by a well looking and muscular hunter named Gaston, but the princess instead falls in love with a man who looks like a wild animal living alone in a castle. When they fall madly in love, the beast turns back into a prince and they all live happily ever after yada yada ya. 

Many will tell you this story is about how you shouldn‚Äôt judge a book by its cover, or how you should love someone for who they are and not what they look like etc. and while technically they are right, they fail to really hit the nail on the head. Belle is a representation of femininity. She‚Äôs soft, beautiful, loving and caring. She is the projection of the girls watching the film/reading the story. The Beast represents masculinity. Strong, powerful and hairy, like a wild animal. Primitive and raw. Untamable and uncontrollable. Think Iron John, King Kong, or a wild male lion. The other man in the story, Gaston, is a fake representation of masculinity. The ‚Äúwarning‚Äù signs they need to look out for. He‚Äôs a fraud. A predator looking for his prey. He‚Äôs not a ‚Äúhunter‚Äù by accident. Think of Gaston as a man metaphysically killing your inner beast. These are the men that will get passed up. Instead, the women want a man who is masculine. They want that wild fuckin animal. They want the dangerous man, who has the killer instinct, but knows how to control it. A man who is not afraid to get violent when the time calls for it. The wild Lion sitting up top his throne. A dangerous creature that even looking at it behind a locked cage will give them the tingles they desperately search out for.

What they want is to be the one who can tame this inner beast. They want this big, hairy creature to hone in his abilities. And they want to be the soft beauty that this hairy beast falls in love with.

You need to get in touch with your inner beast. Find this masculinity within yourselves and learn to hone in its abilities.",27,1

The Wall really does remain undefeated...,"There's a lot of stuff you can read about here on TRP and understand to a certain level, without having to experience it for yourself. It helps you to prepare for situations before you encounter them personally, allows you to learn wisdom that previous generations have passed down by a male mentor, and has (no doubt) saved any number of guys here from getting their fingers burned terribly by some of the tough realities other guys learn the hard way. And for that, we should always be thankful for TRP as a tool. And yet-

It's one thing to read about different subjects here and understand them, but another to experience it for first-hand and feel the gravity of it actually taking place in your world. 

It's one thing to read about depression and another thing to wake up one morning not wanting to go to work or even to get out of bed- and legitimately not caring about the consequences- or anything else for that matter. 

It's one thing to read about approach anxiety and how to beat it, another thing to see a random girl in public who makes you heart skip a beat and immediately go mentally blank about what to say to her and realise that your only option is to go up to her and try initiating conversation with zero idea what's going to come out of your mouth, how she is going to respond to what comes out of your mouth or what anybody else within earshot might think about you approaching a random girl like that.

It's one thing to understand abundance mentality, but another thing to know you should cut a girl whose company (and all it's benefits) you really enjoy, even though in doing so you realise all those things you like about her are going to become nothing more than memories and you don't have any other prospects on the scene at this moment in time.

It's one thing to talk about faith and understand its' principles, another to actually make that leap into the mist and hold your breath waiting to see how you land on the other side.

Likewise...

There was a girl I liked back in high school we'll call Shannon. I won't bother describing her because it's not really the point, but needless to say Shannon was that rare combination of beauty and raw sexual appeal. On top of that, she was feminine and pleasant with nice manners. The kind of girl any respectable parent would have as first pick to babysit their kids. While she was aware that plenty of guys liked her, she seemed oblivious to *why* that was, maybe still scarred by the guy in junior high who told her she should wear a bag over her head? 

I liked her and (looking back) I realise now there was a window of time in senior high where she was interested in me- but alas I was too much of a pussy and too clueless to act. I let that chance slip away (haven't we all been there?) and even though I got over her soon, I still always found her massively attractive. 

I'm now well into my 30's and I can only lament the other girls like her over the years (ones who I fancied but failed to get/ ones who fancied me but I was never fussed about/ those ones I fancied and actually had a chance with but ruined due to any number of reasons) with years of experience, hindsight and the wisdom shared here. Even now, sometimes I think back to those more innocent days and think ""Man, if only I'd played things differently/ not been such a pussy/ known then what I know now...."". 

Cut to today and I'm at the mall, walking along and then amongst that crowd of Christmas shoppers I recognise Shannon straight away. I see her, but she doesn't see me- she's chatting with a woman she must know from somewhere. As I glance at Shannon, I see she's put on weight now. She's not *fat* as such, but solid-looking and this stuns me because in her youth she was petite with a delicate frame. She got snapped up in her early 20's. Married. Had a couple of kids. I would still go there if the opportunity arose, perhaps more for old times' sake than anything else? Yet in those brief few seconds- as I walked right past and then (further on) glanced back her way again- it was surreal and curiously bittersweet-

Because back there was the girl who (without being too graphic) I have probably fapped to the thought of more than any other over the years when going back through the old masturbatory mental catalogue...perhaps as much for the ""one that got away"" factor as for the beauty of her youth. And yet now, while still attractive, she just looked like any number of other 30-something housewives after they've popped out a couple of kids...

I walked away and almost felt *bad* for her. 

Because regardless of how beautiful she was, how sexy you found her, her personality traits or suitability for a LTR- their physical beauty fades as the years go on. The wall remains undefeated.

Even for Shannon...",35,1

Spend idle time to work out who you are and what you want,"Monk mode is a popular concept in this sub. It allows you to find out and work on your mission, self reflect and grow individually. It is a necessary process as a man.

But too many distractions exist today which means dudes don‚Äôt do any real self reflection in their daily lives. I think that is because firstly, they are afraid of what they will find, and secondly, it is too easy to watch Netflix or scroll social media or spend time with your plate/gf.

You need to spend time going into your emotions and thoughts to work out the kinks and pathologies there. If you don‚Äôt you will be constantly running from your shadow (shout out to Jung) and falling into traps set by your own subconscious.

Get into your heart and belly to unkink your emotions and analyse your behaviour daily to work out who you are and why you behave the way you do. Once you work this out you can go about your day so much more relaxed and confident in the knowledge of who you are, what you‚Äôre about and what you want. You really need to do this or you‚Äôll be lost, running in circles.

Spend time navel gazing on the couch with no distractions and really get into yourself. You‚Äôll find that your mission could be quite simple and achievable and has little to do with what you‚Äôve been told by others.

I‚Äôm thirty now and I know what type of seducer I am (read Art of Seduction), what my general needs and wants are and how I am when I am totally relaxed and flowing. My confidence has never been higher. This may be due to age but I think you can work yourself out much earlier than 30.

Another proverb to really take on board is ‚Äútension is who you think you should be, relaxation is who you are‚Äù. Once you are relaxed you can truly fucking crush your life.",27,1

Be honest about your lifting goals and stop fucking around with powerlifting routines,"If there's one consistent piece of advice on here, it's that every man who is unhappy with his sex life needs to lift, and lift heavy.  No argument there.  However, the advice usually stops short of prescribing specific routines, principles, and methods other than 'lift heavy, lift often'.  

It took me a long while to realize this:  **if you're primarily lifting to look good naked (be honest, that's most of us on here), stop doing pure powerlifting routines!**

Now, I have nothing against beginner programs like Starting Strength or Stronglifts - that's how I got into the iron game.  But one thing you'll realize after doing these routines and eating a caloric surplus is that, yeah you might get significantly stronger after 6 months of lifting 3x per week, but a lot of the know-nothing dudes doing bro-splits still look better than you.  What gives?

The harsh realist is that if your goal is to look good naked, you have to focus more hypertrophy than pure strength.  They are not mutually exclusive, but the training methods differ a lot, once you get past the pure beginner stage.  

One of the best coaches that I've learned the most from is [Paul Carter](https://archive.is/OdFty).  He has a no-BS style of writing and coaching, and a killer IG, that has gotten me much better results.  Some of the key points he talks about that I've found most helpful:

**1)  Mechanical tension drives muscle growth** - if you want muscle growth, push your sets near failure (except on squats, deadlifts, and other compound lifts where form breakdown can lead to injury).  You don't have to go to failure all the time, but you should be within 1-2 reps in reserve most of the time.  Stop thinking 'how many sets should I do' and think 'how mf'ing hard can I push this set?"".  See [intensity extending techniques](https://archive.is/8UEqH) for more details.  When you push each set to the absolute limit, you only need really need 2 hard work sets to spark growth.  You can also look up Doggcrap training for a similar philosophy.    

**2)  Volume only drives growth as long as it's not junk volume** - doing tonnes of sets of 1-3 reps at heavy weight is fine if you're trying to build 1RM strength.  This type of training generates strength through neuromuscular adaption.  But if you're focused on muscle growth, the sweet spot is 8-12 reps (upper body) or 12-20 reps (lower body) to drive growth.  Over the long term, you want to be lifting more weight for more reps.  Simple enough right?  High effort reps are your friend.      

**3)  You can build muscle equally well on lighter, moderate, and heavy weights** - technically you can grow muscle with weights as low as 30% of 1RM but that would make training pretty fucking boring as you'd need to do a metric fuckton of reps to hit failure.  The sweet spot is a weight where you can crank out 8-12 reps (and on occasion 12-20 reps) to failure.  Again, this rule is not to be applied to compound lifts with a risk of injury like squats and deadlifts.  But it works great for leg press, bench, leg extensions and leg curls, and all types of upper body work.  

**4)  Stop being afraid of carbs and eat big if you want to get big** - seriously if you're not gaining mass eat more.  Hit your protein targets first (start with 1 g per lb of bodyweight), and figure out your carb and fat split using an online macro calculator.  Focus on clean high quality carbs like oatmeal, rice, and vegetables.  Protein converts to adipose tissue (body fat) very inefficiently, so prioritize that first.  

**5)  Learn to love machines** - barbells are great... if you're training for a powerlifting meet.  If you're not training for a meet, stop putting a barbell up your ass every single workout.  Cables and machines have their place too when used correctly - and frankly they are far more efficient for targeting specific muscle groups than a barbell.  Examples:

* The standard bench press is a shitty chest developer - try the guillotine press, dumbbell chest press, cable crossovers, and a pec fly machine if you have it and see how sore your entire chest is the next day.  Soreness is not a gauge of progress of course, but you will feel a much greater mind-muscle connection when you diversify your movements.

* Not everyone is built to benefit from squats - if you have shitty ankle mobility, valgus knee, a deep acetabulum, or an unfavorable torso to leg ratio, you will not get as much benefit as someone who has a good structure for squats and is able to get deep and stable hip and knee flexion.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing single/dual leg presses, hack squats, and leg extensions.  Dorian Yates famously remarked that his legs didn't really grow until he stopped squatting.  You absolutely DO NOT need to squat to get big legs.

* Deadlifts are an ego lift - if you sumo deadlift this is especially true because sumos are designed for maximum leverage.  That's NOT what you want when building muscle.  Conventional deadlifts are good for hamstring and glute development, but the recovery curve is pretty long.  A better alternative is the romanian deadlift, preferably with a trap/hex bar.  And don't forget doing the seated leg curl with a [10-6-10](https://archive.is/CBL7n) rep scheme.  Welcome to a whole new level of pain.

When I started this, I thought that doing more reps per set, and using intensity extending techniques like drop sets, 10-6-10s, and rest-pause, would kill my recovery.  But the opposite was true:  once I started focusing on getting the maximum effort out of each set, but doing fewer sets, I felt much fresher for each gym session.

Bitches everywhere is not an excuse to be a bitch,"All women use their charms one way or another to get something (IG thots, corporate suckers, waitresses, everyday life, etc.).

It's not a matter of being a prostitute or not. It's a matter of degree of prostitution.

Obvious prostitution is not respected by society because it biologically disturb it.

Still, even at the highest degree, female hustlers make money, then marry, have children and are fine in the west:

[https://www.instagram.com/lovialongtime/?hl=fr](https://www.instagram.com/lovialongtime/?hl=fr)

[https://www.instagram.com/candicehorbacz/?hl=fr](https://www.instagram.com/candicehorbacz/?hl=fr)

The world's oldest profession will continue to normalize and there's nothing you can do about it. No amount of shaming will restore anything. High n-count has already been standardized, the conversation is already ""why are you insecure about your high n-count wife getting dicked down in her corporate onlycam job to help with the bills?"".

Still, we shouldn't use those facts and BS excuses like ""they don't get much money anyway"" or ""they will pay for it later"" as revenge porn/excuse for our inner beta. The hard truth is that thots botter you because they either don't suck your dick or their life is easier than yours.

We should focus on ourselves instead of being bitter and wanting life to be fair. We need to be cold and pragmatic, adapt, pursue what we like, improve our SMV, be redpill aware, fuck bitches and choose wisely if we want a family.

You can have your cake and eat it too. Yes you hear me, you can fuck (empower) a lot of bitches, then have a family (very hard mode activated in the west), and fuck on the side (public service), or one of those.

No one knows what will happen in the future but there's no need to worry, because all roads lead to strong men.",24,1

Interview with an OnlyFans girl,"https://youtu.be/Fay6parYkrw?t=123

This podcast was pretty long but I thought it might be interesting to some people. It was a bit eye opening and tells a lot about what is going on behind the scenes and how pathetic our fellow men are:

Synopsis: A very pale 6.0 / 10 pretty average girl starts up an OnlyFans. She earns $14,000 a month for doing 3 hours of work per day. She mentions how powerful she feels to have ""money at her fingertips"". She elaborates on numerous strategies she uses to manipulate men. You can tell from the background that she just moved into a new home funded from all the simp chump money that is rolling in.

She makes slightly more money than my day job (I made way more as an investor though). I spent around 50k on education including 4 years in postgraduate school, 14 years of hard work(50-60 hour work weeks with minimal vacation), and numerous promotions.

I am in the top 5-10% in terms of income and net worth. In comparison, an average-looking pale THOT can jump on OnlyFans and immediately earn more money than a top tier male wage earner.

That blows my mind. I can only imagine how much a 9.0 or 10.0 is earning. I think this is the stuff people regard when they talk about the life of a woman being in easy mode.",268,1
The Habits of Heroes - Pt.1,"This series is going to cover the red thread of habits that most of successful people have. After a decade of reading about self-development, setting lofty goals, and chasing my own ideals, I have found patterns that are common to all dream chasers. But first we need to talk about habits in general.

# Intro to Habits

Habits are actions that are repeated over, days, weeks, months, and years. As you continue to solidify your patterns, it will over time become a part of your personality. A good sign of a solid habit is the feeling of emptiness when the habit is missing from your day.The myth is that habits take 21 days to form, this is not accurate. The scientifically backed number is somewhere around 66 days, of daily repeated behavior. **This can take as long as 8 months depending on the particular habit and your personality**. We need to take into, account that we are all a bit different from one another.

# The Boring Stuff

&amp;#x200B;

*Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going. - Jim Rohn*

&amp;#x200B;

Three years ago I got a flash of inspiration - I was going to learn illustration. In my passionate state, I could only see all the fun and upside of becoming an artist. I decided it was one day going to become my main source of income.

I started my research, finding artists, good books for beginners, etc. I was hit with reality. **It takes anywhere from 5 to 10 years of daily drawing to reach a professional level.** Those that did it in less than 5 years -  invested 4 hours a day to illustration. Reaching out to artists over the web one comment stuck with me - ‚Äú**The fun stuff comes later.**‚Äù

Becoming a solid illustrator requires tons of hours hammering on the fundamentals. We are talking about drawing a thousand boxes in different perspectives, practicing straight lines without a ruler, endless circles, and ovals.

It‚Äôs basically a grind and the reason why so few reach that technical proficiency be it programming or in my case - the arts.My point is this - we all want the ability and skillset but so few are willing to put in the grind. In almost any area of life, you will find fundamentals, does not matter if it‚Äôs a physical or mental pursuit. **And the fundamentals are usually incredibly boring**.

The good thing is that once the months and years pass you will with increasing frequency enter the flow state, where you become immersed in your action. The fundamentals are meant to get ingrained in you, like a reflex. The initial awkwardness of being a novice will diminish. A new habit is hardest at the beginning of your journey. After that it‚Äôs an upwards spiral of progress and skill.

# Showing Up

The great part about cultivating a habit is that you in the beginning only need to show up. Get the mind used to your new activity. My disillusionment with drawing made me only sit for 10 minutes a day, this went on for well over a year. Most people would have quit - but I never let go of the bigger picture. **It sucks to suck at something, but that‚Äôs how learning something new works.**

&amp;#x200B;

*Discipline is choosing between what you want now and what you want most. -Abraham Lincoln*

&amp;#x200B;

**Like with anything else in life you will have bad days.** That is the most crucial time to get a habit ingrained. Even if you don‚Äôt progress in your field you will at least maintain the skill you have cultivated so far. Think of the mindset you have in lifting, the bad days will be there but you still put in the time.

# Time Management

In a recent book, I read the author mentioned something called - The 2 Minute Rule. You show up and work for 2 minutes with the intention that you will stick for longer sessions once you get over the initial resistance of doing a hard or boring activity. I really think this is overkill and underestimating the average joe.

&amp;#x200B;

*‚ÄúDrop by drop is the water pot filled.‚Äù -Buddha*

&amp;#x200B;

I personally use the Pomodoro Technique which involves working 25-minute sessions followed by a 5-minute break. **What are 25 minutes right during the entire day, right?** That‚Äôs the magic of Pomodoro, once you are done with the first round you find that you can easily do another one, again, and again. The benefits of Pomodoro are that the round and break allows your concentration and focus to be sustained for longer work sessions than if you worked for hours on end. A sidenote - it is especially useful if you are studying a topic.

# Environment

**During the Vietnam War some soldiers indulged in heroin and opium.** When they got back home 9 out of 10 had kicked their habit. They returned to their old environment and associated with peers which did not use drugs. \*\*It goes to show that environment and what type of people we surround ourselves with is stronger than the most addictive drugs known to man.\*\*You want to set up your environment to be conducive to what you are learning and practicing. I have a separate illustration table which is super messy with art supplies and sheets of paper everywhere. **But I get started practicing in seconds**. My mind has already associated sitting down at the table with illustration. It will make it that much easier to get in the mindset of work.If you have space, set of various parts of your room for different tasks. The living room might be set up for home workouts, another corner of the room might be for studying. Apart from my illustration table, my bass guitar is literally within reach right now, and I can get playing in no time.

# Habit Chain

You want to develop a system you go through each day, which involves a set of habits in successive order. **Your day might start with a workout, then proceed to practice your chosen field, then write, etc.** Self-development authors often call these *your daily rituals*.Doing this will prepare your mind for the various modes it will enter each day. World class fighters usually have their fight late at night in Las Vegas, the fighter has his workouts late at night in order to make sure he peaks in endurance and strength at the right time. The mind gets prepared for the fight. **You want your habits to take place at the same time and in the right order every time.** I first read about this from a Yogi called Sivananda in regards to meditation.

# Seinfield Method

I could have called this section ‚ÄúHabit Tracking‚Äù but I am going cover one of the easiest and simple ways of cultivating a daily habit - The Seinfeld Method. For those of you who don‚Äôt know who Jerry Seinfield is, he is a comedian popular during the 90s.

**In an effort to improve he used a calendar and decided to show up each day and write jokes, it didn‚Äôt matter if they were good or bad. The key was to just show up.**

&amp;#x200B;

*Successful people are simply those with successful habits. -Brian Tracy*

&amp;#x200B;

You keep a calendar where you put a red X for each day you showed up to grind. After a few days of this, you will have a chain, and you will get motivated to keep going and build on that chain, you will have a momentum going. Place the calendar where it‚Äôs visible - the bigger the better.By following this method your resistance to doing the work will diminish. Also, small improvements over time are said to have a ‚Äúcompounding interest‚Äù which means it will develop into large improvements.

# Written Mission Statement

This is your list of goals, review it every day. Preferably in the morning.  The thing is after, weeks and months of grinding it is incredibly easy to lose your vision and the bigger picture, the thing that inspired you in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

*Happiness is a habit‚Äîcultivate it. -Elbert Hubbard*

&amp;#x200B;

This paragraph is going to become too woo-woo for many here, but I am including it anyway. Many successful self-development speakers have talked about getting the universe on your side in reaching your goals. It is incredibly simple just make your goal or ideal as clear as possible and make a mental image of your desired state or goal, now fuse it with positive emotions.Continue to cultivate a positive mental attitude and emotions during your day. Make it a game.The theory behind this is that we are living magnets that attract situations, and people in our lives. Both negative and positive depending on the individual.

# Conclusion

**I read somewhere that it takes 5-7 years of daily practice to become top 10% in your field**. This assumed you also read books in your field for about 30-60 minutes a day. This might seem like a long time of hard work, but the truth is that you will get accustomed to the workload and habits, they will become a part of you. And another great thing I want to mention is that once those years have arrived you will have transformed as an individual. You will have cultivated qualities and traits that are way ahead of what your average joe is. ",22,1
Women have plenty to be ashamed of,[removed],0,1
"Why acting ""Dark &amp; Mysterious"" makes you look like a beta bitch.","**You're not hot enough for women to hamster themselves into STILL liking you.**

First of, let me just cut the crap and get the Incels out of the way. Yes, women will make excuses for your shittiness if they think you look good looking or powerful enough, in order to still get you to fuck them. This goes from every single characteristic that people find shitty: virginity (he is saving himself for marriage / hasn't found the right one yet), baldness (wow he looks like vin diesel / the rock), being poor (oh i dont mind it its current year and we dont really need money to date) and appearing introverted and closed up (he is simply dark and mysterious). Et cetera, et cetera. **They hamster themselves into wanting to fuck these men because they're so high status to them it literally does not matter. They convince their pussies that these guys are still fuckable.**

This is perfectly fine and how the world works. Contrary to popular belief, Red Pill acknowledges this fact of life: the miniscule minority of guys will have girls practically simp over them in order to keep their pussies wet and ready because that is simply what they do for men who are (to them) **unicorns**.. but, you're not a unicorn. I know that because you're here instead of drowning in pussy at every corner so you CANNOT pull the shit the guys that look way better and are in a way better status than you CAN.

Red Pill works, and it applies to men. The only men which it doesn't truly apply to are unicorns: men 9 and above facially, who are hella tall and w/ big status. Even guys who are 7s or 8s (a pretty damn great place to be in) cannot get away with doing dumb shit; unless you really like fucking fat and ugly chicks because to them you are a unicorn and, again, flawless. So, don't try it. Realize that being dark and mysterious is vaginal since..

**You put yourself in the mindset of a woman.**

Think about it: **how do women attract men?** Are they forward? Are they bold? What do they do and say? Do they go up to a guy and start flirting? The answer? Nothing; most of the time. They put themselves out there, appearing dark and mysterious, letting men enjoy in their gazes and MAYBE one of them will approach and take her home for the night, or spark a conversation that gets her tingles going.

And on the chance no one comes? Well, they were just doing some other things unrelated to finding a man. Obviously, they didn't come there to flirt with anyone. Nope. They were just there, showing off indirectly, so nobody got rejected. Then, they can tell themselves ""well.. at least I appeared dark and mysterious and stoic, how good of a quality is that, perhaps some of them thought things about me"".

While, sure, this is safe practice and doesn't have the risk that approaching does.. it carries major risks on its own in other forms. The girl in the story is looking for a hard dick to pound her pussy, so I'll ask you a question.. do you want to take a big dick up your tight most-likely-waxed bussy; or do you want to get pussies wet and have women wanting to jump on your cock? If you want the first part, hey, feel free to keep lifting, being dark and mysterious and dropping a soap in the showers when a gaybro acknowledges your sxy physique. If you want the latter, being dark and mysterious has the lack of a risk; and it doesn't make women horny. What makes women horny is..

**Bold and forward masculinity creates a great contrast between a woman's shifty and dodgy femininity.**

Observe the reality and tell me: **who do women tend to fuck with?** The men who are introverted and shy? The guys who just sit by the sidelines with hands in pockets and don't flirt or make moves because it's gonna fuck up their coolness? No. They fuck LOUDMOUTHS. That's right. Guys who are funny, who make moves, who take risks, slide into DMs and who don't care about being mysterious. Guys who do shit that makes Red Pillers cringe; but at the end of the day they reject the fact that these men FUCK. And not only do they FUCK; they fuck enough to be considered in a CATEGORY.. fuckboys. They make fun of them and talk shit; then suck their dicks and bend over behind closed doors. Then they age past 25 and starts crying about how these men are just awful, wishing their cuck beta husband can still fuck the pussy the same way but I digress.

**Men aren't (and shouldn't be) mysterious.** Men who are mysterious are often less mysterious and more men with insecurities and/or lacking in something. The most attractive thing you can do is this: improve the fuck out of yourself to your best ability and then show them with pride ""this is who I am"". Let these women know that you're going to fuck the shit out of them and have their tingles go haywire. If you have it, you show it. If you don't, you turn to mystery. But, no. You don't show it. No, you want to be stoic. You want to be COOL and just DGAF about bitches and tricks. Well, I'm here to tell you that..

**You care way too much about holding your frame.**

Finally, the last point but CERTAINLY not the least: you put your frame above everything else. Men who believe in D&amp;M tend to be the ones who are extreme about frame holding. I've seen it plenty. Got disrespected? Someone threatened you? A guy sat to your table and told your girl that you're a sissy? Hey.. at least you still held that frame; yea? At least you did something that you can take home, like a participation trophy, and consider yourself a winner.

But, truthfully, what makes a man is the complete opposite. I'm going to tell you something controversial that completely breaks the most basic Red Pill principle but which is so true: **being able to not give a fuck about your frame at times yet still keeping it is the most attractive thing a man can do.** Think about it. If you go through your life always caring about your frame.. your frame is weak. Picture this: two men with each having a brand new phone in their hand. This phone is their frame, and their display of status. The men are asked to throw their phones into the distance, and if they don't they have to pay the person $50 (or he will pay them $50 if they do). One man tells him that he is crazy, that he just got the phone, that he can't afford to throw it; and pays $50 to stop the risk. What does the other man do? He throws it, the phone breaks, he gets $50 and spends way more than that to repair his phone or to get a new one. Question: which man looks of higher status to you? The man who was too afraid, poor, thinks about risks involved and succumbs to the pressure.. or the man who has so much status and money he can just do that shit and still be thinking ""now what?"".

So, stop giving shit about your frame too much and appearing a certain way. If you cannot break it or rebuild it then you never really had it. There's a time and place for frame holding, and I'll make a separate post for it one day.. but as a man, it is your DUTY and obligation to throw your dangly frame mach 5 up against the wall, go for it, take the shot, make yourself look silly.. and still have your frame there. Without a dent; or at least with an ability to rebuild it as a man.",33,1

Fake It Until You Make It,"**The Natural**

The most authentic and true ‚ÄúRed Pill‚Äù men are not on the internet trying to find reasons why they got dumped. They are not familiar with such terms as ‚Äúabundance mentality‚Äù or ‚ÄúOneitis‚Äù. They aren‚Äôt sitting around pondering exactly how to respond to a text, or coming up with a strategy on how to approach women or get them to fall in love with them.

These men are *Naturals.* They don‚Äôt go to the gym because some sub-reddit told them to lift. They don‚Äôt need to be told to STFU because their instinct already tells them to. They have never heard of the term ‚ÄúDEER‚Äù because the thought of DEERing would never even enter their minds. I could go on, but I think you get the point. Or do you? 

The very fact that you are reading this post, (and that I am writing it), indicates that we are not *Naturals*. We are here because we have noticed trends in relationships in our lives that we are struggling to understand. Why does the nice guy finish last? Why do the assholes get and keep the girl? Why did she leave me even though I treated her like a queen? 

**The Internal Conflict**

I see so many posts from angry men struggling to comprehend the full magnitude of relationship dynamics. They are very angry at women, for simply being *their true selves*. Women are the epidemy of what it means to be red pilled. It is biologically hard wired into their DNA. They exhibit these behaviors *subconsciously*, without even thinking, similar to the way the *Natural* does. Sure, there are some girls out their who are completely vicious and calculating with their manipulation, but that is the exception, not the rule.  They are natural manipulators.

Too many men on here demonize and objectify women. I am guilty of these at times as well. This is not healthy. *Women are not the enemy*. We are our own enemies in this battle. Once we learn to quell the internal conflict, we can take steps to truly understand the nature of relationships. Not only between men and women, but between every human being. 

**Figuring It All Out**

One method that was very helpful to me, was to understand what influences in my life made me the way that I was. For me, my father was a true beta in every sense, and I was raised in the dogmatic teachings of the church which shunned sex outside the confines of marriage. I was raised, much like others, to search for *The One*, *the Unicorn*, marry her and have kids and live happily ever after.  Every girl that I dated became *The One*, until she was not. 

You must conduct this self analysis to identify the root influences in your life that have affected your relationships.  Once you have done this, you can take steps towards re-wiring your brain.  You must fully accept the truth, i.e. swallowing the pill.  So many of you put the pill in your mouth and cheeked it.  You cannot progress without having the full understanding of biology and the effect that it has on every relationship dynamic.  

**The Importance of Abundance**

You cannot truly understand the reality of *The Natural*, or women in general, until you experience abundance.  Women have it simple in this regard. I would say with reasonable certainty that any average looking girl can go out and get fucked any night of the week and twice on Sunday. Even below average looking girls could spread their legs and be more successful at getting laid than an above average looking guy. Women don‚Äôt put all their eggs in one basket. There is always another option. It‚Äôs left to them to swing to the highest branch.

*The Natural* has it pretty easy too. By his nature, he has women flocking to him. Even when he has a dry spell, he doesn‚Äôt give a fuck anyway. True abundance mentality cannot be achieved until you have actually experienced it. It doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. Once it does finally happen, you can truly not give a single fuck when one of your girlfriends gives you shit. There is always another option. And even when there isn‚Äôt, you know what it takes to add another horse to the stable.

**Conclusion** 

Some of us are closer than others to naturally exhibiting red pill behavior. Others have a long way to go. There is no light switch that you can flick that will magically give you these qualities. Even if and when you do obtain these qualities, you will have to continue *faking it until you make it*.",128,1

The goal of the Red Pill isn‚Äôt to wake everyone up,"The Red Pill isn‚Äôt for everyone. It‚Äôs an open minded personality trait that is probably the best predictor of you being here.

The red pill is for bitter people at first. The ones that got their happy reality shattered. Most of the time it‚Äôs some girl that caused it. You search for answers to the questions you were left with. Turns out normal people won‚Äôt answer them, or will even judge you for asking them. Some people really try to find answers and they find trp among others.

When you get red pilled you learn to see an unmediated reality. You learn to see through hidden agendas and fragile societal constructs. Instead of living by other people‚Äôs ideas, you start living by your own.

The red pill teaches you to be selfish instead of selfless. To stop suppressing your own needs and instead learn to take whatever you want. To stop having fear and anxiety rule your life. To stop supplicating to other people and act like you‚Äôre at the top yourself. Soon afterwards authorities and rules are things of the past too. 

Most of the time power comes from people giving you power. For them to give you power requires them to be Blue Pilled. The more selfless people the better. They so desperately seek a leader figure.

The blue pilled people do the most work in the world. They need to believe they are compensated appropriately for the effort they put in. They need to need to work to obtain the validation of others. They need to believe all their work needs to be worth it in the end. They need to give and consume.

Let them live their delusion while reaping the benefit. If their delusion shatters they risk becoming unproductive losers. Maybe black pilled being the closest description. If they become Red Pilled they will only end up being competition. The less competition the better. Society would fall apart if everyone become a selfish parasite. 

The knowledge you obtain from red pill like communities holds power. And power doesn‚Äôt always have to be shared.",90,1

"The Prince &amp; the Magician - from the ""Magus"" - John Fowles","Once upon a time there was a young prince, who believed in all things but three. He did not believe in princesses, he did not believe in islands, he did not believe in God. His father, the king, told him that such things did not exist. As there were no princesses or islands in his father‚Äôs domains, and no sign of God, the young prince believed his father.

But then, one day, the prince ran away from his palace. He came to the next land. There, to his astonishment, from every coast he saw islands, and on these islands, strange and troubling creatures whom he dared not name. As he was searching for a boat, a man in full evening dress approached him along the shore.

‚ÄúAre those real islands?‚Äù asked the young prince.

‚ÄúOf course they are real islands,‚Äù said the man in evening dress.

‚ÄúAnd those strange and troubling creatures?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are all genuine and authentic princesses.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen God also must exist!‚Äù cried the prince.

‚ÄúI am God,‚Äù replied the man in full evening dress, with a bow.

The young prince returned home as quickly as he could.

‚ÄúSo you are back,‚Äù said his father, the king.

‚ÄúI have seen islands, I have seen princesses, I have seen God,‚Äù said the prince reproachfully.

The king was unmoved.

‚ÄúNeither real islands, nor neat princesses, nor a real God, exist.‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw them!‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me how God was dressed.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod was in full evening dress.‚Äù

‚ÄúWere the sleeves of his coat rolled back?‚Äù The prince remembered that they had been.

The king smiled.

‚ÄúThat is the uniform of a magician. You have been deceived.‚Äù

At this, the prince returned to the next land, and went to the same shore, where once again he came upon the man in full evening dress.

‚ÄúMy father the king has told me who you are,‚Äù said the young prince indignantly. ‚ÄúYou deceived me last time, but not again. Now I know that those are not real islands and real princesses, because you are a magician.‚Äù

The man on the shore smiled. ‚ÄúIt is you who are deceived, my boy. In your father‚Äôs kingdom there are many islands and many princesses. But you are under your father‚Äôs spell, so you cannot see them.‚Äù

The prince returned pensively home. When he saw his father, he looked him in the eyes. ‚ÄúFather, is it true that you are not a real king, but only a magician?‚Äù The king smiled, and rolled back his sleeves. ‚ÄúYes, my son, I am only a magician.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen the man on the shore was God.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe man on the shore was another magician.‚Äù

‚ÄúI must know the real truth, the truth beyond magic.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no truth beyond magic,‚Äù said the king.

The prince was full of sadness. He said, ‚ÄúI will kill myself.‚Äù

The king by magic caused death to appear.

Death stood in the door and beckoned to the prince. The prince shuddered. He remembered the beautiful but unreal islands and the unreal but beautiful princesses.

‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI can bear it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou see, my son,‚Äù said the king, ‚Äúyou too now begin to be a magician.‚Äù‚Äù",4,1

You must first be content with yourself before all else.,"You cannot truly be considered a man until you‚Äôre content being alone. The incredible advancement of technology in this century alone has created a world of people chasing the next dopamine high whether that be from eating junk food, addiction to social media, pornography or excessive drinking and partying. Whilst many enjoy this fast-paced lifestyle, it can lead to a problem where you‚Äôre neglecting both your physical and mental health. Take away all electronic devices from the average person and they‚Äôll be thinking ‚Äúwhat the fuck do I do now?‚Äù. Why read a book when you can watch a video on YouTube? Why learn a language when you can binge-watch Netflix all day? Why cook a healthy meal when I can just get a delicious cheap one delivered right to my door? The removal of these devices leaves the average person feeling empty. They‚Äôre suddenly alone with a person they have failed to put the necessary amount of time and effort to; themselves. 


I first came across this realization a few years back when I started delving into stoic philosophy. Stoicism was an eye opener for me and I strongly recommend every man to delve into it a little at the very least. Too often are we consumed by the thoughts of others, what they think of us and how to impress them; but do we ever put that much time into working on ourselves? The body that you live in is the body that you will die in. It will forever remain with you until death so why neglect it? There‚Äôs a reason why the manosphere preaches heavily on lifting. With each gym session, you are putting effort into your body, making it stronger and chiselling a physique that you can be proud of. Your subconscious is always watching and when you put in the work, your self-confidence and body will thank you for it and you‚Äôre ever more equipped to deal with the next challenge in life.


Many if not all of us here have been victim to the biggest killer of a man‚Äôs sense of worth; oneitis. Catching oneitis for a girl is a heavy blow to a man as you suddenly place your time, thoughts and energy into this girl. This girl now becomes the highlight of your life and if you‚Äôre one of the unfortunate ones, your value of living is worthless without her. It shows that you are not content being alone and definitely shouldn‚Äôt be pursuing any relationship. Your happiness lies with this girl and not within yourself. Why should a single woman out of the 3.9 billion in this world have that much of an impact on you? When you‚Äôre comfortable being alone, the next woman that comes along will not affect you in a significant way regardless of the outcomes and in a sense, builds up on the abundance mentality. You are living your own life with your own goals and purpose and nothing can stop that train. 


The COVID-19 Pandemic is a prime example of the lack of contentedness of being alone. Suddenly girls weren‚Äôt having their phones blow up as usual and the attention and validation died down. Being stuck in their rooms as a result of the lockdowns have left them alone in agonising boredom with no idea on what to do next. It‚Äôs no surprise that we‚Äôve seen a major increase in suicides during this pandemic. Hell, I would be suicidal too if I didn‚Äôt have a purpose anymore. But instead, I created a new purpose during the lockdown. I started learning French, I started doing calisthenics in my room, programming, reading into philosophy and all sorts of things. The pandemic was a blessing for me; I suddenly had an abundance of time and I utilised it correctly to better myself as a person.

Now how do I unplug from this world and find peace within myself? If you really feel dissatisfied with your current position in life, monk mode is the best way to start. Unplug from social medias, you‚Äôd be surprised how much better you‚Äôd feel when you don‚Äôt have politics, celebrities and advertisements thrown at you constantly. Call people instead of messaging them. I‚Äôve had people tell me they find it weird that I call them instead of texting but also admit they really liked the phone call. Make a habit of doing mindfulness meditation, stick to it for a month and I‚Äôll pay you ¬£100 if you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs had a positive impact on your mental health at all. Keep your physical exercise in check, no excuses. Discover new hobbies; it‚Äôs a great way to meet new quality people. Once you are truly content with yourself, there is no problem in life that you can‚Äôt handle.",49,1

"Meet the Belle of Solipsism, the empitome of the females TRP warns you about","Belle Gibson was an Australian woman who, simply by using her looks and knowing full well the kinds of things people, esp certain kinds of men Love to hear and talk about giving her hamster the workout of it's life in this interview.

[`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCN2Uvyz72k`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCN2Uvyz72k)

The interviewer is an Aussie 60mins reporter who covered Belle's bullshit before, and she gives no quarter in this interview. In fact being female she's well aware of Belle's 'moves' and is merciless. Yet Belle kinda DGAF!

it's been said that Belle's hamster looks more like a small Staffordshire bull terrier, the muscley little fuckers they are!

Beth was/is basically ""a typical HB on Instagram in 2016"" with a following a 2-300k subscribers, many who were her ""orbiters"" that sent her 'gifts' and 'donations' as the video will explain

However, behind those sweet brown eyes is a sociopathic liar. You will see this often on the video. The reporter catches her out over and over, it's cringeful

What I think makes it even more scary as she's not very smart, she's just 'pretty' and 'cute' and 'adorable' etc which = credible and she knows and uses this to her advantage. And still she was able to pull all this off with 'charm and lies'!

And I'd guess at least 70% of her audience are male. You know the kind.

Just to give you an idea, I forget how many IG followers she had but *even  after she had been  exposed*, she still had 250k+ followers ***who still believed her!***

This female is ***everything TRP teaches you to be aware of and avoid!***",20,1
She'll never forget a good neg,"**She was the kind of girl who had every guy in the room gawking at her wherever we went-** dark hair, large breasts. She was the hottest girl in the club out with a kid in a Misfits t-shirt.

She‚Äôd never had known I existed without the internet.

I was too invested emotionally to compete with her game playing, but like the drug dealer in an after school special- she gave me a taste and I was instantly hooked on the kind of emotional warfare that would define all of my future relationships.

I did my best to keep up with her. **I wrote taunting poems accusing her of being emotionally dead and kind of fat (she wasn‚Äôt) while implying that I was fucking another girl in her absence. This bought me a few more hook-ups, but I was ultimately out of my depth. Still, she‚Äôd remember the poems years later.**

When you start down a road of emotional manipulation, you end up an addict. You get hot for the process. Coming up with jabs and tuning into the subtle reactions that she thinks are hidden. When you find a sore, you pick at it. You‚Äôll end up getting off on this harder than you get off on sex.

**[Excerpt from: [CHUBBY SET OF BONES](https://killtoparty.com/2019/10/05/chubby-set-of-bones/)]**

**Lesson:** Get good at teasing and make it your number one weapon. Do not listen to anyone who says ""negging is played out""- **a man teasing a woman is eternal.** It demonstrates superiority, comfort, confidence, outcome independence and so much more. Land a good one and she'll remember it *forever*- I've heard from women *years later* who'd jokingly bring up an off-hand comment I made that rubbed her *just enough* the wrong way and stuck with her. 

Never forget this.

Getting Laid a Lot Requires You to be ‚ÄúCreepy‚Äù,"Most guys who are starting out do everything they can to avoid the seemingly-terrifying label of ‚Äúbeing creepy‚Äù. Dudes feel like their entire world will come crashing down if any girl ‚Äì or anyone in general ‚Äì perceives them to be ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù or ‚Äúweird‚Äù.

I have news for you: You can‚Äôt get laid a lot without making it your number 1 goal &amp; hitting on a large number of girls. That will mean you inevitably creep a few girls out along the way; after all, talking to girls you don‚Äôt know and trying to have sex with them isn‚Äôt exactly socially normal. Therefore, **you cannot get laid a tonne whilst completely avoid being creepy.**

Let‚Äôs define creepy: *‚ÄúCreepy is you doing something I personally think is weird or wrong or inappropriate, according to my own subjective opinions and preferences.‚Äù* You see, creepy is pretty damn subjective. It‚Äôs a value judgement someone makes on you/your behaviour; it depends a hell of a lot on that person‚Äôs preferences, current mood, relationship status, personal hangups, how their life is going at that point in time, etc.

In the context of talking to women, creepy usually means the girl just isn‚Äôt interested in you (unless you do something really stupid like lick your lips whilst saying, ‚ÄúMmm girl, Daddy wanna eat you all up, buttercup.‚Äù) Hell, even then, some girls would be into that.

And that‚Äôs my point. What seems ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù to one girl is ‚Äúconfident‚Äù and ‚Äúspontaneous‚Äù and ‚Äúcharming‚Äù to another. My roommate puts it best: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not possible to get laid without creeping some girls out, because there‚Äôs such a broad range of things that could potentially creep any one girl out.‚Äù

**People have preferences, likes and dislikes** ‚Äì you‚Äôre going to gel with some girls but not with others. Some girls will love your personality and your traits, your manner of talking, the way you look‚Ä¶ while others will think you‚Äôre the creepiest motherfucker in the world. **And that‚Äôs perfectly fine.**

I message one girl on Tinder &amp; ask if she‚Äôs into BDSM and wants to give it a go; she calls me a massive creep/pervert. I copy-paste the exact same message to the next girl, who says, ‚ÄúOh my god I love your forwardness. I‚Äôm very curious to explore that actually.‚Äù Nothing changed *except one girl was into me/what I was offering, and one girl was not.*

Here‚Äôs a perfect example. My Tinder bio is, *‚ÄúWhen I was little, girls hated when I pulled their hair. Funny how some things change.‚Äù*

Word for word here's how the conversation went: 

&amp;#x200B;

*Her: Hey! So does the bio line work on many girls? I must say, it made me giggle*

***Me: Hah, it works on the fun ones ;)***

*Her: ahahah, I showed it to my housemate and she said you were a creep, but I was pretty into it* 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up having sex with this girl, by the way ‚Äì including a 3some with another one of my fuckbuddies. [Proof is here](https://killyourinnerloser.com/clown-girl-woody-allen/).

So one girl thinks I‚Äôm a massive creep, but another loves me for it and has sex with me. Exact same bio, two very different reactions.

# A Caveat‚Ä¶

Obviously if you‚Äôre getting called ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù a lot, it may be your appearance. If you‚Äôre overweight or dress horribly or you smell really bad &amp; walk up to girls and tell them they‚Äôre sexy ‚Äì you‚Äôll get a lot of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre creeping me out‚Äù.

If you want a lot of lays, you‚Äôre going to have to walk around checking girls out constantly ‚Äì pretty much non-stop. You‚Äôll have to become a guy who‚Äôs thinking about sex all the damn time ‚Äì which some people may think is ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù ‚Äì otherwise you‚Äôll never have any kind of solid sex life. Big goals require you to go all-in and not hold back.

You‚Äôll also need to be more up front and assertive on Tinder/online dating ‚Äì if you want a lot of sex, you cannot afford to have your time wasted with long conversations that don‚Äôt lead anywhere. You‚Äôll have to be a sexual guy online as well. Some girls might think that‚Äôs ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù, and that‚Äôs perfectly ok. Let them think you‚Äôre creepy; those girls aren‚Äôt worth your time anyway.

Hell, even if all you‚Äôre after is a loyal, decent girlfriend ‚Äì you‚Äôll still have to go on dates and make the first move most of the time (girls aren‚Äôt forward ‚Äì it‚Äôll be up to you to hold her hand, to kiss her, to try to have sex with her, etc). Sometimes you trying to kiss a girl will creep her out a bit. That‚Äôs totally normal ‚Äì it‚Äôs par for the course. Embrace it and learn to be ok with it, because at the end of the day, ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù is just a label.

If you‚Äôre hitting on girls in person, you‚Äôre also going to have to get over your fear of having other people hear your conversations. It‚Äôs inevitable other people will see you chatting up girls out on the street if you do it enough times. Some of those bystanders may even think you‚Äôre weird for doing it ‚Äì they‚Äôre usually just insanely jealous of you. But in all my approaches, and all my friends approaches, nobody ever had the balls to actually walk up to any one of us and say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being a creep‚Äù. So let the haters hate from afar, sitting there watching you and stewing, wishing they had the courage to do what you‚Äôre man enough to do.

# I Used to Worry About the ‚ÄúCreepy‚Äù Label too

I used to be fucking terrified of being ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù, especially as I used to do a lot of my approaches on one particular university campus. I had to talk to a lot of girls before I got over that fear, and I realised I was fabricating this wild story that if I ever got called creepy, my whole world would fall apart. Over time I learned to let go of that irrational fear and just get on with my goal: sleeping with girls &amp; enjoying my life.

These days I‚Äôm the creepiest cunt ever. When I get a number off a girl in person/on Tinder, my first text is, ‚ÄúDo you have experience with being submissive/BDSM, or is it something you‚Äôd like to explore?‚Äù That‚Äôs pretty damn forward, and so I‚Äôve been called creepy, gross, perverted, an abuser, etc quite a few times. It never feels nice (after all, who wants to be insulted?) but it‚Äôs MORE than worth it to have fun and meet a lot of really sweet, really interesting, really awesome girls.

I still get called creepy to this day ‚Äì who gives a shit. A woman who calls you creepy probably isn‚Äôt all that happy with her life ‚Äì healthy girls don‚Äôt insult strangers they barely know.

# The Takeaway

If you truly want to meet a bunch of women and get laid, date them, etc ‚Äì you‚Äôre going to need to be bold. It‚Äôll be up to you to initiate and make the moves. It‚Äôs inevitable that sometimes girls (or bystanders/other people) will think you‚Äôre being creepy; it‚Äôs all part of the process. You need to not only accept it, but fully embrace it.

I give you permission to go out there and risk being called creepy.",112,1
"I became the best version of myself, but am depressed and sad","This isnt the place for it, im aware, but asktrp is all about memes now. Retards who didnt read the sidebar, troll on the posts and get trolled on the comments. So I figured I'd come here.


Im 20, 1 year of trp, 6'6, 210lbs (religious lifting for 1 year), ~9% bf (ectomorph), good looking, nofap (1month+, relapsed sadly), dont drink or smoke or do drugs, good grades at top 5 college of my country and internship in a famous regional company. Still looking for a solid purpose.


Read both sidebars, The Rational Male, NMMNG, Sex God Method, Meditations, What Everybody is Saying, Book of Pook, 48 Laws of Power, and so on...


My problem? Im lacking pussy, and dont know where to get it. I lost my vcard this year, fucked twice and thats it.


My body (I can dm pics of it) is the classic stereotype of what girls want, I just dont have good chest/abs: broad shoulders, insane quads/calves genetics, fat ass and ""v""/big back with big traps.


With braces, rubber bands and grooming, my face became attractive/masculine. Not handsome but enough to make girls horny.


Posture fixed through lifting and self checking make me look like a god. I walk looking slightly upwards and using a lot of space. It demonstrates confidence. I FEEL confident and well walking like this.


Yet, I programmed myself to not believe a chick is into me unless she approaches me. And that never happens, we all know it, unless youre giga chad. They'd kill themselves if they were rejected.


""Why not approach tho?"" ""Why not try OLD?""
I dont feel anywhere around ""enough"" for it. Buffer, ik, but if I were to get rejected, I'd probably feel even more like shit in the situation I am. Not for minutes or hours, but probably days or weeks. Also its easy to be recognized again when youre this tall. Besides, I know OLD might just fuck my self esteem because im not giga chad in terms of face.


And to bury me even more: got blood work done recently and discovered im actually low on T (504). T, which is our life force, responsible for making us make girls horny, for whatever the fuck a man does that he's supposed to do well, is low when im super healthy at the ""apex"" of it (teens to early 20s, which is supposed to be around 1000. Lol).


I feel like a pile of shit. What must I do? I dont want to be a bitch. I dont want pity. I want useful advice. My parents think my diet gets me stuck on the bathroom shitting. They have no fucking clue im having silent mental breakdowns crying there daily. I dont want to give up on this pain, I want to be strong enough to face it.

4 TRUE Traits That Alpha Males Have,"I've recently read plenty of misconceptions as to what ""being alpha"" truly means.

*""An alpha male is someone who helps others, has a good heart, and makes improving people his mission!""*

Bullshit. 

Morals and opinions are not what determine the ""alphaness"" of a Man, your most depraved and evil people in history are categorically alpha, while self-sacrificing do-gooders can easily be classified as betas.

Does this mean be evil? No. You can have a good heart and be an alpha male, however you must understand being good is not a requirement, or even a trait of being an alpha.

***

Being the *""Top Alpha Male,""* or the *""Bottom Beta Bitch""* is not something etched into the stones of eternity -- often times such a position is contextual, or situational. You can have a large gathering of men who all have *alpha traits,* like a meeting of Business Executives, but the ""Top Alpha"" in that situation is the Man all the other men are listening to. Just because they aren't the alpha in that situation, doesn't mean they don't have alpha characteristics at all. Another example would be, at your local weight gym, the Top Alpha is the guy who can lift the most heavy shit or the most muscular dude, but throw him into an MMA gym, and suddenly he may very well be thrusted into the middle, or even lower echelons of that environment's hierarchy, by virtue of being able to have his ass kicked. He still has alpha traits, but in that situation, he is not the top alpha.

***

I keep alluding to *""Alpha Traits,"" or *""Beta classifications,"" and the reason for this is one you should take to heart throughout your Red Pill journey -- We use Alpha/Beta as easy to remember terms to label a type of man, but that is only short hand for its true meaning; the classifications of behaviors and tendencies. 

No man is a Beta. They have a high number of beta characteristics.

No man is an Alpha. They have a high number of alpha tendencies.

**The 4 TRUE Traits That Alpha Males Have**

**1.) An Alpha Is A LEADER** 

Whether you are leading peasant farmers in a revolt against the world's strongest Empire or leading your high-school sports team to victory, a true marker of alpha-hood is when other men (or women) are willing to follow you and obey you. Hate to break it to you, but there is no goddamn such thing as a *Lone Wolf Sigma Alpha Male‚Ñ¢.* Alpha's and Beta's exist in sort of a Yin &amp; Yang situation where one cannot exist without the other contrasting it. In other words, *Alphas and Betas operate within Male Social Dominance Hierarchies, if you do not participate in any, that simply makes you an outcast.*

You may be able to get girls, or have the other traits of being an Alpha, but if you are not leading people in your life or bending their wills to your own, then you simply lack this trait, and that's fine too, because remember that being alpha is not a concrete personality type, it is a synthesis of many traits, if you don't have one you can have others.

The trait of leadership is fairly easy to measure. When you say you are going to do something to your friends, do they insist on doing it with you? When you tell your woman you do or do not want her to do something, does she follow your lead of keep doing her stupid shit? At your work, are you giving orders or are you taking them, how high on the chain of commands are you?

**2.) You Invoke Feelings Of RESPECT, Of FEAR, Or BOTH, In Other Men**

How many times have you laughed at the guy who claims he is an alpha male while watching him get blatantly disrespected? Take a skim through askTRP and you'll see what I'm talking about.

*""Guys I am a 100% certified alpha male but my best friend fucked my girl-friend. How can I reassert my dominance?""*

In situations where both those feelings are lacking, but people disrespect you, then you should take some solace in the fact that they at least see you as a man, even if you're perceived as a *beta man.* 

When you don't invoke any feelings in other people, not even disrespect, that is because they view you as a child. Nothing of noteworthy importance -- an insignificant non-factor in the Social Dominance Hierarchy.

(First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they hate you, then they envy you, then they celebrate you.)

When you have men informing you how much you inspire them, or how much they want to be like you, they admire you and your accomplishments unprovoked, or they are inviting you to their events because they feel you would bring valuable contributions to the meeting, you have their respect. When men question their own actions because out of worry for how you might react, when they go out of their way to hide their failures or shortcomings from you, when they always kiss your ass in your interactions, you have invoked their fear in you. Both of these feelings are a sign that you are on the same level of the social dominance hierarchy at worst, or many echelons higher at best.

**3.) An Alpha Male Does Not Care About What Other People Think Of Him**

There are so many true to life examples of this trait, and I know the lot of you aren't going to like some of them.

The drug dealer who runs the streets, ignoring the haters that call him a low-life thug, has this alpha trait whether you like it or not.

The fat neckbearded gamer, who doesnt care about social etiquette or being in shape, has this alpha trait whether you like it or not. He may lack every single other alpha trait in the book, either out of laziness or he just doesn‚Äôt have what it takes for the rest, but he has this one, the true ""IDGAF"" mentality.

It is not an Alpha trait to do what is good and virtuous, nor is it a beta trait to do what is bad and base. To understand the alpha-ness of your actions, you must simply question whether you do it because it is what you genuinely want to do, or if it is because that is what other people have lead you to desire. If it's the latter option, then in reference to the very first trait, you have let other men lead you, thus making you a follower.

This trait is difficult to ascertain, and should be assessed on a case by case basis.

If you are a 9-5 office working, doing it because *""it's the right thing to do for my family, and my wife wouldn't approve of the job I really want to have even though I'm good at it,""* then you're a certified beta male, for letting other people determine your own life path.

If you're in a garage band because you think it's the best way to get girls and you want other guys to see you as cool, you are a certified beta, because you are putting on a performance only to invoke reactions and validations from other people. Once again, you are letting what other's think of you determine your actions.

Now on the contrary, if you're in the band because you love music, you're good at it, you love performing in front of crowds, and the groupies and fans are just a bonus -- Alpha as fuck.

If you Work in a 9-5 office and love it because you've realized it's an easy, effortless, sit on your ass all day job, and you've figured out how to spend half of it being paid to surf the internet without getting caught -- Alpha as fuck.

This one is the most difficult to ascertain for it is a measure of a man's mindset.

**4.) Alphas Can Defeat Other Men In Combat**

Whether it's play fighting to showcase your MMA skills to your friends, or thrusting your bayonet into an enemy's chest in the heat of battle, my most personal true indicator of an Alpha Male is the ability to defeat other men in combat.

To take this theory to its logical extreme, how can you claim you are more Alpha than another guy when that other guy fucking capped your ass?

*""Oh he doesn't have emotional control so he had to resort to violence. I am a stoic alpha male while he is a murdering beta.""* Whichever way you spin it, all the justifications and rationalizations go out the window when you're fucking dead, and he's not. 

In the case where the violence doesn't resort in death, but rather a fight, the same still applies -- all your justifications go out the window when you get knocked out by another man, even worse when it happens in front of your girl. There is no quicker way to get cucked in front of a girl than getting your ass whooped in front of her.

Of course, there is always someone bigger and badder than you -- but once again, being the Top Alpha is contextual and situational, and you can still have an abundance of Alpha Male Traits despite not being the top Alpha in a particular situation.

Three examples to help illustrate this idea:

When two Professional Cage Fighters meet in the ring to do battle, their ability to destroy an everyman, and even most trained warriors in combat, is indisputable. However, in all wars there will only be one victor. When the dust has settled and you see which fighter is covered in the blood of his enemy, that is when you've found the Top Alpha Male... 

...Of that particular meeting of warriors. Fight ""A"" might be the top Alpha when compared to Fighter ""B"", but he has not fought Fighter ""C"" yet, therefore when they meet, they must fight for dominance yet again.

That's right, *Alpha males fight for dominance.* Look at any animal in the kingdom and you'll see the biggest men essentially trying to kill each other to establish control over the territory or the bitches. You think us humans are any different? Okay, we may have other traits that would make us alpha, but to forget one of our most primal traits of alpha-hood is to live in inebriated ignorance. 

Back to the examples...

In a team of Navy Seals; all professionally trained killers, often their squad commander will ask his mates for an assessment of their current situation, and ask for opinions  on how to proceed with the mission.

The captain's squad-mates will all give their input, but ultimately the captain will make the final decision on how to proceed.

They are all trained killers, and any one member of that squad could potentially kill any other individual member in combat, however the Top Alpha male in that situation is the Man the other Alphas are being led by.

The last example of this trait is if you are a scrawny nerd but have a gun, it doesnt matter how many years the other guy has lifted, how much time he spent fighting -- if he does not have a gun, you are the alpha in that situation. That may change if the gun falls on the floor, but, until then, keep your distance and you'll be in control of the situation -- i.e. the contextual alpha male.

***

**CONCLUSIONS &amp; CLARIFICATIONS**

I want you to make note of one VERY crucial factor all these traits share:

**ALL THESE TRAITS HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH WOMEN!!!**

If you've been paying attention, every single trait of being an alpha male is all in relation to your standing with other men in the social dominance hierarchy.

Some may say *""well isn't getting laid by hot women an indicator of being alpha?""* And I would contest that it is merely an indicator of your attractiveness. It is worth noting that having Alpha Male traits will make you much more sexually attractive to women, however women are often gullible and terrible judges of character, so they can sleep with some horrible characters that are not very alpha, and disregard Alpha Males who do not demonstrate the traits that make them Alpha.

The average hot girl is probably not thinking a fat mob boss is hot until he displays some sort of power yet he would be all of those traits. He leads other men. He has the respect of his crew and your fear because you know he could have you killed and disappeared in an instant. He does what he wants. But despite all that, the average women may not be attracted to him until that women learns of his power and position in the male social dominance hierarchy.

A common misconception about the social dominance hierarchy is just that -- that there is only one. Men's hierarchies are entirely different than women's, and what we consider alpha usually isn‚Äôt in the women's dominance hierarchy. An alpha women is the one able to identify the most alpha man, and submit to him. The most alpha man does not submit, he leads. Etc.

Now, the good news is, all of these traits can be cultivated. You now know a thing or two, but can you do a thing or two with that knowing?

"What, some of you clowns are actually MAD about OnlyFans?","[Are you seriously that retarded?](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/kdswj2/do_not_shame_onlyfans_creators/)

When are going to stop being butthurt about every girl on the planet not being your ideal Stepford sex slave, and start thinking about them as a commodity that that follows the rules of economics? 

A small but significant percentage of the latest generation of basic self-absorbed bimbos *just dropped the bottom out of the pussy market.* 

Three times. 

First because the price of a girl getting naked for ya is now fixed at about the going rate of a cup of fancy coffee. 

Second because so many of the simps who used to give out free attention are now at home jerking off to cheap custom porn, which drives the price of male attention up. 

Third because now ordinary girls, instead of just drug addicts whose daddies beat them, are now joining the sex work economy. Which normalizes prostitution. And when that becomes legalized in the same that weed did, the real price of pussy will forever be public knowledge, and it won't be much. 

Look, if TRP was the Tradcon Central Committee of the Revive EthnoNationalist Socialism Movement, and you were a good little Christian Patriarch in Training, looking for your pure-as-the-driven-snow Aryan forever wife, to have starfish sex with you once a month with the lights off and raise your 3.5 children in exchange for half your shit, then, yeah, OnlyFans would lower your pool of options. 

But you're not. You're a degenerate pervert who's here to learn to keep your pimp hand strong and be a better degenerate pervert, from older, wiser, and more degenerate perverts like me. And you don't care if society fucks off down a hole and drowns itself, because it wasn't your decision to send it there, and you have neither the power nor the obligation to save it. 

Don't you get it yet? You may be living in Upside Down Clown World, and the people running the circus may hate you, but you're still at an advantage because *you're the only guy in the room who isn't dressed like a clown*. 

Did you not ever wonder why the old world failed? Why the tradcons got their asses kicked by feminism? Because Top Side Up Pussy Cartel World sucked, too, just in a completely different way. Think about how fucking *thirsty* the baby boomer men must have been, to kick over their entire society just for the promise of little unshaven free-love poontang? (Which they largely never got.) 

I don't have to think about it. I was *there*. I *saw*. 

Yes, it's true that girlfriend material is scarcer. Yes, it's true that in my high school, you couldn't have thrown a sock in a classroom without hitting three thin, pretty, white or asian girls who were relatively polite and didn't even use cuss words. 

But getting them in bed was a lot of work. Nowdays you can have all the variety you want, quick and easy and cheap, and if you want a girlfriend, it doesn't actually matter as much as you think that supplies are dwindling... because your competition is dwindling even faster. 

I honestly don't know what I'm going to tell the girls at RPW. Because if they are still looking for a relationship and not already in one, *they are so completely and totally fucked*. Imagine trying to keep your N-count low when every swingin' dick out there expects a test drive before he even thinks about buying, to say nothing of the joy riders who are only pretending to be in the market at all. 

But you... you are going to be fine. Feminism has given you far more power over women than patriarchy ever would have. So stop slut-shaming. Sluts are good for you. They suck your dick, and make it harder for other women to say no. Just ignore or laugh at them if they want your commitment and love. 

Go get 'em, boys.",160,1
Do NOT shame onlyfans creators,"2020 saw the meteoric rise of onlyfans and the further normalization of thot culture. Since only fans is also owned by a man, that means this pimp just created the largest prostitution ring ever in recorded human history! 

For many of you, these thots are going to try to be your gf/wife one day. Thaaats right! Your gf/wife might have very well been half of the world‚Äôs whore for an evening. 

For those of you who care or have dignity when it comes to your choice of long-term mate, I imagine you‚Äôre fervently writing on your dating profiles, or bringing it up early in conversation about how much disdain you have for onlyfans and girls who generally partake in E-thot culture. 

This is a poor move; you can do better. Far better. 

The youngest women are going to do this regardless of how you feel. They are young, dumb, want money, and have an army of simps ready to lay down their purse of coins at her feet for a FLASH of a *CRUMB* of pussy - and for many, 2020 felt like the end, ‚Äúso why the fuck not?‚Äù They figured. ‚ÄúMen certainly don‚Äôt care about a woman‚Äôs sexual past.‚Äù

So what are you, red pill man, to do? 

Do not give credence to the idea that you dislike onlyfans. This will only activate her self-preservation instincts to hide the slutty truth. A better strategy, would be to talk about how sex-positive you are and how much it doesn‚Äôt bother you that girls are making onlyfans.

Only then might she reveal the truth depth of her depravity. Only then can you make your decision about what to do about her once this truth is brought to light...",235,1

I feel perpetually blackmarked and branded as a low status pariah.,"I am relatively new to the redpill community, and one of the younger users. I do not share political beliefs or similar backgrounds to most avid followers so learning about this stuff has been very interesting but often difficult to apply to my own life situation. You all have been very helpful for me and I thank you. This is my first post here so I will start from the beginning.

My entire life I have been an outcast in my own home. No friends, bullied as a child, treated like human trash basically. Roughly a year ago, I finally asked out a girl who I felt a strong sexual attraction for. While several months before this she had expressed interest in me, at the point where I finally admitted how I felt that spark had long expired. She rejected me, and went off and dated someone better looking than myself. 

After this happened I became very cynical and jaded, but after a few months that rejection and brooding over my already-weak ego was almost out of my thoughts. That was, until my 18th birthday came around. At which point all my past failures, of how girls hated my guts in middle and high school, of how I went 18 years without making any true friends, and how I got rejected all those months ago, came bubbling up again. A man and nothing to show for it. Now it's been 2 months since then and I still think daily about a shit childhood and a terrible failure with women. 

Obviously this isn't a rational thing to think about. I don't really develop emotional bonds to others, including friendships, which makes experiencing things like this very unique for me as I have serious ego problems (as in feelings of worthlessness and self loathing) after one bad incident, but no real ""woe is me I caught feelings"" thoughts in my head. 

Now, everywhere I go, I feel like a pariah. I feel branded as a failure and a former social outcast . Girls don't seem to show any interest in me whatsoever even when I try my hardest to do everything right. I work out. I am very tall but scrawny. I am average looking. I am working to fix all my physical defects, and am lucky enough that they are all correctable within the next few years with my hard work.

I am curious if anyone could offer some advice and guidance on how to deal with these extremely strong feelings of self-hatred and dealing with having been a failure and pariah as a child. Thank you kindly in advance.",177,1

"Don't know where else to post, just have a lot on my chest.","There's like, no where else to post this sort of stuff at all. Even this sub is quarantined. I guess I want to tell my story and share my thoughts, but sometimes it feels like I'm not allowed to even have these thoughts.

So, I had a girlfriend for two years. It was a pretty shitty relationship, and we really only got together because it was mutually beneficial, although I would argue she used me and lied to me and that her doing that wasn't justified simply because it got me out of the home of this crazy Christian asshole who owned the house of the bedroom I rented. Right off the bat, she'd flirt with exes, she'd download dating apps behind me, cheat on me, and actually right after we signed the lease, literally within the first week, she told me she didn't really want to be with me and just wanted to get out of her neglectful, abusive father's house. My trust was immediately broken in her, and caused years-long arguments after that and really just tore me down as a person. Personality-wise, mentally, I just don't even think I'm the same person anymore. How much I got used, shamed...

She would cheat on me with managers from work, people from Tinder, and elsewhere. She was last sleeping for months with the store manager of my last job, so when she finally just left the apartment one night when I went out for a walk, that was just it. Haven't seen or spoken to her since, not even once, not at all. Well, when she left, the store manager *immediately* dropped his act and began to only very slightly subtly threatening me with write-ups and such, so I right away called HR on the asshole and then quit the job. I hope I at least scared them both enough to stop fucking, that's at least a little bit of revenge, but who knows? I sure don't.

She taught me something, and that's that women are like men. I mean, when I think about it, I want a woman with some bigger-than-average tits at the least, a bit taller than me, a little thick, who can really just dominate me physically. I don't know, it's just fun, don't judge? And women like guys who are really tall and have big dicks. And just saying that, admitting that, is, like, frowned up? Is seen as shallow, incell-y, rude? Well, I'm a really God damn short guy, one of the reasons my ex said she left is I'm not actually very big and she always cheated with guys who were *way* bigger... No, man. I think people, when it comes to sex, are pretty primitive and predictable, and the honest truth is I just don't fit the bill for almost all women. I have a BA degree, I'm decently smart I would like to think, I have a good sense of humor I believe, yadda yadda, but literally none of it matters. I'm not six feet tall, I'm not seven or eight inches long. So it just doesn't matter.

I don't know, that bitch really fucking destroyed me inside and I can't describe it enough. Sometimes, I think I have PTSD-like moments, and I just have these flashes of memories and talk as if she's there. And any time I try to open up about this to anyone, either they don't understand, or think I'm simply a misogynist somehow.

I just can't tell you how alone I feel, how destroyed I feel.",73,1
Social media game and 2 ways to win it,"""Social media has two effects:¬†For women is gives endless options and for men it gives the ILLUSION of endless options.""
- forgot who said this, my money is on uncle Vas

Social media is the ultimate depression inducer, life waster and slave maker. But it's also a useful way to rise social status, especially amongst younger folks and it will be even more powerful in the future. 
And it's the new (ASD friendly) dating app where relatively high quality women hang out.

#1
Now, you can ""win"" social media game by not playing it at all, and let me tell you, this method fucking works! and you'll never worry about it consuming your life as we'll see in the second method.
""why aren't you on Instagram?"" they ask. ""I don't like it."" you answer.
And before you think I'm some Anti-socialMedia Boomer, I'm in my early twenties.

#2
But you can also win this game by actually winning it, and simultaneously staying out of the grid.
And that's by having simple yet interesting photos and a respectable amount of followers. BUT most importantly, not using the account at all.
This way, 18 yo chicks (and trust me they are all retarded) won't see you as a weirdo, and your time and attention won't be wasted on useless shit.",2,1

"Be resented, hated or used. Pick one.","During the quarantine, I've succumbed to using online dating apps. This experience pulled me into a black-hole of hatred and depravity; mostly from the side of the woman. 

What started as an innocent attempt to communicate with the opposite sex, turned into the realization that women on dating apps are not interested in dating. They are interested in harvesting simps for their paid platforms. OnlyFans, MyFreeCams, Chaturbate and so on. 

My curiosity peaked and I began to wonder how the psychology of these unapologetic thots worked. So I go to google and look to see if there are cam girl/thot forums; perhaps if I read some of their communications, I'd gain deeper insight into what makes them tick. What kinds of guys these women are ACTUALLY attracted to.  Being Red Pilled since 2012, I was not expecting to be surprised by the content. However, I was surprised just how disgusted I was at the things they openly wrote and discussed. 

The Red Pill subreddit is under quarantine. Supposedly, we publish ""hate speech"" against women. My friends, we could not hold a candle to the things I saw on those forums. I'm not naming these forums by name, because I don't want to bring attention back to ourselves. If you wish to see it for yourselves, just follow the bread crumbs. There are dozens of subreddits right here on reddit that help women manipulate and con men out of money. Instructions on how to make a man ""fall in love with you"" for the sole purpose of milking him for all his worth. 

In my curiosity, I ventured to make a fake account and post something to one of these forums as a fellow thot. I posted a question about how to find ""quality men in a sea of simps"". The responses made me absolutely disgusted. Not one response talked about what a high-value man meant to them or whom they would deem ""datable"". It was nothing but self-congratulatory quips about how men's only purpose is to be milked for their money. 

Perhaps the responders were on the extreme side of things, but have no illusions my friends. Thousands of young, impressionable girls with a desire to make easy money will go down the rabbit hole of tricking themselves out online for a few extra bucks. From my PMs and public posts on those forums, it seemed like these women have three ways they relate to men. They resent them, they hate them or they simply use them. Subsequently, I cannot help but reciprocate these ways of relating to women myself. 

Here is the sad part, as much as I want to blame these women for this bullshit, it's actually men's fault. We enabled them. WE gave them the freedom to do this. Women simply fill in the roles we put out for them. It's not like a woman invented the idea of a strip-club. It's not like a woman wrote the first streaming software. And it's not like women force men to pay for their nudes; we do it voluntarily. This was our fault. In my view, it started with giving women the right to vote. Perhaps you'll think that's an extreme view... well I don't care. 

The sad reality is, women are slowly losing the ability to care for or respect men in general. We are a worthless piece of trash to them worth only as much as they can get out of us. So going into your next ""relationship"", consider this gentlemen; does she resent me, hate me or trying to use me?",79,1
Advice I would give any young man,"**They all want magic‚Äôs biggest secrets finally revealed.** As if the plethora of Internet content describing it in detail has become too slick- too Hollywood; just as detached from reality. Average men spend a lifetime studying bullshit to screw a fraction of what the dirtbag bartender is pulling strung out. The quickest way to cut the line is a bag of coke. I know this because Delicious Tacos knows this.

Stay single long enough with your eyes open, talk to enough women, and you‚Äôre going to come to the same conclusions. Once more men get it, society will fall. **The trick is to have your interests align with what women find attractive- interests so personally fulfilling that if you never get laid again they become spiritual quests.** Without sex, lifting weights takes on a more authentic gravitas. The creation of good art- good, as defined by your own standard, will mean more than any woman‚Äôs opinion of you. A deep connection to nature. Reflections on philosophy, history and morality. The ability to make yourself laugh. Good food. Presence. This is the advice I would give- or just get a bag of coke.

[EXCERPT FROM: **[YOU'RE JUST LIKE DELICIOUS TACOS](https://killtoparty.com/2020/12/13/youre-just-like-delicious-tacos/)**] 

**Lesson:** The only way to be successful is to first, genuinely and authentically, *live for yourself.* This is the biggest different between The Red Pill and Pick Up Artists- they're always faking it, **we fake it *until we make it*-** and that second part is crucial. Making it is the only way it's gonna work out in the long-term; you must become the warrior, not just play warrior on weekends.

Is it really THAT bad that I want a woman to take care of me?,"I put this in culture because there was no discussion flair so apologize in advance.

I've been a long-time lurker in this community because I value the ideas here and find it hard to find other men who relate in my own life.

I just graduated with my bachelor's degree a couple of weeks ago, and I'm having a little trouble finding a good job. I currently work part-time at a gym, but I know I need something full-time to be able to take care of myself of course.

It's just that I'm SO stressed out. I've known for a WHILE now that the regular 9 to 5 life is not for me. I'd rather be a husband, then eventually a father and be able to stay at home. However I'm single right now, and doing my best to employ red pill principles to attract my possible future woman.

Am I wrong for feeling this way? Everyone is always asking me if I am going to pursue my master's, but honestly I just don't want to. I'm perfectly okay with finding a nice little job that pays well enough, until I find my possible future woman. But you men know that you can't tell that to people, or else they'll eat you alive.

I guess I just need a little assurance, since the pressure of life is kind of getting to me. I honestly don't care about being a high-powered career man, but that's what everyone kind of expects from men today. I'm definitely not opposed to working, I'll always work. But I just want a woman to be a provider and have my back while I do what I do. I want that support system.",13,1
I Had Lunch with the Chad I Hated Today,"I Had Lunch with the Chad I Hated Today

Intro:

Picture the worst loser you ever met.

Acne, glasses, hair that looks like his Mom cut it, dyel body...

Now multiply that by 2X and that's me in College.

Now picture my counterpart, let's call him Chang for shits and giggles.

6'2"", chiseled jaw, cool haircut, abs, social butterfly

Only thing we had in common is that we were both Asian...

He was good with girls and I hated him for it. Hated him more than anyone else. It was one thing when a white guy or black guy was good with girls, but to see an Asian guy do it, it just brought out that crab bucket beta out of me like nothing else.

I did not want to see this guy succeed. His every success reminded me of my own failure. Kind of like Samuel L Jackson‚Äôs character in Django Unchained rofl.

I remember getting super drunk at a party one time. It was my final desperate attempt to take the spotlight away from him.

I approached every girl there like a retard, hammered out of my mind, thinking that I was being the man for being so KAWNFIDUNT but actually creeping people out, now that I look back at it.

Chang used a wire coat hanger to restrain me as he wrestled my drunk foolish ass out of the building.

Body:

So what did I do?

I worked my butt off for 12 hours a day every day for the rest of my college years until I surpassed him!!!

Just kidding!!! Lol

Instead, I took the easy way out and immersed myself in video games for the next 3 years of college.

Meanwhile, Chang was getting pussy left and right, hot girls girls of every race. How do I know? Because his dorm was right across from mine.

I remember sitting there in my dorm playing DOTA like the antisocial phaggot I was. Meanwhile every time I passed by Chang‚Äôs dorm room, I saw hot girls playing with his hair (as in actually digging their fingers into his hair and combing it), having flirty conversations...

‚ÄúMan fuck this guy,‚Äù I thought to myself. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not even proud of his race. He‚Äôs just a whitewashed piece of shit!‚Äù

Now let‚Äôs fast forward 10 years after graduation.

I had been working on myself like a mofo

Took a lot longer than others but I finally got shredded at the gym, courtesy of heavy compound lifts (and Testing my Limits Anavar giving up)

Read everything I could get my hands on regarding social dynamics, including everything on RedPill, just about every self help book you can imagine from Think and Grow Rich to How to Win Friends and Influence People.

Even hired several coaches in the opening stages since nothing I was doing in the field was working and I needed guidance to overcome my own blindspots

Finally things started coming together and I got competent at cold approach. Competent enough to spin several plates at the same time.

Competent enough to not have everything be a giant numbers game anymore because I finally figured out how to bring the ‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù girls from ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù to ‚Äúfuck yes‚Äùinstead of only banging girls who were highly receptive from the beginning.

At this point, I decided to call it mission accomplished with girls and start my own business. Ironically enough this just made it even easier to get girls. Funny how working on yourself plays out like that.

Recently I saw that Chang got engaged so I commented ‚Äúgrats man‚Äù on his post, while snickering inside thinking I‚Äôd finally surpassed him

And you know what happened? ‚ÄúLong time no see Karl, we should grab lunch some time to catch up!‚Äù

Fast forward to yesterday and I‚Äôm sitting across from Chang, the guy that was always in the back of my mind as this great Nemesis.

And to my surprise, he turned out to be a pretty cool guy.

He‚Äôs actually the first Asian guy I talked to that didn‚Äôt have a crab bucket mentality and try to drag me down when we got past the small talk and started talking about how we really saw the world.

We could finally relate to each other. Talked about how you gotta tease girls when they act bitchy and their icy exterior will melt right off, how you gotta sexualize subtlety from the very beginning, etc

Topics that if I even began to approach with my old friends would get weird looks...

He was making a killing in CyberSecurity.

And settled down with a beautiful Asian girl.

I asked him why when he was banging so many hot girls of all races in college and he said that as far as he‚Äôs aware, every Asian guy who grew up in the west has this fantasy of banging hot whites girls to prove his masculinity

It‚Äôs just something every minority goes through, to prove himself ‚Äúworthy‚Äù.

Some guys give up and just play video games instead

Some put in the work and succeed.

But Chang said that at the end of the day it‚Äôs about compatibility, finding someone that‚Äôs actually gonna support your bigger goals and not just be a waste of time.

He said that he used to be the same way, fucking hot girls for validation from society  or even to just prove himself worthy but now he honestly just wants to get married to someone who‚Äôs chill and supports his goals (as long as there‚Äôs an ironclad prenup lol)

I realized that Chang and I weren‚Äôt so different after all.

I asked him how he figured things out so quickly without having to read a million articles on RedPill and he said that he was lucky enough to have a really good high school football coach who taught him everything he knows about masculinity in a western culture.

Damn. I thought you were a Natural bro... is every natural just someone who grew up with positive male role models and learned game at an earlier age than everyone else?

And we both laughed about how Asian guys here just play video games all day and race whine on Reddit instead of actually working hard to improve their situation.

How they have the worst crab bucket mentality ever and all act like Samuel L Jackson in Django Unchained (I was one of them)

Long story short, we became friends and even started planning out businesses we could go into together once we accomplish our individual goals

Lessons Learned

Like a lot of other guys here, somewhere deep in the back of my mind, I had this revenge fantasy of showing former Chads in my life how much progress I made.

It‚Äôs the classic ‚Äúrevenge of the nerds‚Äù fantasy where the high school jock is now flipping burgers and you have hot girls in both arms.

But life doesn‚Äôt really work that way.

Chads tend to get into good fraternities in College and things just snowball from there.

In everything.

Girls, finance, social circle...

Their good looks open a lot of doors that were closed to you, as long as they‚Äôre willing to put in the work.

So yes, if that revenge fantasy is gonna help you grind out one more rep at the gym and scream ‚ÄúFUCK YOU CHAD!‚Äù At the end of the set, by all means use that anger for fuel.

Just don‚Äôt be surprised when you have to cut off all your old friends who keep dragging you down.

And find that you actually relate to Chad more now.

P.S. And no, I didn‚Äôt suck Chang‚Äôs dick, no homo lmao",131,1
The total Feminist plan Exposed,[removed],0,1
The myth of quality women,"At one point I became sick of clubbing and started looking for women elsewhere in places like yoga classes, hikes etc. I did this because I wanted something deeper than a ONS and felt that I wouldn't find a ""quality"" girl worth pursuing if I kept looking for girls in clubs. 

A few months back I was on a hike and met a gorgeous girl who was just my type, Latina, long hair, perfectly tanned skin, sexy ass etc. She was super into me aswell and we ended up in a relationship before she had to go back to Chile as she was here on an exchange.

I thought I had finally found a good girl etc. But after we became close with eachother she told me her last sexual encounter was a ONS with a guy from a club. So there you go, JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T MEET IN THE CLUB DOESN'T MEAN SHE DOESN'T GO CLUBBING

If she isn't a whore for you she's a whore for someone else. I could've saved myself from wasting time going on silly hikes and gone clubbing and met the same bitch. Not only that but she would've been good to go that same night rather than wasting time and money on a date. Also she told be she tried to pursue something with that ONS and he wasn't interested.

Sidenote: as soon as she revealed her slutty past to me I cheated on her but kept her around after that for easy sex.",82,1

How I pulled HB 8-10s when I was young and single.,"I do read TRP time to time but rarely comment but will do tonight. 

In my early 20s I was an average looking guy 5‚Äù7 and 155lb not bold or fat.

I would describe my look/SMV mid 7s definitely not a Chad or Tyrone. I was able pull HB 6-7s with my limited resources but really deep inside I wanted to pull girls way above my league such as HB 8-10s.¬†

It was much harder to pull those model looking girls since there are plenty of better looking guys hitting on them especially good looking trust fund kids with unlimited resources.  I realized after a ONS with a HB 8 that you can‚Äôt easily impress or KEEP these girls around if you are broke, drive a shitty car or live in with a roommate in a inexpensive neighborhood.¬†

So I come up with 4 point plan right away.¬†( This is happening in 2004-05 so no Tinder yet)

1- Focus on my career going forward so I can save and earn more money 

2- Rent a condo/flat in a city center so it looks like I can stand on my own and got my shit together¬†

3- Drive an expensive German sports car and dress from Italian brands¬†

4- Lift Min 3-4 days a week and eat healthy food¬†

It took me little over a year to achieve my 4 point plan but I did it. 

I bought nice Italian brand clothes

I rented 1200 sq. ft. 1 bed condo in a nice neighborhood

I bought a Porsche to drive daily¬†

I was in the gym 3-4 days a week¬†

I started hitting on HB 9-10s in the clubs, restaurants, bars but it wasn‚Äôt easy since you can‚Äôt approach these girls and open a set like hey check out my sports car or place .. I was in a Gucci but still 5‚Äù7 and 155lbs so definitely not a model type to mesmerize them.¬†

Then I realized I need to improve my social status/game so I don‚Äôt need to advertise what I have or what I could offer. I paired up with my best friend/wingman and started hitting all the clubs 3-4 nights a week and started to see results right away. We were out to socialize and have fun not chase girls but always looked for opportunities to approach HBs.¬†

I was able pull some really hot¬†8-10s but realized some of them are looking for a bf not a fuckboy some of the girls were shallow, psycho or junkie. Some wanted to move in with me right away some wanted to get exclusive right away some were disappointed because I was rich for my age but not rich enough  for them. 

I definitely had my fun and was spinning plenty of HB 8-9s a few 10s after achieving my 4 point plan. So after 3 years spinning plates I decided to slow down and settle like every other smart man. I picked a HB 7 who can cook, clean and suck a dick.¬†In the long run I really don't have time to cook, clean and make money to raise a family. 

I would recommend all the young guys to learn the Game in the field (not on YouTube or from a book)  You need to approach and socialize to improve your game then maybe apply my 4 point plan to back up your social status to attract HB 8-10s. Nothing is impossible as long as you have a plan and determination.",12,1

Conservative Men in the U.S. - Time to Start Planning an Exit Strategy?,"To preface this post, this is not me acting just like Liberals did in 2016 when Hilary lost. This is not me screaming that I'm going to leave this country to never actually do it. I'm actually being serious and it's something I have considered off and on for several years now.

Between the steal, Coronavirus, partisan politics unable to get anything done (I'm recently unemployed because of long term effects of Covid shutdowns) in terms of stimulus or any policies for the countries, I'm just done. What this election did show me is that we no longer are a free country. We no longer have free and fair elections and we absolutely no longer have any mainstream media source (not even Fox News) that is in even remotely Conservative. I believe the United States is now beyond saving. But more than anything, this is just not a nice country anymore. It's divisive, mean spirited and full of hatred, on both sides. And it's become a country where being a white male is a crime. I'm tired of it. I think it's time for a lot of us to realistically start looking at our exit strategies.

I don't plan on leaving the United States in the immediate future. While I am single with no children my parents are still alive and I just could not leave them, especially my mother. I am very close to my mother and the idea of leaving her would break my heart. But once my parents are gone (dad is 75, mom is 72) in 15 - 20 years I will have very little to keep me here. Yes I do have a brother, sister in law and 2 nieces but they aren't enough to keep me here.

Besides all of that, I've never truly felt like the United States was my home. The US is a country where Extroverts dominate in all aspects of life. I'm an Introvert and being an Introvert in this country isn't easy. I also dislike our society in how they worship youth and just want to throw away our older citizens, the ones who have wisdom and experience. The whole ""ok boomer"" thing to me is just sad. I think a lot is said about a country in how they treat the oldest and youngest members of society. Between our disrespect of elders and the rampant use of abortion we fail on both counts.

For me I am considering the following countries to relocate to after my parents are gone. The countries would be:

Czech Republic (Free Society, Conservative Oriented, White Culture, Partially English Speaking)

Poland (Free Society, Conservative Oriented, Catholic Oriented, White Culture)

Costa Rica (Beautiful Country, Large Expat Community)

Spain (Beautiful Country, Large Expat Community, Cheap Cost of Living)

Argentina (Beautiful Country, Cheap Cost of Living)

Japan (Asian Culture, Stable Economy, Introvert Friendly, Community Oriented, Modern)

South Korea (Asian Culture, Stable Economy, Great Entertainment, Community Oriented, Modern)

The easiest countries to move to would of course be ones where there is a large Expat Community. By joining an established Expat Community it wouldn't be necessary for me to master the language before moving to the country. I could gain basic conversations skills in the language, move to the expat community in the country and then start the process of mastering the native language.

The Eastern European countries wouldn't be as easy to move to but they are White dominated cultures where you aren't evil for being white. Being Catholic as well Poland definitely has a pull for me.

Argentina is majority Hispanic but has its roots in Europe. It also has a very laid back culture but the government there (really anywhere in South America) is very unstable. Spain is in a similar position, very laid back, low cost of living, stable government but not a lot of jobs.

The Asian countries would be the hardest to move to but I think would be the most rewarding. I honestly feel like I should've been born into an Asian culture. I just feel like I fit better in those cultures. Obviously cost of living in Japan and South Korea are very expensive and the language aspect would be difficult but it might be worth it in the long run.

But what about you? Are you tired of fighting what feels like a losing battle? Are you intrigued like I am to get away from the failed U.S. experiment? What countries are you considering? What advice would you give someone like me?",51,1

Society...,"Hello gentlemen

I lurk here from time to time and I have to say I am very impressed with the amount of in-depth knowledge some of you have put into your posts and comments. I wanted to share some of my experiences here, this is my first post so feel free to extrapolate if it suits your fancy. You noticed my title says ""Society"", we will get to that soon.

Let me tell you about my experience.

I have hung around beautiful women for as long as I can remember. It's gotten to the point where I became a natural flirt and I can't help myself, even briefly meeting any woman from the scale of 5-10 (I don't flirt with any woman below that. It's just how I am) will invoke some flirtatious gesture in any conversation about any topic. It's because of the decades I've spent almost every day playing around with them, getting to know them, joking around and learning their psychology. Now I'm 27 and I'm not getting any younger, the game is the same but the rules are changing. I've learned a thing or two being around so much pussy.

So if you have time, I would like to share my lessons.

One: If you want a lot pussy you have to have some form of assertiveness. There's not other way around it. Sometimes it's different for me but most men don't share my experience. Not many girls out there fall from the sky onto your lap and will dry hump your leg because you're that interesting shy type who looks mysterious like that protagonist in a $5 drama novel. It sounds good on paper but in my experience it rarely works. It rarely ever workes but that's only if you look like a model. Here's why I think this. I have an older brother who you would consider a ""bad boy"". I'm talking gangs, getting into fights, selling drugs, went to prison, the whole 9. I lived with his ex who is hot as hell and she obsesses over him even though he treats her like shit, it's because of his bad boy attitude. She goes nuts for him. You don't have to engage in everything he did, but he definitely has the attitude to make women pay attention to him. I myself approach differently as I never had any endeavors close to his. I lived a different life, different friends, different ways to make money, everything about us is different ; except the assertiveness. However, even though I had women throw themselves at me for years and years, sometimes they will say they love me out of the blue, I never got pussy until I hit my early 20's. Gentlemen, I was in fact, bluepilled.Thats right. Girls would lead me to janitor closets but I was too stupid to fuck them, they would shove their asses against my crotch and ask if I can be their boyfriend or whatever but I was too shy to go forward. Too introverted to communicate my desires when faced with such intensity. It wasn't until I went to the military and met a friend who showed me the ways of attraction, before I even discovered the redpill, that I became increasingly better at pulling women.. Which leads me to my second point.

Two: If you want to know how she thinks/feels about you, break the touch barrier as fast as possible. I never use Tinder or any online dating app. It's just not my style, I'm an up close and personal type of fellow. I have game, I know that, decades of practice only suitable for close encounters. And actions speak louder than works. When I mean touch, it varies depending on the situation you're in. I myself have been in SO MANY situations where the touch barrier was broken right away. I am fairly attractive. I admit I have been falling off but if I drink enough water and eat right, work out, things happen to me. Crazy things happen. If I'm in a bar and a woman is looking at me for about five seconds or longer, I can just tell she is thinking about me in some way. I would walk into a bar with my buddies, and a hot chick would single me out and make out with me first minute, don't even know her name. She just grabs my face and starts slobbering. She leaves because she's drunk and I stay because I just got there, like, let me drink with my bros, another hot chick comes along five minutes later and I talk and fuck her at her friends place for the night. I don't usually like to go out too much because I do care about my health and I notice that I do attract women, I sometimes don't know how (elder men tell me it's because they're horny), I don't even try to sometimes it just fucking happens but the touch barrier becomes broken right away letting me know how they think. You don't have to touch them in the thighs or be all weird about it. Make sure you touch them in some way that's appropriate to the situation. If not than it's all a mental game and women fuck themselves over after a while. Touching them either tells you they are either comfortable with you or not. It's very important. This ties in to my third point.

Three: Don't be desperate. Just don't. They can see thirst from a mile away. Also don't be too intimidated by a girl outside your league. I have a way to use being shy to my advantage. I like to tell them they're hot as fuck without actually saying it. But they're human, just like me, and I'm very seductive so I also use my body language to let them know I can get them off pretty hard l if they want. If not I just look for someone else. Plenty of girls looking to get off. But I don't always go looking. I often happen to find myself in the awareness of these girls as I go about my life minding my own business and they come to me and I surf the wave from there. Its because of how I look. It's also deeply ingrained in my brain to be flirtatious, I'm pretty good. I'm not the best. I like to have fun with it, it's like a game I play sometimes. I find women interesting. I don't really hold their lustful nature against them. However they can be toxic. But I know too much to hold it against them. I just find it cute when they get a little bitchy and I know how to handle and exchange vibes with a female that falls on any number on the attraction meter. 10s do throw me off my game a bit. Its because a lot of them (almost all of them) have high sociopathic tendencies, whether they know it or not. It's insane. I don't think I will ever date a 10. It's too dangerous. I'm just saying. To be honest I stay away from them. Somehow they manage to find me, but you will never catch me with one for long. Those women are a breed of their own. Crazy in the sheets and in the streets. They're just masters at hiding it. 

Four: Society has fucked you and me over. This is the red bow that ties this package together. The forth thing I've learned this far. I'm only 27, but throughout my life I have been conditioned. I was bluepilled. I believed in that lovey dovey rose colored love life I could have with ""The one"". I believed women can be pure souls who would care for me like my mother did when I was young. I saw the light. To me it's like Plato's Republic when Socrates talks about his Cave Allegory. If you haven't read it yet it's pretty good philosophy and it  explains things like this. Go read it. But we all know society has fucked up the minds of individuals constantly. We have to find ways to deflect the conditioning by working on ourselves, reading, doing whatever we can to self-relflect and figure out who we really are instead who they say we should be in order to fit in. Fuck fitting in. Get fit. Fuck bowing down to their expectations of marriage and bullshit because they somehow got it into our heads that being alone is sad, and means you're unwanted. Those are thoughts of an unhinged teenage girl. It's best to get married when both don't even have to think about benefiting by taking advantage of one another, just for the benefits society gives to married couples like tax returns and other health care benefits or whatever is out there for that kind of thing. I don't know I've never been married. Men can be alone and thrive. Women need someone, or else they collapse into oblivion. Life is not for the weak-minded. The best fruits of life given to the weak minded will kill them when challenges arise but for the sharpened mind it's laughed at. For the strong it's taken head on. And when you face these challenges and triumph, those who see you at the top, never observing your struggle, will wonder how you did it. They will gaze in amazement and wish they could achieve what you will achieve. Even the women most men chase and orbit today. They'll think about you. 

Bonus: If you find yourselves fucking around with a nympho, don't stick around for long. Those chicks are cray cray. 

Alright guys sorry for the lengthy post. I felt like I should contribute since I'm a 'freshman' here, I feel. I think I do have what it takes to be the best I can be with this and this is knowledge in the progress from my experience. Something that can be amended, worked on, etc. I still have a resurgence of bluepill tendencies here and there. So I have a lot to learn. 

Thanks for reading. Good luck out there guys, it's a jungle.",77,1

All tbis redpill shit is nonsense,"I‚Äôve been following this for going on 5 years and I‚Äôve just come to realize over the years, it‚Äôs a big fucking joke. I‚Äôve been friends with guys my whole life who have banged hundreds of women and own multiple businesses that would never preach any of the shit on here. The only truth to any of this is frame which just comes naturally if you‚Äôre not a completely insecure beta pussy.


You‚Äôre gonna fall in love with women. Some of them might smoke crack rocks in your bed til 8 am. It‚Äôll be a good time. At least you‚Äôre not like the fucking pussys on this board who can‚Äôt even get laid. 


Feminism is bad, anyone that‚Äôs not decently brainwashed knows and feels this in their bones. Not every woman is a die hard feminist. Yes all modern western women have been slightly affected by it but who cares, as long as they don‚Äôt talk about it and aren‚Äôt vocal about it/ realize they are part of it they are not a threat. If they are still a threat because ‚Äúwestern woman has been indoctrinated by feminism‚Äù than you are beta. Go back to jacking off to Jordan Peterson in your mother‚Äôs basement. 


Yes men‚Äôs rights in divorce court should be a thing and I truly feel bad for the people who get fucked over and can‚Äôt see their kids. But most of the guys on here are just bitter incels who can‚Äôt get laid.

How soon is too soon to buy gift for rotation piece?,"So I‚Äôve been fucking this girl in my rotation once a week for about 3 months now. I feel like it‚Äôs worth noting that I fuck her raw. I‚Äôm 26, she is 24. She‚Äôs a solid 7.5, but 8.25 when she gets all done up.

I don‚Äôt over pursue or talk to her all the time. Maybe twice a week tops through text. I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs high interest. She sends me good morning texts every now and then, always stands close to me when we are out, tries to hold my hand, grabs my dick randomly, tells me how fine I am, etc. She really doesn‚Äôt cause me any issues to be honest and I like hanging out with her. 

She offers to pay for dates quite regularly and also smokes me out whenever we chill. She‚Äôs also very submissive in the bedroom. Whenever we stay the night with each other, she wakes me up with head and I always smash. She be wanting it even more than me, type shit.

So here‚Äôs where I may be about to mess up:

I got her a $138 bottle of Marc Jacobs perfume for Christmas, but I haven‚Äôt given it to her yet. I‚Äôm having second thoughts about giving it to her because I don‚Äôt wanna fuck up whatever we have going on. I‚Äôm not saying that from a scarcity point of view, I just don‚Äôt see the point of making a mistake I could‚Äôve avoided. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here for advice.

She told me when we first linked up that she doesn‚Äôt want to get attached and she doesn‚Äôt want a boyfriend right now. However, I can tell she‚Äôs starting to get in her feelings at least a little bit. Mind you, I got bitches on deck. I‚Äôm not pressed for pussy whatsoever and this is NOT an attempt to try to make her for like me more or no shit like that. I don‚Äôt even want to be in a committed relationship at the moment. I just like her, she‚Äôs cool, and I wanna give her a nice gift. 

Am I doing too much here? Should I just return the gift? Am I about to fuck this situation up?

Lemme know bros, I‚Äôm all ears!",104,1

Changing Behaviors,"**Tl;Dr:**

* Identify the behavior
* Consciously notice the behavior
* Think how to correct said behavior
* Notice behavior as it happens
* Notice behavior before it happens
* Notice then insert correction
* Time + correction = subconscious behavioral change

**Body:**

To change a poor behavior you first need to identify it's actions. When the behavior is physical in nature it's pretty straight forward. Mental behavior takes a little more thought. With a mental trait, you'll need to identify times, statements and physical actions that make up the poor behavior you're trying to eradicate.

The second step is to identify when you're performing the poor behavior. Again for a behavior that is solely physical, you might already be catching it in the action or right after it's finished. For a mental behavior, you might not realize you've slipped up until hours after it happened.

Once you start catching your slip ups, you need to figure out how to correct them. My recommendation is replacing the habbit with another one. That's really the only choice for a mental behavior. For instance you might stop bitting your nails by tapping them instead. Though that could also be seen as bothersome. One way to erase a habbit would be instead when you go to perform it, take a few deep breaths. 

An example of a personal mental hang up I have is over answering questions. Instead of answering a question right away, I repeat it to myself, attempting to answer directly what was asked, without explaining away my reasoning. What I did to get to that point was after realizing I'd over answered, I'd go back and mentally answer their specific question.


As you keep catching your slip ups, think how you could have improved in that instance because as you continually catch your slip ups you're going to move from realizing that they happened, to that you're in the middle of slipping up. Thankfully with my mental hang up, I can just shut up as soon as I realize I've over answered the question.

Maybe you won't be able to apply the correction as you're fucking up but eventually you'll start seeing yourself about to perform the poor behavior. Because we've been practicing what to do, it'll feel natural to slip the correction in.

From there, you stop catching the poor behavior because the corrected behavior has taken its' place. Sooner or later becoming just as much of a subconscious behavior as the bad one originally was.

**In Conclusion:**

Bitting nails is bad. Notice when you've chewed them off. Keep noticing again and again. Eventually noticing while you're in the process of clipping them off with your chompers. Stop biting, start taking deep, gut filling breaths. Over time you'll start doing this before biting the nails. You'll loose the urge to bite your nails. You may now just have moments of meditation throughout your life or perhaps you don't need to do the breathing exercise because you no longer notice yourself biting your nails. The habbit is gone either way.",4,1
How to monetize the red pill?,[removed],0,1
Stand Tall Making Eye Contact,"**Tl;Dr:**

Chest out, shoulders back. Head up, making eye contact with anything ahead.


**Body:**

You ever come home to a garbage can tipped over, the bag tore open and trash covering the floor. Then there's the dog. Sitting in the corner. Pouting, looking at the ground, not just avoiding eye contact but avoiding your image all together. Are you a bad dog? Did you do something wrong? Then why are you always looking at the ground and why can you never maintain eye contact?


*Do you check out women?*

Yes I'm checking women out. Checking out the men to but not so sexually. If you see a pretty little thing dressed like a tramp you're going to take a look. When she catches you looking at her body, do not look away in shame *like you just got caught* doing something disrespectful. Embrace her eye contact, let her know you see her. 


When anyone enters your view of sight it's instinctive to observe the new creatue.  ~~Lesser~~ Animals do it. It's an evolutionarily survival trait to be observant of your surroundings. Don't feel shameful when checking out women. It's in human DNA. What culture has hyperinflated into an exaggerated attempt to shame men for what comes natural, are a few instances of overly creepy men staring, following *them* around the venue, either physically or with his eyes. Even still if you read romance novels, which I recommend you not, *I could feel his eyes following me the entire night of the event, it made me burn hot knowing he was watching my every move.* Goes to show you; they want it, just not from losers. 


Check her out. If she catches you, own up to it. Acknowledge what you are doing. If you're really that interest, nows the time to approach. Otherwise leave her be but don't run from her eye contact. Worst she's going to do is give you a look of disgust, tap her friend on the shoulder and point. I've even had *ghetto bitche* yell *What the fuck you starrin at, whitey?* We all laughed about it.


Eye contact is a lot more important than women. Like I said I'm checking out the men in my surroundings too. I'm taking a good look, drinking in their persona with my eyes. If they catch me, there's been less than a dozen instances in fifteen plus years were it didn't end with a smile. That's it. The vast majority of the time, *a head nod and a smile* is it. Sometimes there is a verbal hello, old timers love to stop you for a chat. If you become a regular at the same locations, a little eye conact and a smile can open the door for conversation. 


Eye contact goes further with repeat encounters than strangers but that's a good place to start. Eye contact is huge part of good communication. It helps form trust, looking into someone's eyes while talking. Feeling intimated by it at first? Stare at their nose or eyebrows to help. Leaning into the discomfort will build a tolerance, eventually making the behavior normal. Trust me it's a lot harder to make too much eye contact than not enough.


Now there are a good number of people who avoid my eye contact. There's others reasons than this but the vast majority of men I see in public look defeated. Shoulders slouched. Head hanging low. If they're not avoiding my eye contact, they never had a chance to make it. They're staring at the ground in front of their feet for their entire life. *Walking around oblivious to their surrounding.*


Imagine that's your first impression, the look of defeat. It's a heck of a lot easier to maintain eye contact when your heads already lifted. Stand up straight, looking ahead. Bring your chest up, shoulders over your hips, over your ankles when you walk. That's where you start. Past that is an individual personalized remedy to actually straight your spine and fix your pelvic tilt. I'm not a doctor but we can all start here. *Posture check* yourself throughout the day.


Either when you're sitting or standing, check yourself through out the day to see if you're slouching or hunced over. Straighten up, bringing your chest up and shoulders back. Sitting or standing tall, erecting the spine. Hold it for as long as you can. I'm not kidding when I say some of you will have a sore core, shoulders, lower or upper backs. You might have to actively engage your core. After time and time again of *posture checking* yourself you'll see you're standing/sitting straight more and more often.


Good posture makes a world of difference with how you're received by the everyone. That's why it's Jordan Peterson first rule in his book: *Twelve Rules for Life; 
Stand up straight with your shoulders back.* That's not an edorsment to go read his book, tho I'm sure it's great, I've never read it. You don't need to be a pyscholgist or a professor of psychology to realize this. Be observant. 


Having doubts? Go to any large venue and scope out the public. See how poor the populations posture is. See how grossly out of shape most people are. Watch them avoid eye contact and each other, some literally scared of interactions with strangers. Decide, do you really want to walk around looking like that? You'll notice a few men though, walking around tall, proud, sure of themselves. Gazing around, happly waiting to greet you. Much like my dog, owning his behaviors, confidently exclaiming, *yes I not knocked down that garbage can, wanna see me do it again.* You do the same.

**In Conclusion:*

Eye contact is king, it's easier to maintain if you're already standing up straight. Standing up straight, having good posture makes you appear more confident to the world. Start *posture checking* yourself regularly to get in the habbit of maintaining good posture whether sitting or standing. If you're nervous about eye contract, look at their nose or eyebrows. They won't be able tell. If you get caught checking out a woman (or anybody for that matter) give them a nod, do something to own up to your actions. Don't dart your eyes away like scared puppy.",55,1

How old Blue Pill me would have fucked up here,"First of all, I hope the ""Field Report"" tag is appropriate here.

The experience I'm about to share has been a very good lesson to me, and an eye opener as to how useful TRP has been to me. I will try to keep details vague as the situation involves a woman who has quite a big following on social media.

About me: I'm 26 years old, currently in the last months of my getting my PhD, graduated as an engineer before that. I got my weight under control these past years after being obese for years, and I've started seeing A LOT of interest from women who wouldn't have looked at me a few years ago. After being approached by more women, I read a lot of blog articles on Rollo Tomassi's website, and started getting a better understanding of hypergamy and male vs female sexual strategies.

So, I joined this girl's community about a year ago, she's a streamer and a youtuber with a big following. She was a couple years older than me, and she was in a relationship, and lived with a guy she met in her own community. From what I can gather, she made the first move, and probably coerced him into a relationship using her following (which was lower but rising quite quickly at this point). The twist is: she was practically begging him to get married, but that guy kept saying no. She also talked about having kids, but he wouldn't hear it. She put on this facade of being hopelessly in love with him, called him the love of her life, called his parents her in-laws, and used the pressure of her community to force him into talking about children, and get a commitment from him.

I didn't think anything of it, and I initially wasn't interested by that girl. She was good looking, but not my type, and her being older than me did not help either. But I started feeling like she was showing quite a bit of interest, but in a very sneaky way. She started using the same language I was using, she started basically echoing everything I was doing, and I felt like she was constantly trying to impress me. I also played games with her a few times, and that's where she asked about my life situation, and was quite interested when I told her about what I was studying and what my life goals were. We also did have a lot of things in common, and naturally clicked, so it was always nice to interact with her.

It then started escalating, where any word I would utter in her community would heavily influence her behaviour, whether it be in the content she produced on youtube, or on other social media, as well as on streams. She acted like a little girl around me, tried to look attractive, tried any way she could to get my attention, as long as it wasn't too publicly obvious. She also kept sneaking references to stuff I had posted on my own social media, and it even got to the point where she sneakily said my name in some of her videos, and dropping some ""I love you"" as well. Sneaky enough that you would only catch it if you were really aware. Same for other signs where body language reading was really helpful to get an understanding of the situation. To test her, I took some distance, and that's when she started posting more and more flirty pictures online and sending stronger messages. There were also song covers involved and a LOT of other signs, she really couldn't have made it more obvious if she wanted (at least to me).

We were both living in a different country, but had planned to go back to the same country when my degree would be done, and when her work visa would be over in the country she was in (which coincidentally were going to happen around the same time).

She knew she wouldn't get a marriage out of her bf, and that she wouldn't get kids, and it didn't take a genius to realize what she was planning. At the same time, she could not be too obvious, because of the whole community watching, her still being in a relationship. Her bf handled a lot of the social media work too, and being in another country, she was quite dependent on him. (Basically tried to trap him in a situation where she would depend on him so much he would have to stay. Damn the more I analyze that, the more I wonder how I did not notice the 50 red flags beforehand)

But I realized she was simply trying to ""keep me on the hook"" for another year, until we were both done with what we were doing. So I confronted her, and told her I would not be a plan B, or wait for anything, and that if she was really serious, she would need to dump her boyfriend because I was not going to wait. =&gt; Now I'm not entirely sure about that direct confrontation (ultimatum, how desire cannot be negotiated, etc...). But in my situation, one thing was clear: I was not going to wait and be husband material later down the road if she was not ready to leave her relationship right now. She had also shown signs of resentment about her bf, albeit quite restrained still.

She sent quite a strong sign that she was ready to leave the relationship (and she was making tons of changes in her personal life). But I pressed her again. Something inside me was telling me: ""You're getting played. These are always words, never actions. She's just playing the clock"". And when I put more pressure on her, she completely dodged the confrontation and commented on something irrelevant in the messages I had sent her. That's when I simply blocked her and moved on.

It came to the point where, after months of manipulation and desperately trying to both keep a hopeless relationship going and to secure a high potential future husband, she had now realized I was not going to leave her any margin, and she was trying to manipulate me further, and gaslight me if necessary (hence the covert signs, and no overt confirmation at any time). She then came out publicly and flipped the situation to make it look like she got betrayed by someone she knew, and how I had been running after her, completely destroying my reputation in her community (which I was not a part of anymore, so I couldn't give two shits about it). And that was a huge contrast from her trying to make me look so good right before that, building my ego, making me feel important. That was as long as I was serving her imperative, as long as I shut my mouth, and just played the part. I just moved from the situation, knowing fully well that even if she could fool a whole community, her and I knew exactly what happened.

Now, no relationship actually occured, but I still felt like sharing because it did teach me a lot. I know that past me would have strolled along like a complete idiot. Getting that kind of attention from a woman with this kind of following felt like the perfect trap. But putting things back into context and into reality: I knew I was of way higher value than her. Woman in her late 20s, looking for someone to settle down with, with an illusion of fame and importance that will subside once she gets older. She is self conscious of that situation, and so am I, but most people in these communities only see the ""untouchable internet persona"", and they are obviously massive blue pills. And I would have been one of these people a few years ago.

So huge lessons for me: know your worth. Don't settle early, especially before reaching your potential. Strip down any illusion of social status and go for the raw facts and biology. Also: do not give a fuck about what other people think of you. I know I would have been terrified to block her, knowing that she would obviously destroy my reputation, thinking about what people would say about me, what my image would be. No fucks given. No attachment. Not being defined by anyone's perception. Pure, raw facts of knowing my potential and not needing an external source or some ego stroking to make me feel better.

A few years ago, I would have caught feelings, I would have tagged along, and maybe would've got burnt in the end because she stayed in a position where she could keep both doors open. I now sit back and watch her self esteem drop as the years go by, knowing her relationship will come to an end, and down the line, when she tries chasing a suitable guy when she is in her 30s and she has lost most of her appeal, she will think ""maybe I fucked up"". I'm also completely satisfied about this development because that means I have no strings attached, and sky is the limit as far as my career goes. Also feels like I dodged a potential manipulator and a gaslighter, which feels REALLY good.",12,1

Ego boosters?,"I am talking to bit of hot girls right 7-8s maybe a 9. They 100% have orbiters around them. The question is if these women see them (including me) as options (potential partner/hookup) or merely ego boosts. The answer could be either but most of the time it‚Äôs going to be ego boosters. 

If they hit you up on the regular and show genuine interest (yeah who knows, they may be lying) you are seen as an option. If they hit you up rarely, you‚Äôre an ego booster. This could be vise versa but that‚Äôs how it usually is. 

If you are high value male and messaging/communication works around your schedule then you are seen as an option or even THE option. Still though, if you are a high value male you can still be used as a ego boost, it comes down to whether she actually likes you or not. If she would fuck, then she likes you. Otherwise you‚Äôre an ego boost that is in a pile of simps orbiting her and I advice you to leave. 
The other situation is being in a smaller category of options that she is willing to fuck/get with. That‚Äôs just how social media has it. They (even 6-7 type girls) have a lot of guys to choose from. You aren‚Äôt only messaging one girl and she isn‚Äôt only messaging one guy. 
The point is to decide whether you are an option (in her rotation) or an ego booster and act accordingly. 

TL;DR Woman on social media have so many options (paradox of choice). You are either an option or a ego booster. You find out which one you are by seeing whether she is DTF or not.",27,1
Dont fall for the dick size illusion,"Women dont care about how big your dick is . No i mean , they really really dont care. As a man who is relatively well endowed , ive had women mention it or compliment it when they see it but that is as far as it goes.It doesnt make game easier , it doesnt make shit tests easier , it doesnt make women choose u over someone else because of dick size.  women will not see u as more attractive for your dick size compared to another man . will they like it if its literally tiny ? no ofcourse not , but in the grand scheme of things its nearly irrelevant . Ive seen guys on here talking like cucks about ""BBC"" this and that , if you think women like black guys because of dick size you are greatly mistaken. 

hell , even the sex doesnt matter that much. if a man can get a woman invested emotionally , never validate her , handle his shit calmly and logically , have his own life and social status , but last about 2 seconds in bed ? she will be hooked on you rather then the beta who validates her , puts her on a pedestal , and doesnt challenge her emotions even if the other guy can fuck her for 20 hours and make her cum 10 times.( the fallacy here is the beta wont get to fuck anyway but still) YES im serious. women dont care .  

HOWEVER they love to use the concept as a shit test and to throw men off centre. NEVER take what a woman says seriously , she will use dick size and BBC and whatever to try and throw u off centre and to test and prod to see how strong or weak u are , and to see if you get emotional. but trust me she doesnt give a fuck. its like the age old clasic , u ever see a womans dating profile and read what she writes ? "" i want a guy whos funny and caring and kind "" bla bla bla its all horse shit , nothing makes a woman drier then the nice guy. take this same concept and use it on everything a woman says . its all BS . 

There are things that women prefer physically on a man then other things , sure. for example height , muscle mass. But dick size is not one of those things.",82,1

Don't take poor interaction personally, *they're always having a terrible day.*

**Body:**

My boy put me onto tinder and remaking our accounts when  frequenting the same metropolitan. Fast forward and it's our third time in LA. Hitting the same neigborhood meaning the same woman swiping right.

The third time I've matched with this bitch. I remember because she's *my type of sexy.* Same photos. Same line each time. The first two getting ignored. Round three, she eats it up, we link, we click. The end. Not a damn things changed on my end. It was all her.

**In Conclusion:**

Always swing. Keep on swinging even when you've struck out before. You can do everything right, miss once, knocking the next identical pitch out of the park. Sometimes you fail, completely out of your control. This is why you keep swinging when the same chance you want keeps knocking.

**Not Just Woman**

My sandwichman has two moods a great sandwich or a sub that's over the top. I frequent this sandwich shop where I regularly take people. The guy working every Sunday's name is Todd. Todd either makes my regular with two rolls of meat or three. Todd's a master sub maker. He spreads the sauce on both slices of bread. He cut's his foot longs in half, then half again, to make it easier to eat.  I've tried to figure it out, tipping him more but nothing I do seems to trigger the extra meat. The point is, I'm not changing a thing yet Todd gives me extra meat some Sundays verus not. The outcome of our interaction isn't controlled by my actions but his mood.

Because I know it's not me, my approach each Sunday is the same. My reaction is the same. Just like using the same profile and lines on the same match. *Don't string your self along.*",14,1

"Club ""game""","I posted not long ago about dancing in night clubs and getting IOIs that I could never capitalise on. 

My strategy was to dance by myself and show that I'm having a good time, I would make eye contact with a girl and she would smile and give me IOIs but when I started a conversation her body language would close up and attraction would drop.

Last night I went out and realized what I have been doing wrong. My mistake was I was being to respectful and conservative treating it like day game. There's nothing sexy about screaming small talk and saying ""what"" a million times because you can't hear over the music. 

The correct strategy in clubs is to dance alone, show you're having fun, and women will put themselves in your vicinity. Most often there back will be turned and they're dancing a few inches away from you, they put themselves there on purpose because they want you to grind on them.

Instead of putting your crotch in her ass immediately which takes away their plausible deniability, I found the best strategy is to put a hand on their hip and continue dancing. If they don't react this means you're in. You can now proceed to start grinding and touching the girl and after a minute spin her around to face you and make out with her. Once the attraction is built up you can start asking her name etc. Kiss some more, grab her ass, touch near her pussy a couple times and isolate and escalate till f close.

These girls are there to get FUCKED they don't want small talk and number closes. Be a man and give them what they want.",132,1

**Lesson:** The joke is that ""I wouldn't want to be part of the club that would have *someone like me* as a member."" Women gauge their value by the quality of men whom they chase- she wants the guy who's too good for her, and the idea of landing him- for a few weeks; for a few hours- is what turns her on. **The hyper-reality of online dating has created a sexual market where the slightest bit of percieved interest, respect, or admiration is a *complete turn off* for a woman.**

Welcome to hell.

""This guy treats everyone like shit. He thinks he's better than everyone. Why? If that's the case, then he must be really better, so that what he went through in the past molded him into the person he is today."" - This is Female Logic


Narcissists always have this delusion of grandeur where they think that they're better than anyone around, that they're even considering themselves something above a human.

This gives them the power to treat anyone as they want. 


Combined with delusions of grandeur and being driven by a dominancy pursuing behavior (just like women), narcissists make it their obsessions to come on top in anything. If they're wrong, they won't admit if they're not forced to, they're looking to get away just with anything. Basically, they're trying to get power in every way they can.


Women love that shit. They want a strong man who will make her think that he can take care of things, and will make her submit. A woman would even go as far as to accept the blame of something that they didn't do, if they're forced to, by a dominant man.  It's deeply embedded in femininity to submit to masculine. Even a masculine woman loves to submit, because she's feminine at core.

Narcissists are blame-shifting, emotionally disturbing. Opposite of our Nice Guy who has never been happy in his relationships, used by women as a wallet, got cheated on, never really found love.  

Treat a woman with respect, and she'll shit on you. Just because she can. That's what they were evolved to do. 

Shit on a woman, and she'll treat you with respect. Not saying you should, there are ways to get around it, but just saying what's gonna happen in result of what.

Only the paranoids survive (Emotional Investment)
-


It is generally believed that Narcissism stems from a superiority complex, but it's not like that. A person develops narcissism as a result of events that would otherwise make him go through unrecoverable emotional trauma.

Person starts off normal, then ends up with an inferiory complex as the result of one or both of these: 

1. Person gets told about his flaws (happens to low IQ more)

2. Person becomes aware of his own flaws (flaws that are maybe there, or not. a high IQ person might end up overthinking about normal aspects of himself, and create flaws in his own head. this is why a high IQ woman is able to rewrite reality better than a low IQ, they're good at creating scenarios. flaws could definitely be there too.) 


Then he repeats 1 and 2, or he goes through an event where he feels overly inferior, then Narcissism starts to develop in his psyche as a method of ""defensive compensation"" so that his newly-found feelings of superiority could counter-balance his feelings of inferiority and make him not go through an emotional trauma. 

Important sidenote: Narcissists usually have family issues that make them more emotional / fucked-up about everything. They can't handle emotions well. This plays a big role.  


After going through such events, the Narcissist has a new perspective on empathy / attachment / nurturing / caregiving. He decides that emotions, emotional investments make ONE vulnerable. (which they can, especially in a sexual relationship with a woman) 

They approach anyone who gives them love with precautions, they're always paranoid about people. They never try to give out weak spots, they never open up to someone. This is a strategy for the narcissist to never go through what he did before. 

Relationships become a war for them. A war where they can never tell the other party any affectionate things. Because if they do, the other party will exploit him using his feelings. (women will) 

Know what? Women love this shit too. They don't think that Narcissist has a problem expressing his feelings, women think that he has no feelings! Therefore, she must work hard to get his heart! 

Then she becomes Narcissist's narcissistic supply, he feeds his impulses off her. She gives her compliments, he gives her one tenth of what she gives. After a long time, if Narcissist becomes open to expressing his feelings, she thinks that she finally found true love! Why? Because she worked so hard for it! There are tons of men out there that are ready for a relationship with her right at that moment, but in her eyes, love is an important thing that must be won. You can't get it for free, or just for your appearence. Women are romance-y, they want to work for love, they want to suffer in the way of love. 

While she thinks that she's found true love, Narcissist thinks that he's found a new toy which he can use to make himself feel better / superior. (basically, she's a superiority dildo in his eyes)  


(women in general don't already appreciate men. narcissist women NEVER appreciate a man, she'll work hard to not make you feel important &amp; valuable. which is what a woman's true motive at her heart should be. get yourself relationships where you feel important &amp; valuable &amp; loved guys, that your happiness will be her happiness. she should work hard to make you happy.)

Mr.Hyde comes to visit our household occasionally (Emotional Rollercoasters)
-

If you ever got to know a narcissist personally, spent time with them, you'll know about this one. 

A narcissist usually have 2 mental states: Dr. Jekyll, and Mr. Hyde. 

When it's Dr. Jekyll, a narcissist is his usual-self. Irritating, disturbing, annoying, obsessive, dominancy-pursuing. Well, we already know about these. 

I said earlier that narcissism was a defensive compensation so that they wouldn't feel worse, when a narcissist is under stress, or going through an emotional breakdown, he'll double the fuck down on the defensive compensation. He'll take more compensation, meaning that he'll treat others even worse &amp; he'll try to create conflict out of nothing just to feel that superiority again. Because for him, it's the only way he can feel happy &amp; normal at that moment. 

He'll be far more disturbing, irritating and annoying than he ever was. This thing happens whenever they're just feeling down, so pretty common actually. In that stage, their sole purpose will be to make others feel inferior so they can feel superior again. 


Know what? Women love this shit too. A woman doesn't want to feel happy, she rather likes to feel things. Happiness &amp; sadness &amp; anger &amp; confusion, she wants to feel as much as she can, what feeling DOES NOT MATTER. But never one feeling for too long. Happy for long time, sexual attraction dies. She fucks another guy. Sad for long time, she starts resenting you. Then she fucks another guy for comeback + to feel happy again. Anger for too long? She fucks another guy for comeback. Confusion? She'll fuck her confusion. She'll just fuck if things get boring. This is why you pull &amp; push. 


Now, think about a narcissist. A narcissist sets new standards for a woman, when it comes to her feelings. Her standards to be happy decreases, and her tolerance for sadness increases. When a narcissist is under stress, he will explode at his woman. He will create conflict out of nothing, taking her happiness away from her. Then when things get back to normal, a narcissist will start acting normal (or even like a good person, so he could get his narcissistic supply back. just like how parents trick the children with candy), then the woman will be HAPPY again. 

As a result of this push &amp; pull, her AFFECTION for him will even increase. Because after feeling low, even little bits of good behaviour will make her feel like she found the cure for the cancer. Her emotions will be overclocked in this emotional rollercoaster. After each up &amp; down, next one will feel stronger. 


Predictability &amp; familiarity kills SEXUAL attraction. Go to DeadBedrooms, look at how many people have no problem on the surface there. Unfamiliarity &amp; unpredictability spins her hamster. 

(this is the way alpha-widows are made, best way to make an alpha widow is emotional-rollercoasters. emotional rollercoasters don't last forever, but they sure leave a mark on the psyche. maybe she turns out to be a narcissist in the aftermath as well, who knows.)

Women as some sort of a material
-

Materialism is a feminine trait because it shows money, and it comes down to value. It's really an easy way for women to distinguish value because money is a currency, and obviously a guy who has a Ferrari will have a massive advantage over a guy who's driving a 2002 Ford Explorer. 

But, despite being a feminine trait, Narcissists are materialists as well. Why? Because it's a way that they can feel superior than others. Basic trade, give X amount of money and get X amount of Narcissistic supply. It's really an accessible way for both women and narcissists to get what they want. Women use it to distinguish value (or providers), and Narcissists use it to feel superior. Fast food in the means of narcissistic supply. 


Now, a Narcissist makes the most of his surroundings. He tries to make everything into his narcissistic supply, he posts on social media, fishes for compliments, goes in front of the mirror and masturbates to himself, and even through his friends, he could signal value! If he has rich &amp; smart &amp; good looking friends, then that will mean that he's high-value as well that they picked The Narcissist as their friend. Thus, he will use his friends as a Narcissistic supply vaccine.

That applies to women too. A narcissist will know that his woman will also REPRESENT him, so that he'll choose his woman very carefully. As good looking as it gets, as rich as it gets, as smart as it gets. He'll have ridiculously higher standards than a lot of TRP men.

Know what? Women love this shit too. If a guy is picky about women, in a woman's eyes, it signals abundance and high value. Because a guy in scarcity doesn't get to choose, his dick just gets up whenever he sees a woman. But in reality, what the Narcissist has is just some set of unhealthy crazy obsessions. Both parties are way fucked up beyond repair at this point.  


(men should never care about a woman's money. only men who care about a woman's money are narcissists, sociopaths, feminine men who picked materialism up with social conditionining.)

Why it fails?
-

If you are a narcissistic self-centered jerk, then you're probably going to do much better than most of the bluepilled guys out there in a relationship.

But the thing is, Narcissism is a MENTAL DISORDER. It's basically high ego that comes with high insecurity and women tier emotions. If you have high insecurity, women will sniff that out and use it to weed you out. 

When a person's ego is that high, there are also more components that are creating that ego. It's also easier to break it if you get a whiff of his insecurities. 

Women are like dogs whenever it comes to this, they can sniff insecurity very well and they will use it to attack you. A narcissist would most of the time dominate the woman though, but don't underestimate women in that matter.


And biggest reason why Narcissism as a SEXUAL STRATEGY does not work: 

Most of the male narcissists are feminine, momma's boys. They become that way because they're already in hunger for validation and love, and emotionally fucked up.

Being feminine and thinking so highly of themselves at the same time brings their downfall: 

They do not initiate with women. And women almost never initiate. (and good women never initiate. not that good woman would get into a relationship with a narcissist though) 

Think about it like this: You have tons of thirsty males just drooling at this moment for you, just because you have tits and a vagina. That would make you think highly of yourself, and you would never approach a male. Even if you were interested, you'd just signal that you're interested, you'd not do anything solid.

With narcissists, it works the same way. Since you think that you're of high value, you don't go to doorsteps and sell yourself, that's not how a high-value product is sold (except for Vault-Tec shelters), you wait for the buyer to come and buy the product. 

And since both parties think the same way, they just don't initiate and it becomes a stalemate.


Masculine male narcissists don't have this problem since they go for what they want with agression, they grab and take it. They only got the former problem about insecurities.



Last things I'm going to say, vet your fucking friends well. Get the narcissists out of your life. They don't appreciate things &amp; conflict seeking &amp; will do anything for attention. Narcissism comes with predatory inclinations, so if a girl wants to dominate you on bed, handcuff you, she's a predatory woman (masculine, narcissist or both). Either way, get her the fuck out of your life.  



(they might be picking up ""not approaching"" - ""not looking thirsty"" thing from their woman friends through social conditionining as well. but this not initiating thing is a feminine trait, and probably an instinct. i don't know if how it works on narcissists and women are same.)

Made a Fake Tinder Profile as a Woman,"I know this is weird...

But I've been using dating apps like Tinder and Hinge for about 4+ years now. I had a lot more success with it in college. Things have slowed down now. Even though I'm getting matches they weren't leading up to anything. (Could be COVID).

Anyways, I had some free time and decided to run a little experiment. I made a fake profile as a hot female to see what the competition pool was like. And holy fuck was my mind blown....

Within the first 10 minutes approximately 100 likes. The profiles ranged from a wide scale of different types of guys.

I already learned my lesson in this short time frame. 

**CONCLUSION:** GET OFF TINDER.

There are infinite choices for women on Tinder, although they may be shitty, they still have way more options than men. Not only that, they are consistently being validated by dudes complimenting them or asking them out on a date. 

It is almost impossible to make yourself standout in dating apps versus cold approaching. Sure you can use dating apps on the side, but don't make it your sole source of meeting women.

Also I only did this experiment on Tinder and not on other dating apps because I'm lazy and I just wanted to do a quick and easy experiment. I'm sure on other dating sites you can make yourself stand out even more.

**SIDE NOTE:**

For those who are skeptical or need a major perspective shift, I recommend you try out the same experiment. I only needed 10 minutes to realize this. 

Also, yes I've had many lays from Tinder. I'm not knocking the app. I just think that Tinder culture has shifted dramatically away from the favor of men. If you disagree, feel free to leave your opinion in the comments. I would love to hear your perspective.",146,1
The End of Democracy Part 1: Tech Knights and Machine Emperors,"**The End of Democracy Part 1: Tech Knights and Machine Emperors**

**Intro:**

When the Wright Brothers achieved powered flight for the first time in history, many brilliant minds attempted to make predictions about the future of aviation.

Virtually all of them were too optimistic.

* National flight based taxi service!
* Personal airplanes for every citizen!
* Some even predicted that everyone would use rocket ships to travel anywhere in the world instantly

You see this overly-optimistic view about just how far new technology can go over and over again.

When scientists first created amino acids synthetically, people were jumping up and down, predicting the rise of cloning and artificial test tube babies!

The truth is, it‚Äôs virtually impossible to make accurate predictions about the future of technology by simply extrapolating current trends.

It just doesn‚Äôt work that way.

Which means you can relax about all the doomsday predictions about Humanity getting taken over by Artificial Intelligence. The people predicting that machines will take over the world just because they can beat people in Chess now are the same people that would have predicted that everyone would have a personal airplane by the year 2000.

Which leads to the question, what exactly can you predict?

**Body:**

Well, one of the easiest things you can predict about the future is that human nature never really changes.

You'll find that despite all the changes in technology, we‚Äôre still the same power hungry status obsessed apes we always were, just with guided missiles now instead of rocks.

Which brings us to the first immutable law of history:

**1. Societies naturally optimize themselves for War. Any society that does not will be absorbed by one that does.**

The most dominant cultures in history have always held the [Monopoly On Violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence).

From the Rome to The United States, you will never find a great nation without a history of success on the battlefield.

And the battlefield is utterly ruthless. The battlefield doesn‚Äôt care about right or wrong, only what is effective or not.

A lot of people believe that Rome collapsed because they got lazy. But if you put the pieces together, you‚Äôll see that laziness is just the symptom, not the cause of the decline.

The truth is, Rome got lazy because highly trained, well equipped heavy infantry simply weren‚Äôt as effective on the battlefield as before.

Cavalry was beginning to stand out from all other branches of the military as the single most important unit on the battlefield.

You already see glimpses of this with Julius Caesar, who won battles he wasn‚Äôt supposed to win and transformed Rome from a Republic into an Empire largely because he [mastered the use of cavalry](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/featured/caesars-elite-germanic-cavalry.html) before anyone else in Rome.

And after Atilla the Hun rode into Rome on newly invented Stirrups, there simply wasn‚Äôt any hope for infantry anymore.

Because the Roman people never really developed an elite cavalry culture within Rome itself‚Ä¶ They had to rely more and more on auxiliary cavalry units from their allies and colonies.

Why bother investing in educating, equipping, and drilling an entire army of Legionnaires when you can accomplish more on the battlefield by simply paying a bunch of big German dudes who have been riding horses since they were born?

Rome was already militarily dead as a civilization the moment other armies proved that you can use an army of elite cavalry to crush armies of infantry 10X bigger. It‚Äôs actually quite impressive that they managed to sputter on and survive for as long as they did.

A lot of people also hold the belief that Civilization as a whole went backwards after Rome fell and Europe descended into the ‚ÄúDark Ages‚Äù of Feudalism. But if you look at Feudalism from the context of military technology &amp; tactics, it actually makes perfect sense.

If the only thing that matters in a military conflict is how good your Cavalry are, doesn‚Äôt it make a lot more sense to put everything into training a small group of Elite Nobles from birth to ride and fight on horseback than to educate your entire population of peasants and teach them how to fight?

Concepts like traditional masculinity and individual freedom will always wax and wane with the rise and fall of civilizations but Military Technology &amp; Tactics never go backward, only forward.

As long as an elite group of Cavalry were the most crucial units in a War, then society will naturally optimize itself for producing the most well-trained elite cavalry. Any society that does not will be taken over by one that does.

I know we all like to think that we started coming to our senses and [launching revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution) against oppressive monarchies because people started to value their freedom more, but what if [people have always valued freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_M%C3%BCntzer), and it‚Äôs only recently that Guns have broken the military supremacy of cavalry?

Which leads to a very interesting conclusion:

The greater the power of the infantryman on the battlefield, the more freedom there is in society and the better life is for the average man.

The more a small group of Elite units are the main deciding factor in whether a battle is won or lost, the less freedom for the average man.

It may take time for society to catch up to advances in military technology, but eventually cultures will always be optimized for military performance.

2000 years ago, Rome thrived under a [Representative Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy) that prioritized the rights of the individual because training a group of average infantrymen so well they‚Äôre able to [rotate men in and out of the frontlines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7MYlRzLqD0) was the best way to ensure success on the battlefield.

2000 years later, The United States of America thrived the same way because Large Scale Warfare in the age of gunpowder means that having a huge population of well educated, relatively free men is the best way to achieve military supremacy. We just happened to have the right society for best waging war, which nobody was even really sure of before the two world wars removed all doubt. 

So now that we know society changes as a result of military innovation, the question becomes: in which direction are things going?

It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to see that unfortunately, infantry isn‚Äôt the most important component of a modern military anymore ‚Äì [air power is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dHOGsZivIo&amp;has_verified=1).

Is it just a coincidence that life became worse for the average man in The United States after the Gulf War when the government discovered that just a few precision guided weapons delivered from high tech aircraft can win a war faster than drafting and training 2.2 million fighting men did in Vietnam? 

Did money get involved in politics because corporations got more and more selfish over time, or were business interests [always selfish and self-serving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#:~:text=In%20United%20States%20history%2C%20the,and%20the%20Western%20United%20States.), but it was only after Raytheon demonstrated that guided missiles matter a lot more than training millions of soldiers that the people in charge decided, ‚ÄúOk, to hell with empowering the individual, let‚Äôs just invest in building the best aircraft and guided missiles‚Äù?

And unfortunately, with the way technology is developing today, things are about to get even more lopsided.

**Machine Learning** ‚Äì Again, you don‚Äôt have to be a genius to realize that if you can train a machine to get better and better at a specific task over time, then eventually, [you won‚Äôt even need human pilots anymore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-9_Reaper).

To make a long story short, in order to teach a machine learning algorithm how to get better and better at a specific task over time, for example, recognizing faces or winning a game of Chess, all you need to do is feed it more and more human generated data until eventually, it [just does the job better than any human ever could](https://healthitanalytics.com/news/google-deep-learning-tool-99-accurate-at-breast-cancer-detection).

What does this mean for you?

If you hate solving [captchas](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205610/google-captcha-ai-robot-human-difficult-artificial-intelligence) before you can log into a site, I got news for you.

It‚Äôs not hard at all to imagine a future where your workday consists of solving Captchas or identifying hills in images in order to feed precious human generated data to a machine learning algorithm so your company can develop the next great automation product, or your country can win the next great war.

And the funny thing is, there will probably be hordes of betas reading this going, ‚ÄúYAY, Now I can get paid for tangible results instead of this wishy-washy office politics shit!‚Äù

Sigh, there will always be people who enjoy plowing the fields, or working in factories, or solving captchas. Most people just love doing braindead work with measurable increments of progress. Human nature never really changes.

**CRISPR Gene Editing** ‚Äì Imagine if you could change the individual genes in your DNA to cut out the genes you do want and replace them with better genes.

CRISPR basically uses Viruses - which naturally infiltrate cells and modify their Nucleus to produce nothing but more viruses until it explodes ‚Äì to specifically cut and paste genes into your cell‚Äôs DNA instead.

What does this mean for you?

Unfortunately, it just means the elite just entrench their positions even more.

Look what happened with steroids, something that is demonstrated to improve muscle growth and athletic performance. Banned everywhere except in cases of muscle wasting disease.

And half the people who take them illegally to get an unfair advantage don‚Äôt even look like they lift, because regardless of how many steroids they take, you still have to train hard at the gym and be disciplined in your diet to get a muscular body.

Ask yourself, does the average man look better today with widespread underground steroid usage or in in the 1900‚Äôs before steroids were invented?

It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to predict that more or less the same shit is going to happen with CRISPR gene editing technology.

Deemed too dangerous to use by governments who want to maintain power over their people‚Ä¶

That won‚Äôt stop the black market from fulfilling that built in demand for shortcuts. But the vast majority of people still won‚Äôt achieve remarkable things in their field, even with perfect genes because of the very fact they‚Äôre looking for that shortcut instead of doing the hard work.

Just like steroids made elite bodybuilding physiques significantly bigger than [before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Sandow), I suspect that CRISPR will do the same to the productive capabilities of elite individuals who know how to combine artificial help with a good foundation of hard work and discipline, but won‚Äôt do anything to help the prospects of the average man, who will still complain that life isn‚Äôt fair.

**What Does This Mean For Society?**

It means that we are going to enter a new age of Authoritarianism or Feudalism, depending on who wins, one powerful individual (like Julius Caesar) or a group of powerful elites (Dark Ages).

Enter the Tech Knight.

Enter the Machine Learning Emperor.

Wars today are still relatively combined arms affairs, even if air power takes a disproportionate role. You can‚Äôt have an army of just aircraft, you still need infantry to hold enemy territory resistance is cleared out.

You can‚Äôt have an army of just tanks, they‚Äôll just get wiped out by Helicopters before they can fire a shot.

In such an environment, it still makes sense to have a well-educated society with individual rights because you still need soldiers who can think on their feet and take the initiative themselves, not mindless drones.

But the wars in the future will not need this same level of coordination.

Genghis Khan conquered the world with a much smaller army than his opponents, and he didn‚Äôt need to mix in any infantry. He had an army of pure Cavalry, supplemented with auxiliary units recruited from conquered territories. He had the best army because they were the best at riding and fighting on horseback. Nothing more. Nothing less.

Similarly, whenever the next major war breaks out, whoever is better at utilizing AI will win.

A tank is nothing but a sitting duck if you can unleash a horde of cheap suicide drones to burrow underneath and explode.

You won‚Äôt need infantry when they have cheap machines that can patrol the streets 24/7 and can more accurately determine friend from foe than any human.

 You won‚Äôt even need the trained fighter pilots anymore when AI controlled aircraft, who don‚Äôt need to worry about innate human physiological limitations like G-Force can fly circles around even the best human pilot.

In such a world, the only thing that matters is which group of people is the best at using Artificial Intelligence to wage war.

Nobody really knows what the individual units will look like, whether we‚Äôll have mobile war factories producing hordes of drones to best fit changing battlefield needs, or if we‚Äôll have special forces go in and designate targets before the entire area is wiped out with AI controlled drones.

But we do know that regardless of what form he takes, the ‚ÄúTech Knight‚Äù will mean increasingly more power in the hands of a small group of elites.

All we know for sure is that Democracy‚Äôs time in the sun will come to an end, just like it did before. You won‚Äôt need strong, free individuals when a small group of elite tech knights is the only thing stopping your country from getting conquered by another group of people.

**What Does This Mean For You?**

It means you now have unprecedented opportunities to grab generational power for your family if you play your cards right.

Remember, human nature never changes. The skills needed to lead large groups of people always remain the same throughout history. If you want to be CEO of a military drone company, you‚Äôre going to need to know how to hold frame and sell your ideas to others, learning to code is useful but not sufficient.

You‚Äôre always going to need discipline and hard work to succeed in anything you do, which most people don‚Äôt have. That never really changes either.

And if you're smart enough, you'll use new technologies to get an advantage over your competitors before everyone else, like using CRISPR to edit out bad genes from you and your children.

Should you escape America and go somewhere else?

Honestly, I don‚Äôt have an answer to that question. There‚Äôs arguments both ways.

Octavian Caesar, the first emperor of Rome hid out in the countryside, gradually consolidating his power while the elites destroyed themselves in the city.

On the other hand, many successful revolutionaries were the original leader of their country‚Äôs revolutionary movement meaning they were involved in the thick of things right from the beginning ‚Äì Lenin and Mao fall into this category. 

But regardless of what you decide, the important thing is that you are ready to fight for power when the time comes.

Simple Will and fighting spirit are not enough. It‚Äôs helpful, and society often changes when a small group of committed &amp; determined individuals take collective action together, but remember that when an Apache helicopter can mow down 50 terrorists at a time (all willing to die for their cause), you know that you also need to control the instruments of war.

America is not in as bad a spot as you think. Silicon Valley is still the center of tech. We still have the best Universities in the country.

But they are overwhelmingly liberal institutions.

If you wish to determine the direction the country will be headed in, you must have at least a basic understanding of Machine Learning and if possible, own the company that is producing the tech.

The gun enthusiasts on RedPill who think that their guns will actually do anything to stop them from being taken into FEMA camps are about to get a rude awakening when drones patrol every neighborhood in the country and they get mowed down from the sky before they can even see what hit them.

If you don‚Äôt want Google to control your life...

If you have any desire to maintain your independence and power in the future, then you must either start your own company that specializes in AI or work for someone else who does, preferably someone who agrees with your world views.

Right wing culture is fundamentally more friendly to militarism than the left, but now it must learn to combine this military culture with tech.

No tech, no power.

Do not be afraid to infiltrate large tech companies in the beginning, just to get your foot in the door and learn the inner workings so you can later start your own company.

The left infiltrated Colleges and Universities, there‚Äôs no reason you can‚Äôt do the same to Tech.

Because when the next World War arrives, you don‚Äôt want to be stuck with no useful skills or alliances‚Ä¶

"Are my standards going up, or are woman just aging?","Hi everyone. 30 year old checking in. 

For most of my life I have found the bulk of woman attractive if they have a cute face and aren't morbidly obese. 

It seems in the past year that something has flipped and I am finding most woman unattractive. High hairline, bad skin, wrinkles, fat in the wrong places. Horrible voices and personalities.  

Keep in mind this is coming from someone who hasn't been in many relationships and pretty low confidence. I am not ugly or overweight. My standards have never been high. I have never been able to pull woman. But after being in a few bad relationships, I have naturally started to rapidly develop standards and I would rather have not  have sex / be in a relationship at all than with someone I don't find attractive... but it seems like I am finding less and less woman attractive. 

Am I developing standards, or are the bulk of woman losing their looks SO FAST already due to age and neglect to look after themselves? I can't tell!!!!

Not sure if this is the right question for the right forum.. but ON TOPIC, after many years of hearing about it I am finally 3/4 through the rational male. Not really waking up or anything, just reinforcing concepts!

103 Basics: Play Chess While Everyone Else Is Playing Checkers,"Hello!  


\[Obligatory\] Happy Cake Day to me! **Nobody cares!** Let's get into it.   


Today is about attempting to help encourage people to figure out their lives, and what they want out of life. A shocking amount of younger guys I talk to do not know, and many more I interact with have vague answers (which is alright!) but don't have definitive objectives declared. I then started asking people in my peer groups and slightly older (30's) and realized that *an astonishing amount of people have no clue what the literal fuck they are doing with their own lives!* So, here we are.  


As always, the standard disclaimers apply with my posts. This is for those who are rather new(er) to the TRP scene and need some initial guidance and instruction. I personally believe the post quality has gone down and the majority of the old guard are moving on or washing out, and these posts are to help pass down generational wisdom to the new 'freshmen class' as the old class are now 'veterans' and it is now time to pay it forward and pass down our combined knowledge before we lose the community and our principles entirely.

# This week's topic: Play Chess While Everyone Else Is Playing Checkers

This shit is about overall life strategy. I won't lie to you, I'm kind of *fucking* stupid. I am sure you are too. That's okay, fellow idiot, because you are taking the necessary steps to increase your overall intelligence. The best way to defeat our inherent stupidity and shortcomings is to Read, and Think. Shit's that simple, post is over goodbye everyo--  


**No**. Not that simple. Not At All.   


If you are younger especially, (18-25) range, there's alot of shit that benefits you the sooner you figure it out. You need to figure *yourself* out. Everyone is different and I cannot dictate exactly what is 'missing' or what may work best for you, but everyone has something going on we need to fix, and everyone has goals, dreams, and ambitions. Or at least they *should,* theoretically speaking. We need to plan, for our own lives, for ourselves. If you're under a certain age or maturity level, I can assure you that most of the people around you have not spent any time thinking about their 5, 10 or 15 year plans and have no clue what the fuck they are doing with themselves. ***And that is a fucking problem.***

You need to be cold and calculating, you need to perform value assessments on all the relationships and people around you, and start understanding how your own actions contribute towards your goals. Figure your career out, your hobbies, your goals as early as possible. Build a mental picture of the lifestyle you want to have, and ask yourself questions about that vision. Do you want to own pets? What kind of housing do you want? Do you want a career or job that has you travel alot? Are you going to sell out and have a family one day? Do you wish to have expensive hobbies? What about having a home office? How long do you want your ideal commute to be? Beach, City, or Mountains? Read and research as much as you can about all your goals, attempt to meet people who have already achieved what you're looking for, and find out the fastest way to get there. If you want to work on exotic cars, why are you an electrician? If you want to write books, why aren't you writing and improving?   


In my experience, even well meaning people would give me bad advice to 'help' me achieve my goals and they couldn't be farther from the truth. It is imperative you learn *how* to ask questions, and *who* to ask the *right* questions. There are many pathways but only a few small roads to actually get to your destination.

Assess all your interactions against your objectives and plan accordingly, determine how all your relationships and your family, your friends fall in line with your objective. If you want to be a millionaire with **Fuck You** money, what kind of effort are you putting into that goal? Do you have those kinds of wealthy people around you, do you have access to those social circles? If you want to be ripped and jacked as shit, how much effort are you putting into the gym? Are the closest people around you picking up heavy shit and putting it back down on a consistent basis? Ask yourself how all your relationships serve you, and then ask yourself how you spend your time and which hobbies further your goals. **It's a War of Attrition, a War of Inches, where you must put in small effort consistently over a long period of time to yield the results that you want.**

Sorry bruv, Living your life to chase women is not a plan.

If you're reading TRP because you're only here to 'learn how to game women' or 'just impress women' or 'chase after that one girl' then you're here for the completely wrong reasons. Close the tab, log out, never come back here. **You should be here for nobody else but Yourself.**   
As a reminder, we absolutely do not do this shit for women, we do it **for Ourselves.** The key here is that when you're in your primary unshakeable frame, women will naturally fall into line with what YOU want as that submissiveness is part of their nature intrinsically. Of course there are exceptions to the rules and blah blah, but as a generality if you had the confidence and social graces, the sex appeal, the body, the values, personality, and resources, that internal character and fortitude, then what they ""want"" doesn't matter because as a high value man you dictate the terms and conditions of the relationship and every interaction. ""Learning Game"" is only effective when there is an already existing foundation of having your life together and already having figured shit out. Sure, homeless dudes and jailbirds can pull, but they're also fucking around with mentally damaged, medium- or low- value women anyway, and none of us want you picking through the dregs involuntarily. 

Most guys haven't really seen it or know, but I assure you all the ""bad behaviors"" we on TRP love to bitch about evaporate when you have enough of the ""stuff"". For the right types of men, the vast majority of women will (at least temporarily) throw out the social programming of feminism and cock carousel. It's in their nature to ride the carousel, so don't get fooled by the temporary changes, but the right guy can quite easily mold many women to their desires and all the bullshit goes right out the window. If they're so indoctrinated that they still double down on their feminist ideals and ideology, then simply toss them as they are ultimately more of a liability than an asset and could compromise your entire operation. This also goes for non-sextual relationships; people who don't believe in your vision need to be ejected immdiately especially when they take more from you than they give. **Take the garbage to the curb outside where it belongs.**  


In my personal experience (and I'm sure many others can attest), they don't even know what they want half the time anyway and crafting an image that fulfills their agenda misses the mark, every time, because it's inauthentic and operating on someone else's agenda for your life which automatically gives them the upper hand during interactions, even subconsciously.  


**Repeat after me, out loud, to yourself: "" We Men do not exist to serve the fickle whims of Women. We serve Ourselves, First** **^((and maybe God if you're of the religious persuasion))****"".**  


It's better to focus on yourself and constantly be improving so you can be in the niche group of Men who dictate the terms of their every engagement with women with a massive strategic advantage by virtue of their social status. Without a plan, without a strategy, without motivation, it is difficult to stay on your course and to live your own life the way that you want. 

Make bank, lift heavy shit, dress well, be interesting, create a life insulated from outside influence that you want to live, don't compromise on how you want to live and filter out people who aren't conducive to these goals. Then keep at it and continue refining, evolving, and improving til you're fucking dead.

The REAL way to get LAID with Instagram,"Has anyone noticed the absurdly large amount of PUAs and their followers on Instagram who market themselves as *multi-millionaire alpha party having playboys?*

It's so annoying to get ANOTHER follow request from some gumpy looking dude in an ill fitting blazer, taking posed pictures with hired models or sub-par looking women, using the same cookie cutter ""Alpha Playboy"" instagram template all the other nerds use, then calling himself a social media mogul. Don't forget how he takes 17 pictures in one night, from one party, then spaces out uploading them so it looks like he's constantly being invited to ""upscale events.""

All the ideas those guys try to sell you on... this whole, ""Creating a Fear Of Missing Out"" for your audience! Or, ""Projecting a life of high value and abundance!"" I'm here to tell you it's all bullshit and unnecessary. 

Now you have one question you need to answer before continue reading this post; Who would you rather take advice from?

The gump I described earlier, who specializes in making average, cashier job-having nobodies portray a ""high value upscale"" life they don't actually have, whilst having an inbox filled with guys asking them if it's high value to take photos in front of restaurants they can't actually afford?

Or the fuckboi taking a simple mirror selfie, showing off his messy hair and outfit for the day, or a picture of him and the gang, that gets 100's of likes per picture, plenty of comments, and has an inbox full of girls who DM him?

If you still want advice from the first guy, Dan Bilzerian has been exposed as a fraud, your king has fallen. If you wanna hear from the second guy, however, I can only assume you wanna learn how it actually works, and make sure it's done right...


***

The advice here, whilst most applied towards Instagram, can be tailored towards any social media platform, be it Facebook, Twitter, youtube, Etc.

Social media should be viewed as a passive pussy generator -- if you keep up an attractive profile while living life you will have AT LEAST 1 new cute girl in your city DM you, while having at least another 1 open to being DM'd you. That's at the very least. In my heigh-day I banged 3 girls in one week from Facebook, and one became an LTR. But all of this is a passive source, meaning you aren't relying on this to bring you all the women in your life.

**Actually getting laid on Social media consists of 3 simple but important factors --**

1.) How many followers/friends do you have

2.) How much engagement do your posts get (Likes/comments/shares/retweets)

3.) The content of your posts

That's literally it.

Let's break them all down:

*1.) You only need an above average amount of followers.* You don't need to have a ridiculous follower count in the tens or hundreds of thousands to get laid. I had like, 4k, back when I used IG every day, and I just signed in after 3 years of absence and still have 2.5k. 

*Well wait a minute how do I get a large amount of followers?*

**Easy. You fucking talk to people and become friends with them.** Instead of just asking for phone numbers with the guys and girls you meet at work, at school, your hobbies, where-ever, you throw out the idea of exchanging social media as well. I did that shit all throughout college and highschool. Let's say you don't have any friends in real life and lack the gall to make them, well online friends are fine too. I probably have 500 online friends spread across facebook and instagram, and I met them doing random shit, youtube networking, joining facebook groups and talking, playing videogames, whatever. The point is you can find friends, network, and exchange social medias with them as easy as 1,2,3. If you have some kind of online hobby or business, redirecting your fans from their to your other social medias is another solution.

*2.) Your posts need to have high engagement.* There is nothing more fraudulent than a guy with 10k followers yet only 5 likes per photo on his IG. Do you idiots really think we can't see through your fa√ßade? This is the point that completely cracks the ""high value,"" myth, because the fuckboys that take normal pictures of themselves, in their bedroom, but then ALL their boys like and comment on it, the girls in his social circles like and comment on them, and now he has a resume to fuck some pussy. 

*Well how do I generate high engagement with my posts?*

**You remember all those people you networked and exchanged IG's with? You need to actually fucking talk to them!** No one is going to like and comment on your pictures if a.) they don't like you as a person or b.) you don't like or comment on their posts. You need to make a human effort to at least maintain appearances with these people. You need to have the superficial small talk and shoot the shit with the people you meet. Give them positive vibes. Make them feel good around you, and have them feeling like something is missing when you're gone. Then when they see ""So and So has liked your picture"" they're gonna think ""Oh hey it's so and so! Lemme go like and comment on his latest picture too."" That's literally how this shit works. Not only will they reciprocate with your likes and comments, but them doing so actually bumps up your exposure, the more people that interact with your posts, the more other people will see them. It's a self fulfilling prophecy. If you find you have alot of followers, people you talk to, yet no one is liking your posts, hate to break it to you but you really aren't that popular and not alot of people like you. Fix that. (Fixing that situation deserves a post on its own.) 

**3.) The content of your posts needs to reflect who you are as a person.** Taking a posed picture in front of a Ferrarri because you want to convey a high value image? Cornball. Taking an authentic picture next to a ferrarri with a look of excitement on your face because you're a genuine ""car guy"" and everyone knows you love cars? In coming likes and comments that say ""Wow that must have been a nice show!"" ""Lmao your dream came true huh bro,"" ""Oh wow that looks fun bring me next time xoxo"". 

Two sub-sections of advice no. 3 are these: 1-- Your content needs to make you look good. No photos of your bruised face with the caption ""I just got my ass kicked,"" no ugly photos of yourself. This doesnt mean you can't have sad posts, like your pet just passed away and you're mourning them, or angry posts, like some jackass ran a red light and crashed into your car. Infact, intense emotions are a great thing when it comes to human interaction, being able to invoke them in others consistently forces them to invest in you, and remember, pictures tell a 1000 words...  2-- Your content needs to reflect your persona/image/vibe.  If you are actually a businessman, taking pictures of yourself with your suit and tie, and briefcase, ""on the move"" is genuine and you should go for it. I personally have that guerrilla/artist vibe, so I take pictures of me painting, me with friends smoking, me teaching my girlfriend how to shoot guns, etc. 

*Well how do I reflect who I am as a person on my instagram?* 

**Uh I dont know by actually being a fucking person?** If you're boring you will never get laid. Become interesting and develop a personality through exploring and sticking to some hobbies. I painted, made movies, and music. All this was on Instagram. I would make super-sped up clips of ""Painting Time with Aftsov"" and would time lapse myself painting shit. People could see me in the video painting my shit. 

**Instagram, and all social media, is a supplement to an already good life. Not a substitute for a lacking life.**

Trust me, whenever there's some random nobody dude from college taking posed pictures of themselves in a suit trying hard to portray a life they don't actually have, the shit is see through and transparent. You think you're being dark triad and Machiavellian but it's actually being retarded. It's damn near 2021, PUA's are a known meme, and if you're still following the cookie cutter social media profile tips then everyone you know is gonna think you're a fucking meme, too.

You mean to actually tell me that some of you stupid ass niqq√°s out there, [come across a guy like this with pictures like this](https://ibb.co/k8gWwpw) fall for it, call it genuine, then ask how you can replicate his profile and success?

My niqq√° is you serious?! IDK if you ever read ""The game"" by Neil Strauss, *but the guy calls out the majority of PUA's, who take money from lonely desperate incels, then go out and fuck a bunch of hookers, then take pictures of them so it looks like they get real pussy, then sell it back to the incels and it's a fucking circle.* Don't be one of them.

Now finally before you tell me you need to have a 6 foot 4 chad fizeek with a male model's face, you need to STFU right now. I could use myself as an example to shatter every one of those tired cliches, but I wont, instead I'll use my friend, who is objectively shorter, fatter, and uglier than me, yet still is a social expert and is able to date hot women. He has such abundance that 2 weeks ago, he started dating a hot latina chick, only for him to dump her because she said her Ex is still in the picture. ""Yeah man I dont like that shit, dont got the time to deal with that,"" he told me. Mad respect, K.G. You suck but still, mad respect. He has 1000's of friends/followers on facebook/Instagram, and I have not seen a single status that gets under 50 likes, nor a photo upload that gets less than 100. Let that be a lesson and example to all you down on your luck sad-sacks.


***

**BONUS**

Earlier I mentioned going dark triad on social media, and being Machiavellian, well here's how you actually do it:

For every real girl on social media that likes and comments on your shit, create a fake (but real looking) female profile and do the same thing. Make it look genuine, but set it on private so no one can investigate. Follow random people so they follow back, but no one you really know. Eventually you will have 4-8 fake hot girl profiles that constantly comment and like your shit, and remember they're really you, so you can comment whatever you want, and boom, now more sluts wanna have sex with you cus if they see other girls want you they want you too. I have a friend who's done it a few times with great success.

[If you wanna read more about that method, read the story of the Machievellian guy from the bodybuilding forums -- he did it and banged 2 sluts for free.](https://www.forums.red/p/TheRedPill/448/machiavellian_bodybuilder_miscer_has_faked_high_status_on_fa/110835/)",183,1

Pissed off at how friends are the ones who want you to fail the most[RANT!],"I fucking hate this shit. How my closest friends are the ones that are most bitter about my success. I can't even talk to them about shit I do anymore because they just take the piss in attempts to (what it feels like) knock me off centre. There are a few good groups of friends I have that are actually okay, but these are the people who have no common interests with the business.

It's fucking annoying. Why the fuck do they laugh at my attempts when they are my friends (or were)? They just overlook my shit and ignore it. Surely they should have been the ones the happiest for this shit. But they're not. The only one who seems to value my shit is the competitors to my business - and people I haven't even met(people who know about the company more than they do me). The annoying part is if we just all got together as one big team we could actually make this business even better - they have options to be apart of it. It makes me think I'm a shit leader, or maybe other people don't want success as I do. We literally have the team to change the cities, possibly countries, music scene (I own a record label, think DJs, Producers, Night clubs, we are all young and are actually a unique set of people with some talent) but they just don't fucking realise this shit. We all once raved &amp; clubbed together, and we could team together to make big changes, but the people I need the most are the ones looking in the opposite direction the most. 

Or maybe they suffer from imposter syndrome, thinking that we aren't good enough to achieve this shit. But these limiting beliefs fuck me off even more. Its unrealised potential in people to do great and influence many many people.

I really just needed to fucking swear this bollocks out of my brain and TRP feels like the only place in the world that is on the same wavelength as me with crab in a bucket mentality draining the soul out of the few guys who learn how to be successful, in the top %, with cunts pulling you down. So thank you for allowing me to do this.",20,1

The gym gloves,"I walk into my 100% authentic Muay Thai gym. Class starts in 5 minutes, so I begin to stretch.

I look around and see my teammates are strapping their gloves, so I begin looking for mine. I come to an evil realization: I forgot them.

Everyone is starting at me, and in my trance of forgetfulness I realize I've been making eye contact with the head coach. The wise sensei is well aware of the look on my face. The look of forgetfulness. The look of dread. The contemplation, the supposition: ""what the fuck should I do""

The head coach nods to the gym gloves.

The gyms gloves have a long history. Who knows how long they've been in the gym for. Rumors were, that what those now gym gloves once were, were ordinary gloves. They belonged to a person. Who knows why he left them. Obviously enough though, they weren't his prize possession, they were just some gloves he didn't give a fuck about.

Another story was that the coach had an extra pair, and because he has a lot of pairs, he designated a pair for those who forget their gloves.

The luckiest person was the first person to wear them.

Assuming it was the coaches pair, never before used, he just got to use a fresh pair of gloves that are at their absolute peak in quality. Fuck yeah. He gets to try on some new gloves, go home back to his old gloves, and forget he ever tried them on. He gets too laugh at all of the next guys who will use the gloves that he broke in.

If the rumors are true, that it was once some persons gloves, not the coaches, and he just forgot about them, then yeah, its kinda nasty, it had another person sweat and skin cells festering in there, but it wasn't too bad. It was a lesson: never let this happen to you, ever again. Never put yourself in this position, ever again.

For the next man though, it will be the same as every man after him. It was already bad. 1-2 people already went through the infamous gym gloves. The chance of catching ring worm, or a whole host of skin diseases, is extremely high now. Even if you ignore the diseases, the gloves have a distinct smell that will never leave them no matter how many times they've been washed. When he takes them off, his hands have a nasty feeling to them. Is this a placebo or not? Who knows. But he quickly goes home to shower. He's disgusted with himself. This will be the story of every man from this point on, except the disgust of the gym gloves will only grow for each man afterwards. At this point, the logical decision would be to just burn them, but nobody wants to touch them, not even the outer part.

Everyones staring at you. ""Hey man, class is about to start, put those fucking gloves on.""

You come to your sense: ""Fuck guys, im just gonna go home and jack off""",29,1

For those unfamiliar, we are running a biweekly call in show where we talk a specific subject but welcome any callers. 

#If you're reading, submit a question. You'll do a lot better than askTRP. 


----------------

For those not familiar with the channel, we're working on producing voice and video content that's a bit more in line with TRP.

""Red Pill"" has been co-opted by a lot of morons who would be laughed out of the sub, especially on YouTube. /u/rpu_mike and I have been covering a lot of the sidebar in a new format through RP University, and doing interviews with various relevant characters and the occasional EC.

This show will be interactive to the extent we have questions that follow rule zero, with DTC (usually here, out this week) and /u/itiswr1tten working directly with call ins.

The general theme of the show is, much like the radio shows before us, the RP way to deal with sexual strategy, having a good time, and otherwise the degenerate shit you get into when you're out playing the field.

Comprehensive Guide On How To Be More Natural In Conversations With Girls,"&amp;#x200B;

**Intro:**

Does it ever feel like there‚Äôs two You‚Äôs?

Normal You

And Tryhard You

Normal You is how you normally act around family and friends. You can joke around and not take anything they say too seriously.

Normal You holds frame effortlessly when the people from work give you shit after your favorite football team loses

But as soon as it‚Äôs time to talk to that girl you like, or that hot stranger at the bar that all your friends have eyes on‚Ä¶

Another you entirely emerges - Tryhard You.

Tryhard You always tries very hard to come up with the perfect thing to say. That‚Äôs why you always come off very unnatural when you‚Äôre in this state. That‚Äôs why girls always seem to get bad vibes when they talk to you and excuse themselves after a couple minutes of conversation.

Tryhard You stumbles over words, and shows constant nervous beta boy body language throughout ‚Äì fidgeting, not standing up straight, leaning forward when the girl talks, holding your drink up to your face, maybe even biting your nails‚Ä¶

So the question is, why is it so easy for you to joke around with friends who know all your strengths and weaknesses...

But so hard to not come off tryhard and overthink everything when you‚Äôre in front of a random girl who doesn‚Äôt even know you?

Well, a lot of that has to do with **stress**. If you‚Äôre not used to talking to pretty girls that often, then whenever the opportunity arises, you feel as though you have to make the most of it.

Therefore, your body produces a lot of stress hormones since you‚Äôre so emotionally invested in the outcome.

Fight or flight response.

While pumping your body full of adrenaline makes a lot of sense in life or death situations when you‚Äôre running away from a hungry lion, it makes a lot less sense when you‚Äôre talking to a cute girl.

When you‚Äôre having a conversation with a girl, fight or flight does nothing but make you fidget a lot and talk super fast like a beta. It‚Äôs worse than useless. It‚Äôs downright self-sabotaging.

**Body:**

So now the question is, how do we stop trying so hard when we‚Äôre talking to cute girls and become more natural, the way we are with our friends?

First things first. You need to slow your heartrate down. When your heart is jumping a hundred times a minute, there‚Äôs not much you can do to sound more natural‚Ä¶

Box Breathing is one of the best ways to relieve stress when you‚Äôre in the field. If you ever feel too nervous, especially in the beginning of the night before you get into a good rhythm, give this a shot:

Exhale your breath to a count of 4 seconds, then hold your lungs empty for a 4 second count, then breathe in air for a 4 second count. Rinse and repeat as many times as necessary.

Once you get more advanced, you can move to more advanced forms of box breathing. The key is to get the longest exhale as possible. 4 Breaths in, hold for an 8 second count, breathe out for 16 seconds. The longer the exhale, the better it is for hacking your Vagus Nerve to reduce stress ([https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-athletes-way/201905/longer-exhalations-are-easy-way-hack-your-vagus-nerve](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-athletes-way/201905/longer-exhalations-are-easy-way-hack-your-vagus-nerve))

Ok, you feel a lot calmer?

Good. Now you can go approach that girl without immediately looking like a nervous retard. So here‚Äôs some tips on being more natural when you‚Äôre actually talking to her.

**1. Slow down while talking****.** Whenever you record yourself talking to friends or talking to cute girls, a very striking difference can be hard almost immediately.

You talk a lot faster when you‚Äôre with a cute girl! This is bad for several reasons. 

First, it gives you less time to think of what to say next.

Second, it naturally sounds beta. Think about all the great speakers you know. None of them talk super fast. It‚Äôs an inherently beta trait because it signals, *‚ÄúIBetterTalkFastBeforeTheRealAlphaGetsHere‚Äù*

Consciously work on talking slower than you normally do the next time you‚Äôre with a girl and you‚Äôll notice right away that you sound more confident and natural compared to before.

**2. Use the Lion King Technique to instantly become self-amused**. One of the biggest problems you‚Äôll have when you‚Äôre starting out is you‚Äôll try to put hot girls on pedestals, like they can do no wrong just because they have a vagina.

Obviously, you‚Äôll sound very tryhard and approval seeking until you learn how to fix this.

Here‚Äôs what you do:

I want you to imagine that you are fucking her really hard and right before you cum, you pull out and drop a huge load all over her face.

Now I want you to imagine taking your thumb and smearing the sperm across her forehead while going, ‚ÄúSiiimba!‚Äù like Rafiki from Lion King

It‚Äôs very hard to take anybody serious if you picture them with your sperm all over their face.

This is not a troll. You probably grinned like a cheeky bastard as you read about this technique. And that‚Äôs exactly the kind of look girls like. That shit eating grin that signals, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a fuck what you think I‚Äôll be having a good time regardless‚Äù 

**3. Memorize some teases you can use to make the conversation more fun**. Think about how you talk when you‚Äôre with your friends. You‚Äôre not just polite all the time. You‚Äôre constantly shitting on each other and joking around in a nonserious way. 

It just feels a lot more natural that way compared to being uptight.

The problem is, due to fight or flight response, it‚Äôs tough to come up with good teases on the spot.

Therefore, you need to take some time to come up with generic teases that put the girl in a good mood but aren‚Äôt flat out negging. 

This is different for everyone but the next time you come up with a good tease for a girl that gets a good reaction, write it down on your phone and memorize it so you don‚Äôt have to reinvent the wheel every time.

No football team comes up with new plays on the spot. They all run predetermined plays that they‚Äôve rehearsed before. It‚Äôs just a lot easier that way.

Here is my go to tease whenever I can‚Äôt come up with anything to say on the spot:

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre into (whatever she says she‚Äôs into). But something‚Äôs missing‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what it is. Maybe I‚Äôll tell you later üòä‚Äù

Does this mean you tease the girl for the entire conversation?

No. But every so often, when you sense the conversation starting to die down, throw in a tease to spice things up. The same way conversations naturally develop among your friends.

**Lessons Learned:**

When I was starting out, I hated when people told me I sounded Unnatural and Tryhard in my conversations with women without actually giving me actionable advice on how to fix it.

Unfortunately, like many things involving social interactions in the real world, girls only know and react to your ‚ÄúVibe‚Äù.

They don‚Äôt really know why some people sound natural and confident while others sound fake and tryhard. All they know is they feel uncomfortable when you do things that come across as tryhard (like talking too fast), but attracted when you sound natural.

You even see this in girls who majored in psychology. They really have no idea how to fix a guy's problems, even if they were trained to do that.

Bring one of your beta friends to a psychologist girl and ask them what they‚Äôre doing wrong.

99% of the time, the girl will simply tell your friend to ‚ÄúBe more natural‚Äù or ‚ÄúBe more confident‚Äù

And it‚Äôs utterly hilarious when you press them further, like what do you mean, be more natural? How can he do that?

And they will either freeze up and not know what to say or say some word salad new age shit that makes no sense.

When it comes to improving your vibe, ignore all general ‚Äújust be yourself‚Äù advice and search for the gold nuggets of specific actionable advice.",55,1

A critique of modern men,"At the relationship level, we are all well aware of the typical doormat husband scenario. A husband falls into complacency and the wife slowly takes power in the relationship. The wife abuses her power, but the weak husband does nothing. The wife resents him for his weakness and continues to push the limits of the relationship almost in a bid to get the husband to man up, but he never does.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what is happening at a societal level. Modern men have collectively become weak and forfeited their leadership. Women are not held accountable for their actions. They continue to push the limits of society. Modern feminism is the manifestation of that.

&amp;#x200B;

You may ask why, ""what about women? Aren't they responsible for their behavior?"" That is correct, to a degree.  To the degree that a spoiled child is responsible for their behavior. Yes, the child should be held accountable, but it is ultimately the responsibility of the parent to exhibit strong, effective leadership for the child. You can't put all of the blame on the child - they don't know better.

&amp;#x200B;

Men are at the top of the hierarchy of the family and society. They are responsible for providing strong leadership. Women can not be expected to lead themselves. For this reason, modern men have failed their women.

&amp;#x200B;

I wrote this post because it is too easy to simply put blame on the other gender. But, if we wish to improve and grow, we should be honest critics of ourselves.",99,1

The modern dating paradox after discovery of TRP,"The more I have internalized RP philosophy, the more distant I feel from genuine ""love"". I realise how a woman cannot love me the way I want to be loved  and I accept that, I move with it like an oceanic current. I'm neither here, nor there. I never come close but I'm never too far; I'm at peace with reality. 

You become realistic in your approach and attitude towards what your time, effort and overall investment in a woman can yield for you. Whether your investment portfolio is diverse or dedicated to what appears to be a safe investment. 

You see a promising low risk long term stock, that with a dedicated and high effort and capital investment will (as you may expect) yield a long term return. You play the slow game with this one, hoping the market will not fuck it, it's a special stock that nobody knows of; it's safe and secure. You're expecting that with a little bit of market observation and some input, you may keep this one content, and the rewards will follow. However, one day your stock may do a 180 backwards flip and your investment disappears like a fart in the wind. The risk you take with this sort of game is that you are too slow, too safe, you don't feel the need to monitor the market because your investment is safe and you have nothing to worry about. Now, if this was a chick, you would risk being seen as a bitch boy because you've dumped a whole load of investment into someone you think is different from the other bitches. You've taken your time, waited three dates to fuck her because you *want* something special - who doesn't? You risk being taken advantage of if you don't see how the market is performing. If the market if declining, sell that stock before you loose more than necessary. 

On the flip side, you see some high risk, high reward bitches, I mean stocks. You don't have to invest as much into them because they (as you may expect) bring high reward and require little attention. And the more investments you can inject, the higher you can gain, cumulatively. However, each stock returns less than the ""special"" stocks on an individual basis - but you have more in this scenario. Only the issue with this is that your time is dedicated to making sure all of these stocks are keeping sweet and you question is it really worth the effort. They are highly volatile, and since you stuck your dick, I mean investment, in them so early, you're really not sure how reliable the ROI is. Now if I fuck a girl on the first time meeting her, it doesn't matter how sweet she is or how well we communicate or anything, she is still a slut, high risk in terms of sticking around and expecting a good ROI. And if it was easy for me to buy, well shit, it could be easy for you too. 

Let's be real, this subreddit has been infected by basement-dwelling antisocial fanatics who have little to no experience with the reality of dating. There are some good women out there. But you must keep your guard up whichever game you play. If you want to be loved, which lets face it we all love our mothers, and we all do desire that external warmth, you must follow the rules of TRP to stay sharp and competitive in such a diverse marketplace. 

 *The paradox* If I fuck a girl on the first date (which this year has been around 8 times) I'm instantly turned off anything serious. The women know that too and it dies like Steve Irwin in a tank full of sting rays. If I take it slow, I risk someone else snatching that snatch and being left behind because I wasn't bold enough to makea move, although it would have been like shooting sting Ray's in a barrel. Ultimately, it seems that after internalizing RP principles, realising ""love"" cannot be achieved ny discussed means. Eventually, I realized that to achieve self actualization I never needed a woman, the power to have a woman as an accessory in my life is what real love is.",25,1

Lover Her; Don't Fall in Love with Her,"**TL:Dr**


Learn to love her for who she is; don't just fall in love with her.


**Body**


Once upon a time, I fell in love with a ho. The process began with a good friend of mine promising to babysit me for the night, followed by him abandoning me with these words of wisdom: *Man, this is why you need a girlfriend.*


After doing me for twenty years I caved, finding a *decent enough woman* and proceeding to fall madly in love with her. Following societies advise on love and princesses. Bending over backwards was *compromising.* We were spending way to much time together. Texting, making phone calls when we were apart. Spilling out my guts, letting her sift through the contents, having her looking at the inner parts of me I refused to admit. The woman had my heart. I handed her my mind, you know, *cause that's what a good boyfriend's suppose to do.*



Gentlemen, you've heard it before: I gave her my all, I made her my everything. Adorned her with affection, never really was one for gifts. I'd forgive and promise to forget; repaid by seeing the behavior more frequently, in more lethal dosages. This woman destroyed me emotionally, I allowed it. At societies request, restructuring my frame little by little to accommodate hers until *what* I became was unrecognizable. That's what *falling in love* does to you. I just had to try it. Everyone else was.


Fast forward a few years later. I'd found *a one.* Dope little young thing. Good with a few friends of mine. They all took a swing and missed. We hit it off. I dropped my plates. She didn't have to ask, I wanted to. Spent too much time together but that's where I wanted to spend it. This was a month in. One night she rescued my ass when the alcohol started flowing. She came out, played arm candy at the bar before taking me and my friend back to her place to sleep it off.



*I love you. Understand I'm not in love with you but love you for who you are as a human being...* according to my friend a list followed suit, including personality traits, habbits and wathcing her hobbies grow. Apparently it was something to see because they both enjoyed talking about it enough the next morning.



When she finally got me alone she laid it out. It hurt her as much as it pleased her to hear those words. She knew that I meant it, that I loved her for her attributes. She also knew I'd never *fall in love* with her. I'd never need her, she'd never be an equal or placed on a pedistule and that was more rewarding because she had earned it. She also realized if those attributes started waning or the habbits and hobbies I didn't enjoy started growing, that my love would disappear.¬†



Loving someone doesn't make them Holy, you love someone because of their holy behaviors. Creating this separation by identifying why I love a woman helps me from actually falling in love a girl. It helps stave off oneitis, knowing there are quantifiable parts of her I can find in other woman. This helps me mentally stay on my Ps and Qs while investing my energies into one. It gives me an area to focus on and reasoning for why I should or shouldn't be keeping her around.



Let's flip the script. I'm in love with my dog. Yes because he behaves well thanks to the time and effort we have put in together. He end up with my mom for six months, he was injured while traveling and couldn't continue on. When we were finally reunited he was overweight, begged and tugged on his leash. Now best believe if any of *the ones* I decide to invest in starts drinking heavy or getting bitchy, it's over. My dog, well we'll work on that.


Same instance with my brother. We were never close. Lived different lifestyles and while we do share similar hobbies we've never really kick it. We're not the type of person the other spends his time with. Still I'm in love with him. He's family. He needs me, I got him; I need him, he's got me. Couldn't even tell you the type of music he likes but that's my boy.¬†



What I mean by *a one* is basically a rip off of *the one* with the stipulation written in that there is multiple dream girls out there for you. While spinning plates occasionally I meet *one of the ones.*¬†



Now I've watched plenty of people do crazy shit for drugs. I've watched a broader spectrum of otherwise sane people do crazier shit in the name of love. Herion, herione; there's a reason they're prounced the same. Avoid falling in love all together. Spin plates and never build a connection. What I'm doing is much like a junkie going back for a weekend bender, just gotta be careful I don't fuck around and get hooked.


To help starve addiction while investing time in *one of the ones,* ask yourself why you enjoy her so much. Identfiying these¬† traits will make it easier to not only know when to cut her loose but it'll make it easier to let her go in the process. Again because you enjoy her for her qualities, qualities other woman posses.



*Decent enough womam* with okay looks and okay personality get spun as plates, not dated. Pretty woman with poor personality get fucked not dated. Even pretty woman with an okay personality get spun, all be it a little harder, not dated.¬†Identifying what I like in an individual woman helped isolate patterns within partner selection, helping to highlight qualities I have to have, enjoy having and will not tolerate. Once I started developing *my taste* for woman, my standards and the enjoyment I got out of girls sky rocketed.



**In Conclusion:**


*A man in love* says, ""baby I'll never leave you, no matter what."" He means it too. *A man who knows why he loves* his woman also knows why he'll leave her. If you're looking for an LTR situation you need to know why and what qualities you're looking for in a partner. Identfiying these reasons helps build taste increasing standards by drawing boundaries on what you want and what you will not put up.",85,1
FOR MEN: Don‚Äôt have kids until your 40,"**Intro**

The last few years I have been struggling with the idea about having kids. 

When is the best time? - When I was 19 I made a conscious decision to not have kids until 35.

Can I find a somewhat decent woman to raise kids with in 2020?

For reference I am in my early 30s. 

Most of my life progression has been driven by the fact that I want kids and a family. I need to be able to support my family like my dad did for me and my sibling's and my mother even while making under fix figures and being ass raped by child support for 18 years (Even though he went above and beyond for my step sister)

So I had an epiphany the other day locked in my digital WFH prison we are all becoming accustomed to. 

Men should not have kids until 40. Men if they are to consider getting married should not do so until the bare minimum of 40. - I would stick to TRP and never get married. Arguably the older and more successful you are the more you have to lose but at any stage of the game you have the most to lose when it comes to divorce.

 The woman MUST be from 19 - 23ish max age.


**Men need time to grow**

As we all know here on TRP becoming a man is a long fucking process. It takes trial , error, blood, sweat, tears and hopefully a decent father figure or masculine presence to help us along the way in our developing years.
When men finally enter their 20s most of this time should be spent learning a skill and beginning the journey of mastering a craft. The purpose most men search for should be found at 18-20. The next decade of your life should be spent mastering whatever this skill/craft is. 

When in your 30s you should be where you start making good money and/or have decided to start your own business because a 9-5 is to self-limiting for you.

During your 20s-30s in terms of women you should be chasing tail and getting laid without commitment. Any kind of commitment at this time will take you away from being better and mastering whatever it is you choose to do. Women waste your time. This is a fact. Don‚Äôt let women suck your time away. Just let them suck your dick. Just the tip is all that is needed haha.

During this time also you will be learning a lot about yourself, learning from your failures, lifting heavy weights, and also maybe starting a cool hobby. Party/travel occasionally to have some fun, blow off steam and get laid. 85% of the time you should be learning, applying what you learned, lifting, eating right and basically busting your ass.

**So why 40?**

When you hit 40 you should be pretty established at this point in your life. Good job making six figures. Own a business making 6,7,or 8 Figures. By this time you should have fucked a good amount of women. Sprinkle in some hired guns also just because fuck it why not. (Nothing like banging a hired gun, kicking her out, and just relax and play video games after haha.)

 At 40 you should know yourself well, have a foothold in the game, financially independent, and hopefully free of debt and also fit. Your also at a stage in life that you can effectively teach others because you have enough experience in life and whatever it is you do. 

If you had kids at 40 by the time you are 60 your kids will be at least 20. Old enough to potentially be on their own still young enough to be dependent on you but not fully dependent. Also if your relationship goes south around this time who gives a fuck? As long as you got her to be a good mother to your children that‚Äôs all that matters. 


**Why must she be 19-23?**

I have dated and fucked girls that were 19, 23, 25, 32, 40, 45. There was something to be learned from some of these chicks that I dated for a while. One thing that was obvious to me was that the younger a girl is especially 19-23 the more obedient she is. The more submissive she is. She is also still trying to figure herself out. This is the peak time to get a girl caught deep into your seduction methods. They are the best fucks and they listen to you.(as long as you play your part right) They are also the most fertile. - There is something to be said about this because I notice I get extra horny fucking girls who are 19 - 21. Pussy is ripe!

Women IMO subtlety change around 25. They get a little more bitchy. A little more annoying. Can be slightly more combative. Just a little. 

When a girl enters the post wall stage of early 30s and above is when all this shit starts to sky rocket. Obviously their fertility is declining but every girl I dated in her 30s or 40s after a year would get unbearably bitchy at times, annoyingly combative, basically they just start becoming less feminine. I blame a lot of this on modern day society and feminism but part of it does come with age. It's pretty consistent in every woman I have dated in this age range.

They like being told what to do but they also don‚Äôt like being told what to do. (If you dated women in this age range you know what I'm talking about) 

If you can game a girl while she is 19-23 and get her to fall for you deeply and have kids with her there is a good chance she will be a good mother if you play your alpha cards right and you didn‚Äôt stick your dick in crazy. She cant be as occupied with bullshit like most American women like partying and drinking because shes taking care of the kids and being a mother. If your money is right she can even be a stay at home mom and make you dinner at night. You're older than her so she will also somewhat see you as a father figure. Every way you look at it when you are at least 40 and dating a girl in her early 20s it seems to work out better for both parties. Back in the day it seemed like a 10 - 15 year age difference was really common in a lot of peoples families but society has shamed older men from dating younger women. Don‚Äôt fall for that shit.

I am sure many people on here will disagree with me. Explain yourself if you do. I know a lot of guys rather just play it easy and never have kids and never get married and that‚Äôs cool I have flirted a lot with that also but the kids part of it I think is where a lot of guys including myself struggle because most of us want to procreate. Chasing tail for a long time can become purposeless after a while. Getting into LTRs once in a while is a good way to stop this but at some point that gets pretty stale also. Why not use these bitches what they were made for and what we were made to do?",75,1

How to keep frame when talking to boss?,"I work as a software engineer. The boss I‚Äôm dealing with is CTO. He has manipulative traits. Sometimes he uses it to make people work long hours for free. Realizing this, I‚Äôve tried not letting myself be manipulated when discussing work with him. If discussion topics relates to my well-versed technologies, I have no problem with keeping my frame and he cannot force more work on me. However, in recent performance reviews, I notice this pattern: he sometimes asks very difficult questions that maybe only senior members can answer. He knows that by asking these, he can easily throw me off my feet (it looks like he knows my Achilles heel). And he‚Äôs quite right. It‚Äôs like being ambushed, I start stuttering and hardly regain my frame.

You might know that IT industry is a very vast and ever changing field. I‚Äôm very knowledgeable in some technologies but I know very little about other ones. There‚Äôs no way I can know everything.

Question: how do you deal with surprised scenarios, in which the other person makes use of his/her superior knowledge to steal your frame?",33,1

I mean thought precedes action, so what will make you different from sheeple normie NPCs is that you will think things they do not, and DO things they do not. The answer I found to this question is that these guys are not truly redpilled, and will do what the alpha male of the group tells them to while thinking ""heh, you think you're winning but in reality i'm following law 38 i'm an ALPHA MAIL!!!!1"" as a gigantic cope mechanism.

Competitive Ball Fondling and You: Entrepreneurship Intro For the Newbies,"**Hello!**

Today‚Äôs Post is impromptu but based off a topic from the previous post, **‚Äú102 Basics: How To Punch Fucking Sharks (Mental Game Prime)‚Äù** since a few gentlemen in the comments had questions about a suggestion I made about **Hobbies** (Gymming and Reading don‚Äôt count, everyone should be doing this anyway), Finding your **Passion**, and the Pursuit of **Entrepreneurship**. This also fell directly in line with **‚Äú101 Basics: Shut the Fuck Up‚Äù** where more voices clamored for financial and career advice (*which I am totally un-fucking-qualified to give, by the way).*

Usual disclaimer, please feel free to blast my ass in the comment section if you think I am full of shit (Make no mistake, *I completely am*) or upvote if you agree, all advice is only worth what you pay for it (shit nothing, in this case). This time, the information was posted in the comments of 102 Basics. **Remember: Not everything is applicable to everyone.** If this is your bag, Alright. If you couldn‚Äôt care less, disregard‚Ä¶ Aight.

# ‚ÄúCompetitive Ball Fondling and You: Entrepreneurship Edition‚Äù

Not everything works for everyone, and I cannot in good conscience recommend any ‚Äòone‚Äô thing to do for a business because there is an entire world of topics and ideas, just on Reddit alone, where people discuss business ideas, startups, etc. They have their own cultures and in-jokes and phrases, they have their own general knowledge bases and sidebars (which, reminder, you should read ours), book recommendations, etc. I‚Äôll point out that, just like TRP, successful people normally aren‚Äôt just sitting on their ass on Reddit all day long, they‚Äôre out living their best life doing rails of coke off their secretary‚Äôs fake tits and don‚Äôt need this shit; and if you do pursue Entrepreneurship and Small Business Ownership full time it‚Äôs an incredibly lonely path and may not be for everyone. Also be extremely wary of 99% of posts and content, as many people have left those areas who actually gave good advice (for various reasons) and it‚Äôs been infested with snake oil salesmen. Sound Familiar? They have the same kind of problem we do, but more pronounced. Plus, Entrepreneurship is inherently competitive; ‚Äòif you have a literal million dollar idea why would you be openly discussing your secret golden goose to mouth-breathing troglodytes on reddit? For FREE?

**Yeah, Not Happening.** My goal is to help people ***eat***.

This is why you have to be careful, most people have a snake oil salesmen business where they sell their **bullshit** to good, honest people like **You and Me** who want ‚Äòin‚Äô but don‚Äôt know shit. **Accountability Statement: I have lost several thousands of dollars on their bullshit, and the best information was for free if I had just fucking read more, and watched more Youtube. I am a dumbfuck. Do not make my same mistakes. Do Better.** They effectively sell counterfeits via marketing programs, courses, coaching, and lots of ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô preaching. *They‚Äôre selling you ice water in winter from your own damn spigot.*. On the flip, I am a huge fan of Youtube Channels like **Entrepreneurs in Cars** or **Valuetainment** from **Patrick Bet-David.** These are completely free resources that are worth their weight in **absolute gold** to name just two.

*Ahem*. **Anyways**.

Here‚Äôs some shit I picked up after a few years and it‚Äôs a super condensed version of ‚Äòmeta‚Äô strategies that I feel ‚Äúmost‚Äù people would endorse. Honestly, I just wish someone had put me on the game ahead of time. *Take the following advice with a grain of salt, I don‚Äôt know shit from fuck, gawddamn.*

1). You‚Äôre likely going to fail your first few businesses. Accept this as the price to ride. Reference **102 Basics: Punch Fucking Sharks** if you need a refresher on how to be prepared for this, or *read the fucking sidebar.*

2). If you‚Äôre serious, there‚Äôs a **2-3 year typical period** where you have to bust ass before your business becomes truly self-sustainable and you can ‚Äòchill out‚Äô and reap the benefits. **Some people go right into it with loans, others work a dayjob and then a side job until they can quit their main**. *I =personally= recommend you keeping your dayjob til your business is stable and makes equal or greater the amount of income as your day job, so you can have as smooth a transition as possible.* Some people may want to have both a main job and hustle indefinitely and that works too. It will still be hard, but you‚Äôre not donating plasma to put gas in your car to make ‚Äújust‚Ä¶one‚Ä¶more‚Ä¶ sale‚Äù. You will go through **multiple iterations and revisions** before you hit a particular combination of things that ‚Äòclick‚Äô. You‚Äôll upgrade from Ramen to McDonalds, at least. This is **exponentially** harder if you have dependents (wife/kids/elderly) so if you‚Äôre about it, do this shit **sooner than later.** Anyone who tells you otherwise is likely A) an **extreme exception** to the rule or is B) fucking lying to you and **ABSOLUTELY** should not be trusted. **This isn‚Äôt a straight path, and it is not easy, and it is not quick.**

3). People around you are **fake as fuck hypocrites** and will likely screw you and won‚Äôt believe in your **Vision** because they cannot see it. Thus, **move in silence**, and keep everything to yourself. Reference **101 Basics, Shut the Fuck Up** and its comments.

4). This also means be **careful** who you get advice from, because they can lead you astray, with the best intentions, even me, your ol‚Äôsmarmy bastard Uncle Crisis. Everyone is fallible. Have a clear vision, mission statement, whatever, and **make sure ALL your decisions are in line with Advancing. That. Singular. Goal.** ***‚ÄúWhat do I want to achieve with entrepreneurship? What am I willing to sacrifice?‚Äù*** **Write it down. Post it somewhere obvious.** This way, you have a signpost to help remind you of what is *most important*, and why you‚Äôre even doing this stupid piddly shit. If you face a difficult decision, you can **assess the pros and cons against your core mission statement.** Do It Now. Or not. I‚Äôm not your Mom. **If you don't have a clear vision, why are you even wasting your time pursuing this? Go be a wage cuck.**

5). Focus on either something you know extremely well‚Ä¶hmmm, let‚Äôs say‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre an expert in **Competitive Ball Fondling**; you know the **demographic**, what **appeals** to them, **where** they **congregate**, what their **tastes** (balls, obviously) are already. **Become high visibility active contributor** in those communities and **ORGANICALLY begin** ***portraying yourself as an expert*** and begin to slowly and **quietly build your product** to other ball fondlers based on their **feedback, wants, and needs.** **Write more posts** about fondling balls, **interact on other people‚Äôs posts** when they talking about fondling balls, **make some short videos** where you fondle balls, **engage with people naturally**; create a professional persona that you are a **TRUSTED AUTHORITY** on any and all ball fondling related activities and *then, and only then,* begin selling a product to the **audience** you built over time. That‚Äôs when you sell them A **SOLUTION TO THEIR PROBLEM THAT ONLY YOU CAN PROVIDE.**

6). If you‚Äôre unsure what to do, don‚Äôt do a ‚Äòpassion project‚Äô business (because you really love fucking competitive ball fondling, don‚Äôt you?) that you probably don‚Äôt know shit about but you think sounds cool and is easy, (Cough ^(Dropshipping) Cough ^(nobody wants to wear your shitty made up brands) Cough ) but start with a simple **‚Äòcash flow positive business‚Äô** that can generate revenue quickly and get money back into your pipeline. **It‚Äôs not going to be glamorous,** but small businesses like house cleaning, owning a laundromat, snow shoveling, pressure washing company, lawn mowing company, moving company, painting company, seasonal holiday related company like gift wrapping, low-end electronics repair company like laptop or cellphone, etc., have a relatively low barrier to entry (usually just materials), you don‚Äôt need anything but some Udemy and Youtube courses, don‚Äôt usually need a license under a certain volume (you -may- want to consider this website Rocket Lawyer or similar where you can download premade contract templates with **airtight legalese to waive liability if/when anything goes wrong.** You may also want to **consider getting an insurance policy and/or LLC** so they can‚Äôt sue your ball fondling happy ass directly, best be super careful here and **do your own research and be thorough** and even talk to someone who‚Äôs doing it/has done it already), and some basic 101 marketing, sales, and organizational courses. Don‚Äôt get fucked by taxes, stash 1/3 of income in a separate account for taxes (I‚Äôm an AmeriFat and that‚Äôs our tax code for most places, mileage may vary). Start with something you could do out your garage, or something that doesn‚Äôt require more than a 15 year old used pickup truck or standard white p\*\*\* van. **Remember that your business doesn't have to do anything new or unique, and that the vast majority of businesses are doing the exact same shit.**

7). Don‚Äôt forget, **you have the ability to determine what factors are least- or most- important for you.** If you want to be location independent, focus an online home-based business. If you want something that you need available 24/7 but need to sleep or shit, even occasionally; research businesses or strategies that fit that need. Example, you may want to run a business that requires appointments, you can have someone on **Fiverr** or whatever other programs/websites out there that **hire part time people** you can train to answer your phone calls for you like a personal assistant and say a script you write and have them simply email you the details for a follow up next business day or **filter for emergencies directly to your phone**. Now, you have a 24/7 business and you **hedged the cost by outsourcing** to an online call center for cheap that works **per call instead of hourly**. (You‚Äôre fucking welcome you **filthy animals**, this is a **huge deal** for many of people who haven‚Äôt heard of this type of service before. Blew my own fucking mind first time I heard about it).

**8). Document everything. Scale what you can, when you can. Be as specific as possible about your process, so that literally anyone who comes behind you could follow your directions. This will save your ass down the line. Trust Me.**

9). Have good customer service pipeline, make payments easy, don‚Äôt **EVER** accept jobs (or fondle balls) you cannot handle because **they are too big/complex/time consuming**, do not make exceptions for requests (**exceptions strangle businesses**) and **keep shit as simple as possible**, don‚Äôt work unless you‚Äôre paid up front or at least take a deposit. **Accurately scoping jobs** is a lesson you should only fuck up once or twice before it becomes so painful you likely will **sink the entire business operation or Do Better.**

**10). ???**

**11). Profit!**

12). Once you‚Äôre profitable, **find and train bodies** to do the grunt work for you at a similar level of competency so you can **devote your energy to expansion (Scaling), Sales/Marketing and Optimization/Efficiency**. Your underlings (once you have them) should be **about 70% of the competency level that you provide when doing the same task.** Too competent and *you just trained your future competition*, too inept and *you‚Äôre wasting your time and your client‚Äôs time, which hurts your brand and reputation.* You‚Äôd be better off hiring monkeys because at *least* you don‚Äôt have to pay them to shit on everyone, **they‚Äôll do it for free.**

13). **Decide if you want to continue expanding and double down, delegate out your tasks to get more free time, sell and cash out entirely, or open another business.** My =personal opinion= is you should have a couple cashflow positive businesses that are at a stable point where they can run themselves with minimal attention from you (hence why your process has to be so specific) and you start generating that sweet ass **‚Äúmultiple income streams‚Äù** everyone loves to circle jerk about. Then once you have a few that are profitable for awhile, you can start looking at bigger or riskier investments so that you have flexibility. **You‚Äôll be more experienced, make less mistakes, and won‚Äôt be as cash strapped because even if one fails, you‚Äôll have others to pick up the slack** and unless you have a string of catastrophic events hit, you‚Äôll still be financially stable. Then you‚Äôll have **fiscal resilience** and can waste your money on your true passion, **Competitive Ball Fondling** business all you want instead of your 3rd lawn care company and not risk losing the shirt off your back. Or you could invest in other endeavors, such as real estate or stocks. There‚Äôs an added bonus of where you become **OUTCOME INDEPENDENT** (102 Primer) because you know you have the income already coming coupled with the **confidence of knowing you're capable of success** so you can **make better decisions since your risk factors are minimized and act with greater clarity.** You could also just, IDK, reinvest all that newfound wealth back into the business to grow it. I honestly couldn‚Äôt care less.

14). This shit is a **Skill** just like everything else that must be honed and sharpened, and you are most definitely **Competing**. Your competition may not be directly in front of you, but rest assured they are out there plotting, scheming, and **orchestrating your downfall** so they can take what you have rightfully earned for yourself. You always need to be reading books, networking, and researching new strategies to **stay ahead of the curve as far as the horizon**. **Play Chess while Everyone Else is playing Checkers.** (Next week‚Äôs ""103 Primer Topic, A teaser!"")

15). At this point, your only problem is making sure you don‚Äôt let the newfound wealth get to your head since if you're listening to literally anything I'm saying you're probably broke and not used to having to manage large sums of money (Chicken Flavored Ramen to McDonalds Tendies is a pretty big *fucking* deal when you‚Äôre a broke mf like I was at one point, now imagine going from Crispy Tendies to Brazilian Steakhouses) and you forget the basics and start **Buying Stupid Shit You Don‚Äôt Need, Go Into Needless Debt, and Forget Your Fundamentals that got you to this point in the first place.**

**Congrats!** I could have charged you **18 small installments of** ***only*** **$499 (+ tax and international shipping rates x surge fare)** for this information if you only subscribed to my **Elite ‚Äúmembers only‚Äù ultra-first-class-top-gun-promo-millionaire‚Äôs-captain‚Äôs-table network‚Ñ¢** (which is **TOTALLY** not a pyramid scheme and may-or-may-not include complimentary blowjobs from horny co-ed teens in your area) but you‚Äôre now **better equipped** than *bare minimum* 70% of gullible **FUCKs** on boomer ‚Äòwealth building‚Äô teams or whatever the fuck else ‚Äògurus‚Äô like **Tai Lopez** shove down people‚Äôs throats. I won‚Äôt even lie to you, that shit actually pisses me off. Their businesses are all selling other people shit strats, outdated tactics and wealth virtue signaling; **No Substance, Low Value, Vapid Bullshit.**

**That ain‚Äôt why we here, or why the FUCK we do this.Class is over.Get the fuck out of my face.**

So this is a thing?,"About 30 years ago I started noticing the hypocrisy of feminism and that realization slowly evolved into a full on censure of the Left and a deeper understanding of female nature. For many years I was mocked and scorned from all sides, both men and women, but now I'm pleased that many are waking up to the radically altered female persona.

As a old geezer and long out of the market I may not recognize contemporary dynamics but there are some things that generally hold true.

Women's ""truth"" is an expression of her immediate emotional state, in fact I've a whole bit on the difference between ""egg truth"" and ""sperm truth"" (internal vs transcendent). You still need to take her seriously, though not necessarily her meaning.

Women live in their own imagination and the better you can access that the more she's going to appreciate you. There are numerous stereotypes and metaphors that can be employed, but relating to her personal symbols is the best.

A woman's persona changes when she moves from the public to the private (a safe space). She's going to tend to be proper and rule abiding in public but I've yet to meet a woman who isn't a criminal in her own safe space. And by ""criminal"" I mean anarchist ... it's whatever you feel like.

One of the biggest problems men have regarding women is that we tend to want to imagine them to be just like ourselves with ourselves defined as good. The different strategies of women aren't necessarily bad but reflect the primary quality of insecurity shared almost universally by women.

For example: While it's true that women are at least as likely as men to initiate domestic violence such behavior is far more damaging to the woman, they are weaker and more vulnerable.

This is, of course, the tiniest thumbnail ... there's so much more.",45,1
Life on TRT - the best way to train.,"Hello guys, few days ago I 've written a post that for some people there is an advantage in TRT.

I want to show you how easy you can lift on TRT, have a great body and have almost zero side effects from the gym. No muscle soreness, pain in your joints, no risk and, of course, only 60kg for a bench press!

So here is how I look like

[https://imgur.com/oDFNM5k](https://imgur.com/oDFNM5k)

&amp;#x200B;

I know, you will tell me, that looks absolutely like a natural guy who trains hard. And I like that! I am not a mass monster, just an athletic body. Why not ? I just do not train hard. I train easy.

Now - everyone will tell me this is not serious. It is a joke. But please take a look. 60kg x 110 reps.

[https://imgur.com/MjPm5Ba](https://imgur.com/MjPm5Ba)

&amp;#x200B;

Every day. Easy, never pushing to the limits, never muscle soreness, never getting any stress. Btw, after 1 minute I'm completely fresh and can repeat, well, not 110 but 80 times. In 2 mins I can do 110 reps again!

&amp;#x200B;

On TRT you can train how the fuck you want and get a reasonable body. Or you can train well and get an awesome body. But why bother - if you are not in competitions, just enjoy your life! Talk to people, look at nice asses, talk with girls, stare at boobs, listen to your music. And then 60 sets, 20 reps with 60kg bench press during one hour as an easy walk.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, that is if you NEED trt. I am against any steroid cycles. I believe you should always have your testosterone around 1200-1500 ng/dL.",44,1

Is ruskie anon right?,"But really, what can you do to stop sexual harassment besides extreme laws?

&gt;can you do to stop sexual harassment besides extreme laws
Women. It's all up to women.

You see, sexual harassment(or put it that way: ""sexual harassment"") lives on because... because why? Why dirty men continue to behave dirty? Answer might surprise you: because women LOVE it!

Yep, that's simple.

Sexual harrasment lives because it WORKS.

Sexual 'harassment' works cuz it get's girls.
Being 'nice and good' doesn't work because it doesnt bring you the girl.

If suddenly all girls would REJECT the never-ending whistles, looks, DMs and approached of jerks and started to choose nice, calm guys, who never say a dirty vulgar word or give a dirty vulgar look - then the pigs would see that their behavior(grab her by the pussy) fails and girls are not turning on by that.

but - the reality is that being nice, good, modest IS NOT rewarded!

You can say now 'but it SHOULD NOT be rewarded, just be good man and live a good life' and i mostly agree with you, that waiting a reward for simply not being a bad guy is selfish and arrogant, but we live as a biological creatures and the POINT of our leaving is to find a mate(girl) and make a babies(thus have immportality and pass our genes, vocies, faces, hair, educatons, values and knowledge to the future generations).
and you see what? Being jerk have a 10-20-30-50% chance reward, while being nice guys is 0% reward.

Fucking pigs have more success with women that a good-nice guys, because being good is not rewarded, while be being insisting and vulgar gives you a chance, beacuse eventually some girl will reward such behaviors, while she will never say ""oh, you are so nice and kind, and never vulgar, never even look lustful or innappropriate at my perfect fit ass in tights, lets go to dinner together and maybe eventually we'll become husband and wife and have a kids together"". No one.


it's women who reward bad behavior. It's the WOMEN'S CHOICES(not men's!) which regulate mating behaviors

That's my theory.",12,1
American Masculinity,"I often get criticized for being too ""blackpilled"" and for hating on Jordan Peterson a bit too much. Sorry but I simply can't help but laugh at his new book announcement. A teary eyed boomer formerly addicted to opioids announcing ""12 new rules of life"" for the normies in the Anglosphere. 

The thing is Jordan Peterson perfectly represents the limbo in which the anglosphere is stuck in. As democracies become more draconian and private companies own our lives thanks to the ""free market"" the eternal anglo keeps burying his head inside his Adam Smith books finding ways to cope as his ideologies crumble

America is unique in this aspect, its inception paved the way for the downfall of the aristocracy and the monarchy and concepts like egalitarianism and freedom took its place. How can an american be antifeminist and yet be an egalitarian? How can an american scoff at transgenders and yet claim to love freedom?

Because of this, a way back to traditional masculinity is impossible for Americans. 
They can't rebel because that would mean questioning the very foundations of their being. 

WW1 and WW2 was the triumph of American ideology over the old world. Concepts that should've died like democracy, egalitarianism, and globalism became the norm, thus sealing the fate of concepts like patriarchy, honor, and nobility.

Due to the triumph of global capital, life became much easier in the 50s and 60s and capitalism was seen as an american conservative force against communism. 

In reality capitalism is liberal, it is disloyal, and profited immensely from trading with the USSR. The 1970s were the beginning of the outsourcing of jobs. Young women and immigrants were receiving a big push in order cut labor costs. When a man is defined by his economic status and the ability to take care of his family but the tools they need to do this are eroded you are then left with the great cubicle nihilism of the 90s. 

At the end of the 20th century the beloved Tyler Durden became a symbol of anti capitalism, anti consumerism. The problem is that despite rebelling against everything american zombies stand for, he still got caught up in a spiral of self destruction. 

There was no clear path for Tyler Durden left, no way forward and no way backward, destruction was all that was left. Tyler Durden was still trapped in this dialectical materialist mindset without ever reaching higher forms of thinking.¬† 

Americans are still stuck in this dialectic 20 years later after the first Tyler Durden appeared. Instead of embracing globohomo they buy Petersons new book to cope. Instead of promoting feminism they prefer to worship the sacred GDP. This is because its impossible for them to think outside of the masonic ideals the founding fathers bestowed upon them. 

Those who believe masculinity could be restored under some superficial banner like Trumpism or Zoomer Conservatism fail to understand that American men are missing one key component: Americans have never lost a war on their soil and therefore have never truly questioned their ideology.

Americans as a collective have never been through the same sufferings, the same foreign occupation, the same humiliation as other countries have, thus preventing them from analyzing their failures and building a family unit capable of fighting back.

They fail to understand the true meaning of identity, devotion, sacrifice and leadership. The fact that a bourgeoisie like Donald Trump is seen as the great savior of the working class proves that Americans have no idea what a real leader looks like. Their concept of freedom and individualism prevents them submitting to a real leader and from giving birth to a new aristocracy capable of leading the masses. 

As unfortunate as it is America will always have freedom, self enrichment and individualism as its core values, paving the way for the desecration of the patriarchy and ultimately leading to the great [Boomer Suicide]

Conclusion

Right now The American Regime is no longer operating on good will but on zealotry, liberalism has become their religion. It doesn't matter how much money they print or how many soldiers they sacrifice as long as your daughter becomes a slut and your son a transgender.

Therefore breaking away from the anglosphere both mentally and physically is an absolute necessity in order to restore your masculinity. Otherwise your concept of masculinity will end up becoming deformed by the inevitable [degeneracy]

Too much red pill?,"When does it end? I feel like this whole persona takes you down a rabbit hole of nihilism.  I‚Äôm tall wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm ugly nor like the most handsome person ever, I can get in amazing shape (I did in 2016 and 2018 but it‚Äôs hard to get back to where I was with the corporate sedentary lifestyle).  10-12% body fat, don‚Äôt have an issue with women, however I feel like my mentality towards them has become so toxic where I feel like they‚Äôre useless other than sex.  My motivation has been nonexistent these past few months with random spurts of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna make it‚Äù that don‚Äôt usually last longer than like a week.

I see a few possible issues would like to see what you guys think.  I‚Äôm abstinent for religious reasons although I‚Äôve had girls on the bed w me sexy as fuck naked begging to smash.  Up until 24 my main motivation was being successful financially and being with a girl that I ‚Äúloved‚Äù.  Is love even real dude? I think I fucked up by doing shit with girls, I made a decision at 24 to go all the way except for sex with a girl mainly because  I think marriage is a scam and I‚Äôll be a virgin for life lmfao.

Anyways, I also hate my fucking corporate job and I feel like I‚Äôm addicted to jerking off.  The issue is if I don‚Äôt jerk off I get so sex crazed and spend all my free time talking to girls.  I can‚Äôt find a balance.

My thoughts have gotten me to a rabbit hole where like before I‚Äôd see a girl and get motivated and now after messing around with a few girls I just don‚Äôt even care about it anymore.  I‚Äôm sure this is just my day 2 no fap talking and it‚Äôll be restored in like 5 days but I just have no interest in anything anymore.  Is it my soul draining job?  Is it not having sex? Is it my ‚Äúmentality‚Äù that I need to change? 

By the way I make like 90k at my job and I decided to quit and do an accelerated nursing program so I work part time making half the money now living cash flow negative.  I do have savings but that also might be a part of my lack of motivation?  Idk I‚Äôll be able to make overtime as a nurse and work with all bitches and at least help people rather than slaving on excel all day..


What do you guys think? I feel like as red pill as you want to be life is meaningless unless you can build a solid connection with not just your boys but you need a fucking girl... but I just feel like all girls are sloots.. idk where I‚Äôm going with this but someone talk to me tell me what you think.",24,1

Young Man Field Report-Happy Relationship,"I want to share my experiences dating here. I wasn't ever looking for the red pill, I found it on my own and it's led to great things.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Have obtained the perfect ""red pill"" relationship, the key I've found is to learn how to accept your dominance.

To start- I'd probably consider myself a 7 or 8 so it's not like I was in need of help pulling chicks. I am not particularly strong now but was very skinny back then-but damn did I have confidence. That was the first lesson I learned after being a bit of a dweeb early high school: fake it till you make it. Everyone else out there is also scared shitless and doesn't know what they're doing. You immediately stand out if you simply act confidently, speak up, and the most importantly I think: you need to not be afraid to be genuine. 

When I say be genuine, I am reflecting on the fact that a lot of my male friends, or at least the ""alpha"" types, really aren't afraid to show their genuine emotions. Not anger; but comradery, appreciation, joy. Nothing gets people to like you better than if they think you truly enjoy their company. Weaker men seem to hide their feelings and come off wimpy, even bitchy. 

My second lesson came in college. I was dating this girl with an enormous type-A ""girl power"" personality. I was infatuated with her, thought she was more intelligent than me and would be far greater than me at everything and I really didn't mind that. Looking back, I was totally her bitch, but I didn't care; I thought she was great. 

In our relationship though there were a few moments where I made her submit to me, and they were truly amazing. It felt like I had awoken a different person inside of her. The first time I bent her over during sex she orgasmed harder than ever. She was also a chick who would say she never wanted to have children, and soon enough she started talking about baby names and all kinds of shit that really just showed be that her instinctive womanhood was starting to take over. Unfortunately, about a year in, I think she realized she was no longer this feminist icon who stood up to the patriarchy, had a huge identity crisis, and dumped me. It actually happened within a week of me getting an internship that she had been denied from, and that was on top of a number of things I started to suddenly be better than her at. In all, her blue pill reawoke, she realized she was not independent or the ""alpha"" of our relationship, and she bailed. Terrible break up haven't spoken since, but I find great comfort in knowing what I dodged. And even better, five years later now, her boyfriend is perhaps the most beta male I've ever seen. Very grateful that isn't me.

I was hurt, but then came the lesson : It either makes you bitter or it makes you better. I honestly owe so much success to that break up. I worked on myself hard, had a string of good, less intense relationships, and am pretty successful as a young man right now. I have never considered myself to be a player or anything, but I definitely got around and pulled some girls out of my range. The biggest thing I disagree with this board on is the significance of one night stands, fucking girls and not caring about them. I don't think that's healthy. I take pride in the fact that of the girls I've slept with, hardly any are one night stands, and nearly all of them I have a good relationship with, though we rarely will talk. Sex can and should be mutual at this stage of life. Young men and women are having a good time, exploring their bodies, finding pleasure, and it isn't necessarily evil. I do, however, think that I would have a much harder time accepting a woman that has slept around if I had not had the opportunity to do so a bit myself, though I do only mean in the realm of 10-20 partners. 

Finally, I started dating a girl a year ago and we are going strong. I wasn't really looking for a red-pilled woman, but damn am I lucky I found one. On her first date she told me how much she hates modern feminism, how the sexes are different, and how we're better at certain things than the other. Most importantly, she fully embraces this idea of dominance and submission. I have never had a relationship like this fellas, I tell you I feel completely in control. It was hard to get used to. It felt awkward to be ""the man"" in the relationship, since I am still pretty young (23). At first I felt like a bit of a poser, but I learned to grow into it. And let me tell you, it was the best and more significant change of my life. Accept your dominance. Wear is proudly. Not just with your partner, but with with the rest of the world too. 

These days, I am not worried about her being with another man at all. Never. I am not worried that I don't satisfy her, I am not worried that she will leave me, it simply doesn't feel possible. She looks at me with so much joy. She openly will tell me that she submits to me, especially during sex, and honestly I just feel like a fucking king with her. She makes me feel strong, smart, sexy, and most of all, like I produce for her. And in return I make her feel safe, adored, and respected. This relationship honestly could not be better and it truly feels like how every relationship should. So my last lesson was to learn to accept dominance, to exercise it, and also appreciate it and not take it for granted. The greatest gift a woman can give you is her submission. You've got to earn it. I did. 

It's a damn shame to see how many young men are not acting like men these days. Everyone seems to wants to be the victim, everyone wants to be the one taken care of, everyone wants to be submissive. It's a shame. I am fortunate to have found a woman who pushed me into the dominant role, and I feel better about myself than ever before.",45,1

Think for Yourself,"**Tl:Dr**

Succes is an individual journey, unique to each man.

**Body**

Recently while speaking with my younger brother about self improvement, he questioned why I'd be listening to men talk about how they overcame their trials and tribulations. Simply put, while my road to the top is my own, there are plenty of great guides that are willing to lay out what they had to do to get to where they are today. However, following their word to the T won't guarantee the same success. Pleanty of reasons explain this; the timing is off, the markets saturated, technology has changed, society is different but mainly it comes down to the fact that I'm different.


I'm not them, you're not them, you're not me or any other knuckle head that drags his fist across the keyboard to type out a post. That being said there are aspects that almost every successful person have in common. There are pleanty of universally agreeded upon habits that'll help get you to where you'd like to go. The execution is what's argued upon. The ability to not only learn from others who've gone before but to add and build your own personalized addition to their foundation is key.


Start thinking of these self help guides as recipes that are modified over time, adding and subtracting minior parts until you have your own, working, unique flavor. Understanding that you won't know what's best right away but after putting time and effort into an area of improvement, you'll gain a wider set of knowledge, allowing you to make your own judgment calls. You don't always want to have to check in with the experts for everything. Dr. Whoever says you gotta get your exercise in first thing in the morning because X, Y and Z and maybe you can only make it to the gym at night. Maybe callistetics are more your thing than lifting weights. For this reason fitness is the easiest example to explain.


Fuck if I knew what to do. Popped on here, found Starting Strength and punched my information into a Calories Calculator and off we went. Good place to start as my knowledge of weight training, kinesiology and nutrition was zero. The information I was obtaining was coming from good, tried and tested sources. All I had to do was stick to the plan. That worked for awhile. Picked up some information on macros, learned about form, rest periods and tempos. Unfortunately for me, after months there was terrible pain in my wrist. Doing more research, I found out swapping Barbell Bench Press for Dumbbells negates any of those issues. Five years later, haven't had any related wrist issues since changing out barbell exercises for a dumbbell variant. Another issue I had was eating 3200 calories and not seeing the scale go up. 


When I asked about my intake, was told I had to be wrong. No boy needs that much food to maintain but months of careful calorie tracking showed me time and time again, anything under 3800 calories wasn't getting me north of 175lb. I had to take the information that was thrown at me and react accordingly with my own personal results: even when expert opinion was telling me otherwise. This is not to say I'm a better nutritionist than the folks I took my information from. They understood nutrition as a whole, while I saw it's effects on my body. Having to tweak what was given to me, to see the results I wanted.


Now three years after the discovery and I have a medical diagnosis for my wrist issues the actually correlates with my bodies inability to gain weight. While the main message stays the same, *progressive overload combined with a surplus of calories equals muscle building,* my routine is my own. Seeing good results with the exercises I've patched together from my own experience, general knowledge and personalised advice from specialist who've dealt with my unique issues.


**In Conclusion**


There's no reason to start any adventure now a days with zero knowledge. To much good, knowledgeable information is out there to justify reinventing the wheel but that's only meant to get you going. There are parts of every adventure undetermined and unknow until you're knee deep in the flames. Once you start developing down these paths, once you reach a certain level of mastery it becomes your duty to fine tune these plans to best be geared towards your individual results. At the end of the day they're not you and you're not them; take even expert advice with a grain of salt and think for yourself.",20,1
How much grinding is too much grinding?,"**After work, you rush home to get your gym gear on.** You‚Äôve settled on a two days on-one day off-three days on-two days off lifting schedule, with your days set at chest and shoulders, legs and abs, back and arms. You learned the virtue of rest days during quarantine. You also learned that a weighted vest maximizes your time spent walking after the gym, which is anywhere between four-and-a-half to ten miles per day.

Dinner is your one meal per day, and is usually some combination of steak, eggs, pork, and chicken. You feel guilty indulging in Quest cookies before bed, which have become the bane of your weekday existence but also what you most look forward to- the gift and the curse; the sacred and the profane. You spend a lot of time thinking about processed, low-sugar protein cookies. This is your life.

Don‚Äôt message me for fitness advice, because now you know everything I know. That‚Äôs the only way I know to do it. I only know the hard way, every time. I‚Äôve been fat- women treat you like a leering retard and people at work talk down to you. I‚Äôd rather drop dead from my awful schedule than deal with another second of that ever again.

**You actually tell people you go to bed at 8 o‚Äôclock, she enquired.** Earnestly. She thought this made me look crazy‚Äì that I don‚Äôt spend my free time watching streaming TV shows that remind me of the inherent badass nature of white suburban women; drinking wine; enjoying my time in a kind of free-floating, unscheduled manner. Unproductive. Repulsive. Enjoy your time off the work farm, plebs- I‚Äôll be here grinding myself to death.

I have nothing in common with people who don‚Äôt understand the urgency of getting to bed early; sleeping away my two hours at the gym, ten miles walking with twenty-pounds on my back, the 3,000 calories of meat- sleep substituting for meditation; dreaming productively; waking up with total mental clarity and peak creative mindset. Racing to work to write in a fucking notebook- the most important thing you do; what must be guarded before all else. Avoiding morning greetings and polite chit-chat from well-meaning co-workers; vicious mind-erasers and creative vampires, all of them. Everything in service of writing in the fucking notebook because writing in the notebook is all you fucking have.

**Lesson:** How much grinding is too much grinding? How much sacrifice is worth the 1% level up? Self-improvment is as addictive as anything else- and I don't have a good answer... it's hard to not think of time strictly as productivity and value, and it's hard to pass up writing or working out for something not as immediately rewarding as seeing friends. 

Obviously there must be *balance* found between using time productively and not letting all other aspects of your life wither- but anyone have a clue as to how?

How to deal with women like a boss!,[removed],0,1
Preparing for the next market crash/correction/pullback,"As the resident ""finance guy"", I just checked my portfolio in my main investing account. My 1 year growth Dec 2, 2019 to today is **184.19%**. While I am a Tesla bull, I didn't even start buying Tesla until after the split! (my holdings in this account are *only* up 42.22%)

This is what happens when you have a ""bucket"" of cash to pour into the market during massive pullbacks like we saw in March. In fact I made a video about my strategy back in February 2020 that allowed me to keep dollar cost averaging in, while also saving up cash for such crashes, pullbacks, and corrections.

Moving forward, I fully expect a massive market correction, especially in the EV space, sometime in late December or January. The Presidential election and Georgia runoff are also going to greatly influence things. 

My worst case scenario is with Tesla being added to the S&amp;P 500 that the comming correction initiates a larger correction to the S&amp;P 500, and then Biden gets inaugurated *AND* Dems take the Senate seats in the Georgia race. Combined we're going to see the markets go into freefall over fears of Biden getting his wishlist of changes to taxing investments and whatnot. Again, this is worst case scenario. I still think a correction in the EV space is coming as people selloff after the S&amp;P 500 inclusion, which creates downward pressure. Personally I won't be selling and if anything buy more during such an event.

Muscles and women,"I am not an expert in biology, I am just an undergrad bio student. But I believe that I can read and interpret studies well enough with my current scientific literacy. Now that, that is out of the way. I'd like to begin. Thank you for taking your time to read through all this.

**Introduction :- Attraction and components**
If you aren't new here, then you would know about women's dual mating strategy - long term dating strategy and short term dating strategy. Before someone objects that women do not have a dual mating strategy, I would like to state that this is in fact false. Women do have a dual mating strategy as evidenced by ([Durkee et al., 2019])(https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1474704919852918). Within this study in the background info there is a lot of redpill stuff such as women being more selective when it comes to mate choice due to the fact that giving birth and being pregnant is such a toll for women. But I am starting to digress now. Sexual attraction is believed to be a mutli-variant thing and things such as culture and biology have an impact. 

**Muscles and short term dating**
It has been concluded by the researchers within the study that muscles did in fact have an effect on sexual attraction. In fact it goes on to say that the the individual unit (the individual muscle e.g. Biceps) is not what is seen as attractive, but instead the collection of muscles is what is seen as attractive - basically be proportional and don't have huge arms but a DYEL chest. Different muscles supposedly had different meaning to, such as strong arms suggesting good fighter and abs suggesting good diet. In the short term dating strategy of women, genes are what is selected for mainly. Women are unable to distinguish between you being born with strong muscles and time spent at the gym (obviously they can tell, but speaking from an evolutionary perspective they cannot). As a result of this evolutionary mismatch you end up with women's brains thinking the time you spent in the gym is not a thing and you were in fact born with it

&gt;but it is unlikely that women‚Äôs evolved psychology would take this into account‚Äîdifferences in musculature should be interpreted as differences in mate quality, rather than simple differences in time and effort expended at the gym

As evidenced by this statement above. 

**Muscles and attractiveness pt2**
Men have near double the upper body strength of women, this mismatch in strength suggests the upper body strength is a sexually dimorphic feature and as such should be classified as a secondary sexual characteristic. Secondary sexual characteristics allow us to differ between men and women e.g. Height and voice are secondary sexual characteristics for men. It has been found that sexually dimorphic men are seen as more attractive in most cultures, even small things like [voice](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1474704917740466)(Smith, Olkhov, Puts and Apicella, 2017). Having huge muscles makes you more sexually dimorphic and as a result will make you look more attractive. In the sidebar somewhere or maybe it was in the maxims of TRP, the poster (who I forgot their name of, I am so sorry) states ""The masculine will always be attractive to the feminine"". This is your proof, being sexually dimoprhic seemed to have an impact on your attractiveness

**Interesting tidbits from the 1st study**

1. [There was a positive statistically significant difference in women's SPA (Self Percieved Attractiveness) and men's muscle size. The same was found for men too.](https://i.imgur.com/1QGQIhB.png)

2.Women reported preferring larger obliques, followed by glutes, abdominals, biceps, shoulders, triceps, calves, deltoids, quadriceps, pectoralis, latissimus dorsi, forearms, tibialis anterior, and trapezius

3. Muscles were also preferred for longer term partners too, having big muscles suggests you are also well-fed and able to get resources.

4. When muscles were put into 3 groups/factors (Factor 1 included obliques and abdominals; Factor 2 contained tibialis anterior, calves, forearms, and glutes; and Factor 3 included the rest of the muscles: pectoralis, triceps, deltoids, latissimus dorsi, biceps , shoulders , trapezius , and quadriceps) it was shown that women preferred muscles in factor 3 to be bigger than factor 1 and 2 - for men the same applied but it was a lot more exaggerated - https://i.imgur.com/6EMh35f.png

So in conclucsion as the obvious has been stated, women do prefer bigger muscles and that more self-percieved attractive women preferred men with bigger muscles too.",317,1

I've developed a hatred of god/nature," 

Something  has been severely bothering me lately. I might sound crazy but I have  to get this off my chest: God is the biggest machiavellian ruthless  dictator in all of human history.

Before  I rant, I want to make it clear that I'm not talking strictly about  catholic god. I mean god as a concept, whoever created this universe. Or  even if you believe in evolution. The problem is the same regardless of  your religion. My reasoning for this isn't tied to the bible or any  religious book, it's solely my own observations about this universe.  Let's begin.

Look at the world around you.

Isn't  something wrong here? Where's the class and morale? Why do crazy people  get all the money, status and child slaves they can possibly want? Why  can't you find a loyal boyfriend/girlfriend? Why do most people seem to  like you because of superficial material reasons? Why did your family  completely fall apart? Why are you so depressed, miserable and empty  inside? Why are you taking prescription drugs because you were fucked  over by genetic incurable disorders? Why are you so fat and unhealthy?  Why are you unable to cut out your bad habits?

Because god fucked you over.

It's  no wonder why you're fat. God gave you a low calorie amount and natural  food that tastes like shit (thus you get overweight).

He cursed you with genetic disorders that hold you back and make you miserable.

He  created a family unit that can so easily fall apart and is under the  whims of whether your parents want to fuck you over or not. Got a cruel  father who hates you? Tough shit.

He created a dominance/submission system that's hilariously broken and only rewards efficiency rather than morals.

He created a world with no meaning, purpose or entertainment and will be destroyed once the sun explodes.

And to some people, god just fucked them from birth with genetic disorders and cancer.

And  at any time, it can be taken all away. You can walk outside and be  shot, ran over or killed. See, god treats this sick world as a privilege  for you to live in.

This madman  has had BILLIONS of years to get it right. You are a conscious human  being who can feel joy and despair and you deserve better to be used as a  whipping dog to your natural slave masters. We are all just creators  who want freedom, to feel important and have a social circle that cares  about us. Basic reasonable shit, yet NONE of those needs are being met,  and I'm sick and fucking tired of it.

So what's the solution?

Well  chances are, we're not gonna break the 4th wall of this universe and  stick it to god himself, if there even is a 4th wall. I do think there's  a more practical solution though: Genetic engineering.

See,  a lot of these problems are rooted in your genetics. The junk food has  nothing wrong with it, it's your body that can't process it. It's your  genetics that get these disorders/cancer, etc. It's your natural  character traits that fuels this hierarchy system as well as your ego  and greed. If we were able to reverse engineer ourselves, we could  overcome almost all of these problems.

Imagine  coding in a new dopamine system that isn't atrociously exploitable, or  coding out viruses, diseases and disorders. That's the best solution  I've found so far. I dunno, I feel like a lot of our suffering could be  prevented if we reverse engineered ourselves rather than making  smartphones and video games to distract ourselves from this morbid  world.

Anyway, tell me what you think about all this. I'd like to hear any counterarguments too.",61,1

"Is Having Lots of Sex a Meaningless, Shallow Goal?","One thing guys struggle with and go back-and-forth with is this apparent contradiction between getting laid a lot, and being a ‚Äúgood‚Äù man. Mainstream media/normies tend to focus on the possible negative aspects of getting laid; chasing shallow, temporary highs, using women, having meaningless sex that doesn‚Äôt improve your life.

Quite a lot of guys have asked me if getting laid is superficial. It‚Äôs something a lot of guys worry about; am I just being shallow by chasing girls? Is this just self-indulgence, hedonism; is this ultimately just a waste of time?

Sure, if you chase a bunch of one night stands, and never improve yourself, and never aim to add to the lives of any of the girls you sleep with, then getting laid would quickly become very shallow, meaningless, and probably pretty depressing. But you‚Äôre not here for that shallow shit; you're on TRP because you want to improve yourself, you want to leave girls better than you found them, you want to build a kickass life that isn't shallow or focused on only one goal. You want sex that adds to your life, rather than being the sole-focus.

I wrote this article to help you give yourself permission to get laid. I don‚Äôt want you to hold back, or put aside your goal of building an awesome sex life, because you‚Äôre worried about this all being shallow or meaningless. And look, I get it ‚Äì I held back for the longest time because I thought what I was doing was shallow, stupid, a waste of time. I avoided going all-in, I didn‚Äôt put in the work I needed to put in, all because I had this deep, dark fear that getting laid might make me a worse (more shallow and vapid) human being.

And it wasn‚Äôt just that ‚Äì I was afraid to go all-in with getting laid, because I hadn‚Äôt yet handled my career/finances. I was almost 30 (and about to have a mid-life crisis) because my life wasn‚Äôt what I thought it was ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to be. I was poor ‚Äì massively in debt. I didn‚Äôt have a good job, let alone a career. All my mates were making hella $$$, getting promotions at work, and I was just sitting around being a mess. Who the fuck was I to think I had the right to go out and try to get laid, when my finances were a mess and my life wasn‚Äôt where it was supposed to be?

Thing is, I couldn‚Äôt focus on career. I couldn‚Äôt focus on making money. I couldn‚Äôt start a business. I couldn‚Äôt do much of anything; because I was so caught up in the fact I knew I couldn‚Äôt really get laid. I felt like a fucking failure with chicks. It ate away at me, it drove my self-esteem down, it made me feel worthless. I knew even if I had the best career in the world, even if I was making a million dollars a year, I‚Äôd feel like a loser if girls didn‚Äôt like me and I couldn‚Äôt get laid.

I know a bunch of guys who are crushing it with their work ‚Äì earning $200,000+ a year... yet they‚Äôre deeply unhappy. Why? Because they can‚Äôt get laid. As they‚Äôve told me, all the money in the world can‚Äôt replace knowing you can get laid.

I‚Äôm so so glad I made the decision a few years back to put my sex life first. The journey of getting laid has improved my life a billion times over. I‚Äôve been able to fall in love (something I used to be fucking terrified of), have healthy relationships, I‚Äôve been dating my girlfriend for 2 years as of 2020, I‚Äôve mentored a lot of girls and helped them get into self-improvement (some of them have even found TRP and used the info here to hit the gym, lose weight, start their own business).

And once you get to a point where your sex life is handled, when you feel like you can have as much sex as you want with no effort (or you‚Äôve found yourself an awesome girlfriend), you‚Äôll be in a position to move on to crushing the next goal.

I‚Äôm a much more confident, more understanding, more patient and happier person than I was before ‚Äì because I‚Äôve handled my own needs and fixed the thing that was making me the most unhappy: knowing I couldn‚Äôt get laid. I used to be bitter and hateful, angry at the world and at women for not sleeping with me; that‚Äôs all gone away now.

How high testosterone helps me in my life. 3 years on TRT.,"Hi, guys, so I was living with 380 ng/dL until I hit 33 years old. Suddenly I became aware that something is wrong with me, let skip all those medical and mental details, 72kg for 197cm is not that cool, for a start, anyway, I decided to make a change. A change from 380ng/dL to 1500 ng/dL.

And I would say, holy shit, it is all a very different life.

1) HUUUUUGE gains in the gym, but, after some thoughts, I switched to very easy pumping workout with same awesome muscles. When you are full of testosterone, you can just train for fun and look better than 95% of men.3 Hours of pumping every day, for example - an easy and funny routine. Like lifting 60kg for 150 reps straight and being fresh again after 5 mins, if you want to go into pumping. Frankly, you can do ANY crazy program in the gym and look awesome. I have 108kg now and not sure if I really want to be 115kg or 125kg, that is too much. But even with 100kg , mostly muscles, I feel awesome!

&amp;#x200B;

2) Overconfidence. An enormous overconfidence that you are the best in the world. And it makes wonders. People, especially women, feel that. And like that too!

&amp;#x200B;

3) Hilarious advantage in my marriage. Always leading. Always commanding. 100% domination. Wife acts like a sub, I think - available all the time, no underwear, only skirt at home, ok, you see, a marriage is just EASY. A woman smells testosterone and really thanks to TRP if you behave like an alpha with your woman - she is happy.  Or not, I don't give a fuck, I'm happy in my marriage. But if it suddenly disappears - I'm ready to fuck 20 years old girls, why not !

&amp;#x200B;

4) And, finally, endless energy. Always doing something and always trying to go somewhere. Can not explain this further.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, guys, if you are low-T - become a high-T men and do what the fuck you want!",58,1
"Roasted at Thanksgiving this year, and the legend of Ms. Slav","At Thanksgiving this year I got roasted... hot young [Ms. Slav](https://theredquest.wordpress.com/tag/ms-slav) was the main topic of conversation... even though she wasn't there and I've not seen her in a while, and none of the participants were present for [her presence at Thanksgiving two years ago](https://theredquest.wordpress.com/2018/11/25/ms-slav-at-thanksgiving-and-the-next-less-good-event). Word gets around, and a jealous relative brought her up early by saying, ""Whatever happened to your girlfriend Ms. Slav anyway?"" From there, others took up the theme, and I think extensive snide commentary and questions about her were an attack on my current arrangement, and haters love revenge. 

If you fuck with the social order of things, the social order of things will fuck with you back. Women hate seeing older guys with hot young chicks, not just because the older guy is unavailable but because seeing an older guy with a hot young chick *will give other guys ideas*, which is far worse than the one weird outlier guy who gets the girl every other guy wants. Guys hate seeing older guys with hot young chicks because the other guy is envious. Not all guys... some guys are past bullshit envy and will be genuinely happy for another guy getting one over on society and knobbing a tight young girl... but the majority want to be the hammer pounding the nail that sticks out. 

For most guys I think Thanksgiving, yesterday, would've been uncomfortable... for me it was a bit annoying to see the social order fighting back, with the representatives of the social order behaving like zombies, not even realizing who or what is pulling their strings... but it is what it is, and I knew that *I* was pulling a social retard move by bringing Ms. Slav into that part of my life. I should've ""accidentally"" put some pics of me fucking her on my phone and then ""accidentally"" had them on the screen, when I was supposed to be showing cute dog or apartment pics. If you want to be a player, some bad things will come from it, and it seems to me that most guys who've truly been players and written about it don't emphasize the bad parts. It can be lonely, and it can be alienating, and it can cause intense envy and jealousy. Older women are jealous they're not young and hot any more; guys are jealous that you're going to take home a hot slut and they're going to take home no one, or their heavy wife who doesn't like them any more anyway. Few women love men more than sugar. Few women love men more than sloth. 

Most people, once they exit their teens and mid-20s, rarely or never encounter a hot chick. They move to the suburbs... shack up... drive everywhere, getting fat as they do, cause they're too dumb and lazy to ride a bike... their main experience of raw beauty comes through the TV. Guys who are, or want to be, players... move downtown, or next to the college, and practice cold approach. They do things that'll put them in proximity to hot chicks. Dancing, volunteering, whatever it is hot chicks do, wherever it is hot chicks go. Our world, the player world, is very different from average, in ways that can be forgotten. Amateur wannabe players think about lines to say to chicks, and actual players think about logistics... where's the right place to live, where the hot chicks gather to get fucked, and how do I move her from the main dating venues back to my place... the logistics in most suburbs are worthless, which means that even guys who want to be players there mostly can't. If a guy can't be a player, he might as well shack up with the hottest acceptable chick he can find... let himself go a little... maybe he does some desultory sets in the gym, forgetting who he was... he leans back, gets into whatever hobbies fat guys in the suburbs get into... those hobbies never include bike mechanics... he lets go... that'll probably be me one day... not yet though. Not quite yet. 

I bet some of the couples who met Ms. Slav two years ago and saw her with me went home fired up, and fucked that night better and hotter than they had in months, or years. The guy imagined he was fucking Ms. Slav... and Ms. Slav was wearing more clothing than was typical of her... she is a disruptor of the social order... the woman imagined guys still getting excited for her... wishing she'd been more adventurous in college, wishing she'd said yes to more of the charming players who wanted to slip their fingers into her underwear... instead of her thinking so much about what her bitchy  friends thought... they weren't the ones who were going to get off... she was... and now she is invisible to the high caliber men... at least she has her children... she better guard her daughter... lest her daughter end up like Ms. Slav, and satisfied... the social order must be preserved... 

The right way to respond to the sniping, needless to say, is amused mastery and agree &amp; amplify. The comments don't bother you. You admit the other person is right. ""Yes, you're right, I probably am very bad."" ""Yes, you're right, she probably can't make her own decisions."" Shrug and smile. ""Sometimes you like who you like, you know?"" Never let them under your skin. ""You sure seem very interested in this... why is that?"" ""You seem pretty obsessed."" ""You do things your way, I do things my way."" Let the hostility play out in the subtext, never the text. They're the haters with the problems. You don't see the problems. You smile. What's their problem? You don't quite see it.

Yesterday, the people whose lives have nothing of real interest in them saw a glimmer of interest and tried to multiply that glimmer into something real. It's possible to love family and not agree with family. Boredom is the modern human condition and if someone escapes from it, particularly in a way that others cannot follow, he must be dragged back into the condition of boredom. I admire even the old ladies at the sex clubs, despite them not appealing to me or most men, because they've not yet let boredom win. What's there to talk about, if not how someone violated the rules? Then you'd have to have something to say, apart from how much you like that new TV show, the one where you don't know if the hot leads will do it, or won't. The tension keeps you on the edge of your seat. Isn't it exciting to watch other people's erotic drama? Wasn't it nice, you don't mean to be implying, when you had some of your own? 

Jealousy is a kind of magic, at times. Read enough cheating stories, or hear them after a few drinks, and you'll find that jealousy can generate the intense feeling that generates hot sex. Esther Perel's books touch this. Inject a little jealousy into the average, erotically dead life, and good things may happen... but the people to whom the good things happen, will hate you for it. Jesus had to die. 

He had to die for the story to work. 

He dies at age 33: a time when the top players haven't reached their sexual zenith, but when the average guy is done. 

A man who makes things different, who is different, needs to be attacked, and ideally needs to die, because the social order always wins, in the short term. 

Ms. Slav wasn't at Thanksgiving... but her ghost may be at Thanksgiving from here, out.",20,1
"They are training us to become monsters, and they might succeed after a decade or two","The video [10 Rejections of Intimacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6LLz_2u4vo) explains the 10 ways a NPD person would reject intimacy with a female.

The irony I felt through every minute of it is that it is describing **exactly** what we all **must** do, to make the female stop her whoring around, reject her orbiter ""friends"", get to her senses and start chasing the prize: us.

We have all (in first 20 or 30 years of life) acted like a decent human being around our partners, we actually enjoyed the warm feelings when we cuddled with ""our"" female, and as a reward she withholds sex, then cheats and eventually destroys anything resembling a relationship with such a monster.

This collective female insanity eventually succeeds in teaching us with constant punishments, to stop doing what we men would actually like to do, and start doing exactly what females ""apparently hate"". Not because it would be our pleasure to do that, but to STOP the female from behaving in a way all of her kind behaves all of the time without a punishment hanging overhead.

No wonder many of us see relationshits as disgusting pile of garbage.

The only kind of girls who would hold back, from reacting negatively to anything nice are those, which are not hot, and hang on to you simply because they know they can not get anyone better. A female like that will still have 0 attraction, give you rare transactional mercy sex just enough so you have a reason to not dump her ass. Then she will ""tolerate"" our wish to cuddle with her and we will be able to live in an illusion that a relationship could ever be something normal where people act like human beings to each other.

If that's the best a modern relationshit can offer, no wonder we all go MGTOW.",43,1
Modern dating is fucked for both men and women,"**She did all the right things this time around.** She went through a phase where she‚Äôd have men from hook-up dating apps meet at her house- a kind of post-divorce mania. She‚Äôd be drinking, of course- she couldn‚Äôt meet strangers for sex otherwise.

Not this time, she told me. She wanted to take things slowly; go on real dates, pedal boats and wineries. The strawberry festival. Long conversations in female-owned coffee shops about travel. This was how to get a boyfriend. This was how to fall in love.

And once enough flowers were gifted, enough day-trips to the country were taken; walks in the park and train station county fairs. Once there was enough for it not to seem cheap, she had him over for sex. Text the next day, like clockwork- likely pre-written, copied and pasted; he doesn‚Äôt feel a strong enough connection. They don‚Äôt have the kind of chemistry he‚Äôs looking for. He wishes her luck.

He knew what was needed to get sex- money to spend, expectations to meet. He‚Äôs NASA developing the astronaut pen because he doesn‚Äôt have the balls to be a Soviet, alone with a pencil. Cost of doing business. Rats on a sinking ship- grabbing at what we can, both hands, blood everywhere. She learned her lesson this time, she tells me. Come by and fuck me early, she texts. She had a date that night.

[**Excerpt from [""The King of Hell""](https://killtoparty.com/2020/11/07/the-king-of-hell/)**]

**Lesson:** Modern dating is fucked for both men and women- women have more options, always, but suffer from the *paradox of choice*- they were never meant to have this many options presented to them *all at once* in a landscape of completely acceptable, taboo-less promiscuity- where the tigers rule the roost, and men have no choice but to get vicious in order to get what they want. 

**Your job is simple- get vicious.**

Only fuck with dimes,"This is something I learned recently. I had a girlfriend who was beautiful. I fell back to my blue pill ways. Despite how beautiful she was, she was bad news. She talked about all the dick she sucked and all the crack she‚Äôs smoked and all the shit she‚Äôs injected. But she was easily a 9/10. Eventually it didn‚Äôt work out obviously, that shit never does.


For the past month, I have been broken. Finally I pull a honey. Back in March I was fucking some stinky ass fat whore whose puss reminded me of a black hole. It was disgusting.


Last night something happened: my buddy brought his girl out to the bar. She acted like a complete fucking slut all night. We eventually went back to his house. Every time this guy had his back turned she started making out with me. She got very sexual and was rubbing her ass on my dick all night. At a few different points she tried to get me alone in the bedroom but he walked in every time and ruined it. Eventually I got kicked out at 5 am. This girl is a 9/10 petite blonde far right winger that sits around and smokes cigarettes all day, basically my dream. I think I‚Äôm gonna go pay her a visit at her work soon. 


So I‚Äôve realized something. I‚Äôm not fucking around with ugly bitches no more. All this redpiller shit is bogus. You just gotta make it. Once you make it you‚Äôll never go back. Pretty soon your friends girls will be trying to suck you off and fuck you. I‚Äôm a piece of shit, low life street level petty criminal that lives in poverty. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever get out of that lifestyle. But I‚Äôve read redpill for years, and I can say this. You just gotta be it. There‚Äôs no cheat, there‚Äôs nothin you can do but just be alpha as fuck, no exceptions. Girls act completely crazy and go nuts for an alpha male, they‚Äôll grind their ass on your dick in front of their boyfriend of years with no shame.",20,1
Frame: You can't lose what you never had.,"So one of the recurring themes I see around goes something like this ""lost frame, insert problem"". The problem is that there's plenty of misunderstanding of what frame actually is. You didn't lose it, you never had it. I'm in the mood to do some writing, and often take a different path on things. So here goes!

Frame itself is an esoteric concept, but there's plenty of things that play into it. Frame as a concept, has been around for a long time, and used in various different contexts. My first dealings with it came from back in the PUA era, before there was a manosphere, TRP, etc.

So what is frame then?  
Frame IS your core set of values, beliefs, worldview, ethics, and sense of self. There's a legitimately real reason that young guys have weak frames, it's because they haven't fully figured out the idea of who they are. The same applies for guys with half baked belief systems, superficial values and so on. I think here is where I was pretty lucky to have an interest in philosophy. Many people go through life and never actually question their own belief systems, let alone how that has an effect on how they interact with the world. I was already in my 30s when I started to question what I believed and why. This is one of the fundamental and core concepts of TRP. Even older men get locked into the wrong paths, that just cements them into the frame they have (and it's generally a weak one). That is to say older men have reinforced some bad beliefs.

**Most People Have Weak Frames**  
This is true of modern men and women.  A lot of modern men have frames like tube men (the dancing inflatable used car lot things). Blowing whichever way the wind goes, or moving at random. It's no surprise that even FEWER men of the younger generations have weak frames, since they're learning from men that likely have weak frames themselves.  People often take the path of least resistance, and because of that there's not many that are truly tested. 

So then how do we go about building a strong frame?  
This is really the hard part. If we use an analogy that personal frame is the same as the framing for a house, we need to go and do an inspection for weak or rotten boards. That inspection comes from inflection. Diving deep and figuring out ""why"" you hold the various beliefs that you do. If you actually do that you'll probably find you didn't actually come to a lot of them; family, society, religion, etc made those choices for you. A board that was put there from someone else CAN be good, but you have to decide to keep it. 

Identity itself is a complex thing, with plenty wrapped up into it. Part of having a strong frame is knowing who you are, and ACTUALLY believing it. This is where I disagree with at least some of the stuff that's said around here. ""I am the prize"" is deceptively dangerous in this way, because everyone around you knows it's bullshit (including you). "" Whereas ""my time is valuable"" is actualization of your importance.  Even then a lot of you youngers guys haven't had that actualization yet either. You never woke up one day and realized ""holy shit that happened 20 years ago"". You have to test those beliefs you hold in the real world. 

I'll stop here because going further leads more into congruence and calibration. 

TLDR:  
Frame is who you are. Find your beliefs, test them, then reinforce or discard them.",35,1
Act &gt; think,"Are you inexperienced?   


If you are, it does no good sitting around this place filling your brain with information. If you do so, you're going to become overly analytical. Girls are simple. Girls are predictable. And girls are very emotionally attuned - no matter how much you study, if you're inexperienced, the girl you're with is going to know. She might find it endearing. She might find it cute. Or she may find it creepy. Regardless, she's not going to be hot &amp; bothered to get you home at the end of the night. Take it easy on your brain and get off this subreddit. If you're inexperienced, its going to do you very little good to be here. It's going to make you jaded, judgemental, misogynistic, and cerebral none of which is attractive to chicks who are looking for no-strings-attached sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

They want you to get it. They want to know that other chicks are into you. They want to know that you're experienced, that other girls are fighting for your attention. Girls want to win you. Girls want to chase you. Girls want to win a prize. They don't want a needy, inexperienced blindly romantic boy to be drooling over them. In fact, if you show any sign of being needy, of wanting her more than she wants you, she's going to be turned off. As backward as it seems, this indicates to her that your life is so boring, so uneventful, so lacking in color that she has now become the prized item, the most interesting aspect of your life.   


Maybe I'm being a little hard, maybe I'm judging TRP a little too hard. Maybe you should read the sidebar once through prior to dating, if you're inexperienced. It helps to know how to handle a shit test. It helps to know what a woman is saying to you with her body. It helps to know that a woman is only going to be attracted to you based on the value you provide in looks, in physique, in status, in intelligence, in articulation, in social connection, in your overall stature &amp; presence. But it only gets your foot in the door. Read once and GTFO. 

&amp;#x200B;

Go live. Get off your phone. Get off you computer. Go take risks. Go do things you enjoy. Go talk to people. Go meet women. Put yourself out in the open. Never fear judgement. Bring your best self foward. And think with optimism. Reality will respond in kind. Reality will love you if you love yourself, if you trust yourself, and if you trust the world to hone you into the best man you can be. But you have to get off your computer. You have to get out of the house. And you have to faith even when you're down on your luck, when times are hard, when you're alone, isolated, poor, and low. Trust your hardships.   


And go get experience in all facets of life. Are you going to build a business from scratch in trail &amp; error. Or are you going to read and passively fantasize about doing so all day long? Are you going to sexualize a conversation with a cute girl? Or are you going to read and fantasize about doing so all day long? Are you going to go accidentally cock block yourself on your first date? Or are you only going to read about other men's failures? Are you going to calibrate yourself based on your experienced failures? Or are you going to read about other men doing so?   


Put in the work. Otherwise, you're worthless. You're spinning in circles. Nothing is happening really. Your just escaping reality by gorging on information. Your brain is getting fat, overworked, and inefficient. Get streamlined and go get experience even if you fail for a very long time. Makes me angry to think that people just sit around fantasizing rather than acting. Go fucking act. You'll be grateful in three years when you're experienced with chicks, when you can consistently fuck hot chicks and not even care if you ever see them again or not. Your life should be rich. You should be satisfied with or without women. You should have a life that you enjoy living. You should pursue your passions, your interests. And you should get experience in all that you care to pursue. If you do so, you'll get all the heavy lifting out of the way. You'll be on auto-pilot. And all those people around you who were pussies, who were scared to act, who settled, who were lazy, who didn't get experience, they will admire you, they will envy you, they will want to have your life. But all they're going to get is an earful of complaints from chicks who can't seem to lock a man like you down. Why would you ever want to be locked down if you're a high value man? The higher value you are, the better your life is when you're free. The world is an abundant place. If you're willing to act, to learn, to get exprience, to perfect yourself, you will have all that you ever wanted, all that you ever needed. Truth is most people are scared to ask for what they truly want because deep down they know it takes tremendous effort, energy, focus, and will-power. It's easier to be lazy and complain than it its is to be proactive and achieve.",3,1

Why a couple shouldn't have kids unless they are rich.,"The world is composed of a lot of people who just want to drag others down. Basically it's all competition. Why bring someone into this world if the whole point is to put them in such a jeopardy (i.e if they have to survive they should compete for the mere basic amenities which should be avialable for everyone no matter what). Why even start such a race. Better is not to participate in a race to death. Now, I get it, there is a lot of positivity in this world and people are not always terrible blah blah.. But when it comes down to core survival, which is securing a partner, getting a job, putting table on the food etc, these same people wouldn't mind adopting unfair means to do so. All this positive people and other shit is an island in the middle of the ocean of negativity. Why even be a part of such a world. That is why, don't have kids and you will be doing them a  favor.

Why we want kids is because of basic biology. We don't want to feel alone in the end years of our lives, we want to feel important. Even if it means pushing them into a world full of predators. Just think how sick it is.",5,1

I have blocked a couple, about 3-6 girls(8-10 rating) that I‚Äôve talked to (one was literally a model). I don‚Äôt know the exact reason why I did. I chatted with 2 frequently but it was on and off so I would consider them old friends. I feel like I blocked them because I feel like I was being judged by them too much. Felt like I needed to entertain them. Felt forced. 

It could be that I‚Äôm just too lazy to talk to other people on the regular. The red pill comes in and I think these girls have so many guys following them that I don‚Äôt feel the need to compete with (the prize hasn‚Äôt been that big for me). They want me but I don‚Äôt truly want them? 

Question is am I weird for doing this? Or does anyone relate to me? Why do I block them?

Whenever we hit a major roadblock in life, whether it‚Äôs girls, or professionally, it‚Äôs very tempting to leave that path behind and try a different path instead of doubling down and focusing on overcoming the obstacle.

* You may be an absolute beginner with girls. And after your best attempt at creating an online dating profile you could only get a couple dates - both of which didn‚Äôt go anywhere - so instead of trying other things like social circle game or cold approach you decide fuck it I‚Äôm just not attractive enough for girls and decide to escape reality with video games or other addictions instead of working on yourself
* Maybe you‚Äôre not getting the results at the gym that you want. Your lifts just stay the exact same while you see everyone else skyrocketing past you. So eventually you stop going and focus on your career instead of figuring out how your body works and getting your nutrition right.
* Or maybe you started a new business. But you just can‚Äôt seem to get people to buy your product no matter how hard you try to sell it. So instead of learning more about what your customer wants or learning sales skills, you decide fuck it, 95% of new businesses fail, I‚Äôll just go back to my career

Not only does this prevent you from reaching our goal, it robs you of the BEST opportunity to learn and grow by overcoming a difficult problem

You wanna stop giving a fuck what people think?

You wanna be able to walk into a room and instantly have respect?

You wanna stop being a nervous little fake alpha bitch who just reads article after article on the red pill instead of taking action?

Then stop pussying out at the first sign of difficulty, or the second sign, or the third, or the 100th...

**It‚Äôs not over until I win.**

Commit that phrase to memory.¬†

As long as it‚Äôs something worth doing, **‚ÄúIT'S NOT OVER UNTIL I WIN.‚Äù** (Unless your goal is to get into the NBA at age 40)

If you want something badly whether it‚Äôs girls or money then you should thank the Lord that he put so many obstacles and roadblocks for you to overcome.¬†

How else can you grow into the man you want to be other than doing hard shit?

Okay, so you finally ready to go on your hero‚Äôs journey to get whatever the fuck it is you want? Good. Here are the steps.¬†

You‚Äôll find these steps in just about every movie you ever liked as a kid. Star Wars, The Matrix, Lion King, you name it.

Every movie you ever liked as a kid used this exact formula for their hero because it‚Äôs the one most consistent with real life and the one audiences can relate to.

**THE ORDINARY WORLD**

This is the ordinary little world you currently exist in. It‚Äôs not good. You‚Äôre not happy because you‚Äôre lacking something, or maybe something is taken from you...

For me, this was my life after college. Just work in an accounting job. Play video games with friends. No girls interested in me. Rinse and repeat.

**THE CALL TO ADVENTURE**

This is where you are given a challenge, problem, or adventure. Often it appears as a blunder, or chance. This stage establishes the goal of the hero.

For me, this is when I first discovered RedPill on the internet and devoured every single article I could every night. I felt a deep sense of curiosity, like a part of me knew that there was an answer to my problems out there, waiting to be found.

**THE REFUSAL OF THE CALL**

This is where you‚Äôre initially hesitant to go on your journey. You‚Äôre like is this really for me?

For me, it was just this feeling that I didn‚Äôt know enough. So instead of taking action I just kept reading and reading.

**MEETING WITH THE MENTOR**

This is where you encounter a wise figure who prepares you for the journey. This figure (or item) gives advice, guidance, or an item, but cannot go with you.

For me, this was an article posted here on How To Get Laid Like A Warlord. The main idea of that article is that looks don‚Äôt matter and your frame is everything. So I decided to do everything the author said and focus only on game and unshakeable frame!

**CROSSING THE THRESHOLD**

And now you‚Äôve finally committed to the task! You decide to go out and approach girls, or actually fill in the paperwork to start your own business!

For me, this was going out with a friend and hitting on girls together at the club. I remember falling flat on my face at this point. Girls would give me one word answers and ignore me, even though I was confident as fuck and thought I was king of the world. None of that mattered.

**TESTS, ALLIES, TEACHERS, AND ENEMIES**

And now you the hero have discovered that you‚Äôve bitten off more than you can chew. This isn‚Äôt going to be as easy as you thought it was going to be, so 3 things can happen.¬†

1) you give up, crawling back to your beta bitch ways

2) you keep trying, but refuse to accept advice from anyone else because your ego is too high

3) you recognize that you can‚Äôt do it alone so you go out to make allies and find mentors to guide you. Like Luke did when he looked for Yoda for training.

I decided to choose option 3 in my journey but unfortunately, I picked the wrong mentor - RSD... and lost $2997 on a boot camp while still getting no results with girls.

That‚Äôs right, not everyone you meet on your journey will be helpful. Some will unintentionally hurt you on your journey by giving you bad advice while others will straight up try to destroy you before you can succeed.

But it‚Äôs very important to remain open minded and continue meeting new people and absorbing new ideas in order to find the ones that will work for you. If you decide fuck it, I can figure this out by myself, you‚Äôll end up like those guys on the black pill forums that say they‚Äôve approached 100 girls with zero results or those business owners that have been struggling to make it for 15 years with mediocre results

**APPROACH TO THE INNERMOST CAVE**

This is where you‚Äôve finally come to the edge of the dangerous place where the ""object of the quest"" is hidden. Maybe you finally met the right teacher and acquired all the knowledge to succeed that you were missing before

For me this was meeting a good mentor online who fixed all of the mistakes I was making, like not talking loud enough or not dressing up and doing my hair before going out. Or doing the wrong weird HIIT workouts in the gym instead of doing heavy compound lifts...

Unfortunately, most guys never get this far. Because they think they can do it by themselves like a real hero. Notice how none of the heroes from your favorite movies as a kid ever did it alone. They all had substantial help. And this is because in real life, behind every successful man is an entire network of allies and mentors who helped him along the way. There can never be great success without other people to aid you on your journey.

And this is why you see so many guys doing the exact same things year after year. Running their own version of game, sleeping with girls they‚Äôre not interested in, playing it safe with their business and copying the competition instead of learning how to scale.

**THE SUPREME ORDEAL**

And now the moment of truth! You have all the tools and knowledge to succeed now. All your previous delusions about what it would take to succeed have been shattered by the cold measuring stick of results.

So what do you do when it‚Äôs time to finally apply your new knowledge on a date to get your first lay?

Or launch your first pay per click traffic campaign for your business?

Are you gonna seize the moment and finally win or succumb to the pressure and fail yet again?

For me this was going out to the clubs again with my newfound knowledge of what it takes to succeed - focusing on looks, tonality, and body language instead of pickup lines.

**REWARD, OR SEIZING THE SWORD**

If you failed, it‚Äôs time to take a step back and reassess where you went wrong. Now is not the time to give up. Now is the time to double down and keep fighting for what‚Äôs yours.

Go back to the tests, allies, teachers, and enemies step and search for new mentors to aid you in your path.

If you succeeded in defeating Scar or Agent Smith, or The Death Star, then it‚Äôs time to take your reward.

With girls its losing your virginity

Or securing your first lay with a 9/10 or getting your first threesome if you‚Äôre more advanced

With business it‚Äôs finally hitting that first huge campaign that scales and makes you hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single month.

For me, this is banging 15 girls in the span of half a year. Made me realize that this new knowledge really works.

**THE ROAD BACK**

And now that you got what you want, you must deal with the consequences of your actions. You may be pursued by remaining enemy forces. Or maybe new enemies pop up that you didn't see coming. 

Life doesn't just end in happily ever after once you get what you want. The demons often continue to haunt you, even with your new powers.

For me, this was going on a dry spell after a few plates fell off after COVID hit. And thus, the journey continues.

**RESURRECTION**

One final test is required for the purification and rebirth of the hero. Alternatively, it may be a miraculous transformation.

Think Neo dying before becoming ""The One.""

There are no allies or mentors here to aid you here because you've progressed too far on your journey, and you already know the basics, so now you must learn to use everything you learned to give birth to something new.

For me, this was rethinking everything I thought I knew about game and adapting to the new virtual world by learning how to build a high value Instagram to hook girls in my sleep after having a good initial approach in person and swapping numbers.

**THE RETURN**

This is where you return to the ordinary world bearing the elixir. Common elixirs are treasure, love, freedom, wisdom, or knowledge. A defeated hero is doomed to repeat the hero's journey again until he succeeds.

For me, this was returning to my normal world, with the knowledge that I can consistently get laid whenever I go out to approach now. It‚Äôs not such a big deal anymore and now I can focus on bigger and better things, like becoming a multi-millionaire.

Oftentimes, this hero will then go on to inspire other heroes, thus continuing the cycle because as we all know:

&gt;Through action, a Man becomes a Hero  
&gt;  
&gt;Through death, a Hero becomes a Legend  
&gt;  
&gt;Through time, a Legend becomes a Myth  
&gt;  
&gt;And by learning from the Myth, a Man takes action

**SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?**

You may think that this road isn‚Äôt for you, that you‚Äôre too weak to be **FAILING** over and over again and to pick yourself back up after falling flat on your face...

But I‚Äôve seen it time and time again.

There‚Äôs a hero in every man if you're just willing to go all in and not surrender.

Here is something for you to consider. All of us, the whole of humanity, are remarkable. Unlike almost all souls ‚Äì which remain locked in unconsciousness ‚Äì our souls have achieved consciousness.

In a war between infinite souls, we are the ones who made it. We have beaten astounding odds to be where we are today. You may not realize this, but you are already the most stupendous of miracles.

You are so miraculous that it is astounding that you are here at all. You may be one in 600 million! Male ejaculate can contain as many as 600 million sperm. Only one of those was you (or, actually, half of you; your father provided the sperm half of you and your mother the egg half of you).

All 600 million might have failed to impregnate your mother‚Äôs egg. Or any of the others ‚Äì hypothetical brothers or sisters ‚Äì might have made it instead of you. But, no, you were the one who ventured through the ultimate assault course ‚Äì because a woman‚Äôs body regards male sperm as an alien entity that must be destroyed, just like some virulent infection ‚Äì and you succeeded where all the others failed.

You are one in six hundred million! You have beaten lottery odds. So why are you so humble, so beaten down by life, so cowardly, so willing to accept the shit treatment you get? You are already a remarkable warrior, you are already a god who has achieved greater feats than any of the most legendary heroes.

Achilles was nothing compared with you! Your sperm‚Äôs feats would make Alexander The Great shudder in fear.¬†

Stop cowering and live up to what you have already achieved. Make your life the reflection of the supreme struggle you endured and over which you have triumphed.

Remember, one in six hundred million!!! Can you achieve the same heroic success in the real world? Why not? Who‚Äôs holding you back except yourself?

You have already beaten staggering odds just to make it into this world. Remember that the next time you‚Äôre too much of a pussy to approach that girl, the next time you‚Äôre too scared to start a business, the next time you decide to play it safe instead of going after what you really want.

Thank you very much and Happy Motherfucking Thanksgiving!",67,1
A quick reminder as to why we tell you to remember that hypergamy doesn‚Äôt care when your LTR goes on vacation,"This is a short post and I debated whether or not to share it. My family and another family are pretty intertwined and we occasionally all go on vacation together. 2 years ago we went to Mexico and I fucked one of the daughters. After getting back stateside, I was bombarded by messages from her boyfriend (who she only mentioned right as I was about to enter her) going off on me.

The girl and I kept in vague contact but a year ago I deleted all social media so we haven‚Äôt spoke since. Our families are meeting up again in 2 weeks and my curiosity gets the best of me so I made another Instagram and message her asking if she‚Äôs going.

After a quick convo she says how she‚Äôs ‚Äúhappy she‚Äôs going to see me‚Äù and ‚Äúgoing to try and make me tired of her‚Äù. 

All this but if you go to her page, you see pics of her and a different BF than last time.

2 years with low to no contact and a boyfriend but once she‚Äôs in vacation mode it no longer matters.

I plan on having a great time. Just a quick example for any of you guys that find yourself in a LTR that wants to go on vacation without you.",4,1
Reflection,"Long time casual lurker of this sub, having read the recent 'your country hates you' I have decided to contribute. It was a very good read, and all very true, however, my approach is to fight rather than flee.

First of all lets address the 'enjoy the decline' theory. In the 80s, 90s, and even the early 2000s you could become a boss, bang your gorgeous secretary or other female work colleagues and be applauded for it by your peers. Now you can lose your job if a malicious woman who managed to spend ten minutes alone with you decides you've harassed her. Enjoying that decline yet? How about being unable to comment on a woman in public? What happens when, if you're a UK citizen, the lunatics finally win and get sexism prosecuted as hate speech? If you think that's far fetched, the Scottish police recently charged a man for having his dog do a Nazi salute on Facebook. It can, and will, happen if you do nothing about it and 'enjoy the decline.‚Äô There won't be a society left to enjoy, hell, its already hostile to straight men and you can bet the gays are next on the chopping block. Even the black men, darlings as they are to the progressives, are feeling the heat. JK Rowling, a proud feminist, is being kicked to the curb for daring to say that putting a wig on a man and calling him a woman don't make it so. How long until the groomer teacher at your son's school manipulates him into believing he's a girl whilst you're too busy working fifty hour weeks, then has him removed from your custody for the 'child abuse' of you not recognising his new identity? If you don't do anything, its coming. By now, and judging by how things have been devolving, you should see that enjoying the decline will be simply impossible in a rather short amount of time. Either we will end up in a completely hostile society where we serve as a serf class (it could be argued we already are), or other, stronger cultures that have retained masculine structures take over. It will be interesting to see you attempt to generate 'kino' on a woman covered head to toe in a black veil.

So what‚Äôs my point? What‚Äôs the solution? Firstly, assuming this sub survives the coming purge (unlikely) we can use it or other sites like it as a spring board to educate young men. This site does this to an extent, but is also full of 18 year olds and their amazing observations having spoken to a girl for the first time ever. A lot of stuff on here is, frankly, cringe, to use a popular phrase. But I digress. To solutions. As I have mentioned, educating men in the way women actually work. I remember hiking with my friend once, talking about various troubles in our lives. I said to him ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt get my head down and start get my self a good degree and a good job I‚Äôm never going to get an attractive wife.‚Äù His reply was ‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt worry girls care about your personality you‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù This is the response of many, many men, and is complete bollocks. Personality for women is what intelligence is for men- secondary, right after the pretty face, charming demeanour and massive knockers. Coincidentally, a successful man will likely have a personality women almost universally find attractive. Driven, intelligent, dominant. If a girl marries you for your personality, per what the red pill knows about the psychology of women, she is a moron and you should really be trying to do better. Being able to support a family is for most women a pre-requisite, and this isn‚Äôt going to change. These men will also hold that ‚Äòwomen love jerks‚Äô (just not their girlfriend she‚Äôs special), but also swallow the feminist crap that women don‚Äôt want masculine men. All the way until she leaves them with half of their money. Subs like this and its resources, as well as Youtube commentators and Podcasts can educate, and believe me it is actually working. Many of you younger guys may have noticed in the last few years a slow rise of groups with young men who regularly go against the feminist curve. Its a small change, but it is there, and it may continue. The best way to cultivate these attitudes is to form all male friendship groups, and do manly things. Mental I know. Truly, brotherhood is our greatest defence from feminism. The best bulwark against the nature of women is strong men, not the snivelling ass kissers which have pervaded society since the boomer generation.

The idea of brotherhood and restoring traditional masculinity only carries us so far however. We know that women‚Äôs interests have a deleterious effect on society, but how do we prevent this in government and the workplace? This is remarkably simple, if not easy. If one simply removes the factors giving unfair advantages to women, men will inevitably rise to the top. Men, if raised as men, simply have more drive. And, in the near genius range of IQ, outnumber women eight to one. All we need is a level playing field and its game over. Further, the very biology of women prefers Male leaders, watch that play out when strong men recapture politics. To do so however, the media and other institutions need to be reigned in, and the feminist narrative thoroughly discredited. Do so with logic to men, and with strength to women, if what the red pill says about frame is true they will fall in line.

So there are my main solutions: cultivate male friendship groups, reign in the institutions, remove policies that favour women at the expense of men, and lift lift lift. That last one by now should just be common knowledge. Finally, we must cultivate a masculine environment. Sports are a fantastic way to do this in men, and your general attitude and behaviour will rub off on your friends, especially if you‚Äôre successful and good with women. Sometimes the simplest thing like asserting that the orange man is not bad in public ‚Äògasp,‚Äô can go a long way to shape opinion andremoralise allies. Below will follow some observations.

. That guy who‚Äôs ‚Äòsuch a jerk,‚Äô is not a jerk. You‚Äôre just not used to a forceful man looking out for his own interests and getting what he wants. If he‚Äôs not cheating to get ahead you‚Äôre just being a pussy.

. The gradual tempering of language in politics is a result of feminine influence, Churchill was famously foul mouthed.

. Women never looking to check if the toilet seat is up is the ultimate demonstration of their utter lack of understanding of personal responsibility. Its not their fault for not looking, its yours for not considering them not looking.

. Female influence in politics eventually leads to authoritarianism, as they attempt to bubble wrap society and remove any risk from life- it come from mothering biology. Many women would rather choose safety than freedom.

.The 60s until the early 2000s were the best time to be a man in society, and the best time to run ‚Äògame.‚Äô

. Being nice will not get you laid, because being nice is not a suitable offering in exchange for sex, and if your intention was to be nice to get laid you‚Äôre actually not being nice because you‚Äôre only appearing to be so to get something in return. ‚ÄòBe nice‚Äô is what your mommy told you to do, Simp.

. The best way to learn to socialise and get good with girls is to go out and do it, using an internet forum solely as your social learning will invariably make you more of an autist.

. Being big and aesthetic is brilliant, but out of skinny and cut and big and soft women seem to prefer the guy that is simply bigger. Likely this projects power.

. You should spend most of your time in life competing, its part of being a man

. Any reversal of the current paradigm will require one or more decades, this isn‚Äôt a quick fix

. If your friends are losers your probably are as well

. The white middle class have collectively lost their minds

.With the state of most men nowadays if you‚Äôre even an average man by 20th century standards you will look like a demi-God to the mere mortals around you

. Per ‚Äòyour country hates you,‚Äô a very good point is raised, feminism also reduces the pool of desirable women. I recently slept with a stunning girl who is a fantastic musician with whom I will never find myself in a relationship because she was raised by a single mom, is covered in tattoos and has mental issues from the lack of a dad.",23,1

Your Suppose To Be Looking For A Wife,"Slipping into the frame of alpha is easy. If you just come from the viewpoint of looking for a GOOD wife from every woman you meet.

So, your day starts you piss brush your teeth throw some clothes on and go to wherever you have to go. Along the way there are girls you see. You should be chatting them up to see if they are wife material and they‚Äôll respect you for it.

After awhile you take one of these girls out for coffee because she was nice to you, had some things in common and gave you her number. While you are on the date do you talk about how pretty she is/or daily hot topics. Or do you ask questions and create scenarios that test if she‚Äôd be a good wife? She‚Äôd respect you more if you did the latter.

A few years later, after a few or a few dozen coffee dates. You have a girl who‚Äôs been coming over everyday for the past few months. She doesn‚Äôt pay rent though. Do you make her pay rent or do you let her chill for free? Just think what would you do if she was your wife?

That girl who was coming over everyday is now paying rent. It‚Äôs been going on for awhile. Every day you created scenarios to test if she‚Äôs wife material(That‚Äôs a post for different day). She‚Äôs never failed. Guess what that‚Äôs your wife.

Feminism Has Always Been a One-Way Street,"One of the most important (but highly unnoticed) aspects of modern feminism is that, in their posturing and idiotic efforts to try and prove themselves, women have almost *never* originated anything new that they could call their own. Instead what they've really done is merely followed in men‚Äôs footsteps, and tried imitating us in everything that they do.

Consider the following examples from history:

1. Generalship

After his defeat at the [Battle of Salamis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis), Persian [Emperor Xerxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I) made the remark that on that day, his men had fought like women and his women‚Äîmeaning his ally [Queen Artemisia of Halicarnassus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_I_of_Caria)‚Äîlike men. Ever since then and all the way up to Margaret Thatcher, the *best* thing one could say about a successful woman was that she was like a man, and the *worst* thing one could say about a man, that he was like a woman.

2. Dressing

After committing murder, Heracles was punished by being made to wear women‚Äôs clothes (and also engage in women‚Äôs work, but that isn't relevant here) for one year. Fast forward to today. In Iran, the tradition of pushing men by making them dress as women endures to the present day. All throughout history, *very few* men have voluntarily put on women‚Äôs clothing. Yet hundreds of millions of women who seek liberation, from the oppression of ""The Patriarchy‚Ñ¢"", have taken to wearing men's trousers. For reasons beyond my comprehension.

3. Sports

Organized sports first originated all the way back in ancient Greece. Except in Sparta, no women were actually allowed to participate, and if a woman even made an attempt to sneak into the Olympic stadium and watch the events, it carried the death penalty. In Rome Empire, it was men who fought as gladiators, and then *centuries* had to pass before during imperial times, they were *then* joined by a few women in the arena.

Later when organized sports were revived during the middle of the 19th century, men again took the lead and blazed the trail. When the first 'modern' Olympic Games were held in 1896, there were no women who took part in it. This later changed in 1900, and then they competed in sports like tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrian events, and golf. Sports for them kept expanding as time went on and eventually included women‚Äôs wrestling, rugby and boxing which became Olympic sports in 2004, 2006 and 2012. Today we even have female racing drivers.

4. Smoking

Smoking tobacco was invented in the Americas. In the 16th and 17th centuries it was taken up by European conquerors. Until roughly 1900, there were then a few women took up what was openly and explicitly called ‚Äúthe filthy habit‚Äù, but previously it remained virtually an exclusively male activity. It was during the 1920s that women for some dumb ass reason, started smoking as way to advertise their ‚Äúindependence,‚Äù and intention to live the way that men did. Then in 1987, lung cancer emerged as women‚Äôs *number one!* (Murica') killer cancer. Great strides for liberations, you morons.

5. Cycling

As with the previous categories already, bicycles were invented and ridden by men. Should be a surprise there, because the earliest ones didn't having inflatable tires, and they were known as ‚Äúbone shakers.‚Äù Because they had huge front wheels that turned around slowly, were also very dangerous. It was only after the introduction of ‚Äúsafety bicycles‚Äù around 1900 or so, did any number of women being to use bikes as a form of transportation, which until then had been reserved almost exclusively for men, for completely understandable reasons.

6. Driving

Again. Men invented automobiles just like they did with bicycles. And we were also the first to drive them. And it wasn't because of ‚Äúmale chauvinism,"" there was a good reason for this. The early automobiles were modeled on coaches, and the coachmen had to sit outside (on the bock) so that way they could manage the horses that were in the front. So sitting outside they were exposed to the weather (as well as to dust) which naturally meant that most of the drivers had to wear goggles. It was only when later automobiles were enclosed and provided more comfort and accommodations that women then started driving them.

7. Flying

The earliest aircraft highly dangerous, and a lot of men who flew them were either killed or injured. That was probably one reason why women only started piloting them *much* later than men did. All the way up to today, more than a century after the Wrights‚Äô brothers first flight, it's only about 5% of American pilots that are female (the country with the highest percentage at 13% is India). 
So yet again, we see the paradox that women‚Äôs only way to ‚Äúprove themselves‚Äù is to start doing what men have been doing for so long.

8. Computing

The first examples we really have are with people like Pascal and Leibnitz in the 17th century with mechanical computing, and it's been as exclusive a men‚Äôs club as anyone could've expected it to be. Even the achievements of [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) have been *vastly* exaggerated (her real contribution was translating, and adding notes to a paper by a Piedmontese military engineer, Luigi Meabrea, on Charles Babbage‚Äôs calculating engine). More broadly speaking, it was only after decades of male rule that went almost entirely undisputed that women in their attempt to draw level with men, *then* took up computer work.

Even today women are underrepresented in high-tech fields in the U.S., being as the world‚Äôs number one high-tech country, their percentage in the field has actually been declining for a number of years.

9. War

Perhaps the most obvious. On good biological grounds, no society that hasn't lost it's mind has recognized that it can afford to lose large numbers of women.

War has always been an overwhelmingly male activity. It was only in the 1970's that the armed forces really began admitting any number of women, and only from about 2000 and onward, that they were allowed into some combat units. 

Ending Conclusion

From beginning to end all the way down the line, the dumb quest for gender equality has practically *always* been a one-way direction. There are almost no points in history where men have strived to be the equals of women. It always it was women lagging behind who sought to draw level with men.

Even to the point of trying to play in men‚Äôs ‚Äúballfield‚Äù (to quote crazy bitch, Betty Friedan) and achieve men‚Äôs ‚Äúpotency‚Äù (courtesy other crazy bitch, Jean Sinoda Bohlen). It's even been taken to the point of holding in high regard images showing things growing out of women‚Äôs groins (courtesy of ugly wench Naomi Wolf). Even when it comes at the cost of their own health (as already pointed out with with smoking, which in many countries is expanding faster among women than among men0. Even when it comes at the cost of sustaining far more injuries than men (as is the case in combat training). Even at the cost of greatly reduced fertility (which in many developed countries has now fallen well below replacement levels).

It's women who in their efforts to catch up, are waging war against their own genes, chasing after meaningless penis envy because they can't stand what they are, and to no avail. Whenever women draw level in one field, men always seem to respond and react by inventing another that people of both sexes perceive as more important and more progressive.",21,1
Collected Advice For 1% Male .‚Ä¢*,[removed],2,1
"""Everyone is too accessible"" - The harsh reality of the dating market for women","Prior to me stumbling on the weird part of the internet called ""Reddit"", I was just a regular youngin livin' life and enjoyin' the dating scene. I didn't question anything really, I just sat back and observed and used what worked. 

""Oh....she didn't get mad when he called her a bitch. In fact, she laughed. Interesting. *takes notes.*"" 

""This guy is great at negging. I gotta be like that - *takes notes*"" 

""When you play fight with a bitch it's basically foreplay. *Takes notes*"" 

You get the idea. Whenever I saw something that worked I stashed it away in my memory bank and would use it at my leisure while calibrating it all to my personality. 

When it came to dating I just did whatever I felt like doing. 

LTR? Sure why not.

Cheat? Yep, I've cheated on all of my exes. Don't give a fuck.

I'd cheat on them, we'd have a ""falling out"", and then we'd fuck because I thought you were supposed to fuck your exes before you get more pussy. It's not like you're supposed to catch feelings or care (although I am incapable of such things but that's another convo) point is that you are doing it out of familiarity and sexual chemistry. You two both know what you like already. 

Overall I was just living my best life, not caring much about the ""state"" of the Dating Market, my Sexual Market Value, etc, etc. I never had to ""looksmaxx"" or any weirdo shit like that. I look decent enough to put my foot in the door at best, and the rest was just pure game. 

Then, after a day of sex with one of my exes, shit changed. She was wondering why it was so hard to find a decent guy to date, and then digressed to how our relationship ended because I cheated on her and then promptly dumped her. 

That's when she hit me with one line. 

""Everyone is too accessible."" 

At the time I had no idea as to why that line bothered me so much. I hit her with that ""what the fuck is that supposed to mean"" look.  

She pretty much explained that it's far too easy for a guy to find a hoe to fuck be it online or otherwise. So there's no loyalty. 

I just thought for a second and brushed off what she said, then changed the subject. I shrugged my shoulders but what she said lingered in my mind for days. And then weeks. Why the fuck was this bothering me so much? 

It was like an innate ""sting."" And I only feel that way when I am face to face with a hypocrite (call it intuition). Nothing repulses me more than hypocrisy, so there was an innate subtext to her statement that even she had not picked up on but I did. 

During my search I stumbled on Reddit, then The Red Pill. I read the sidebar, and it was some real shit. Most of it were things that I had known innately, but it was a dope ass read. Still, I didn't quite find the answer that I was looking for. 

Then finally, a line from a poster over in PurplePill damn near gave me a paradigm shift. 

""Women are having a hard time accepting the new realities of this new dating system, ***even when they are one of the primary beneficiaries of the dating market.***"" 

That was it. That was the ""sting"" I felt. The hypocrisy, solipsism, etc, etc. 

The very same bitch that was able to enjoy ONS, FWBs, and flings when it was convenient for her, AND cheat on her LTRs (yes she did it multiple times) by calling me up to go fuck her (or by me calling her up), had the audacity to turn around and say that, ""Everyone is too accessible."" Because \*I\* had the means to cheat on her? 

Shit, it was all one big brain blast for me. But once you swallow that Red Pill you become obsessed with patterns and shit. 

I thought back to another one of my exes when we had some pillow talk months ago. We've known each other for a long time, and we dated on and off twice (I cheated the first time and broke it off, second time I just got tired of her and dumped her). 

We reminisced back to when we were in the ""talking"" stage of dating shortly after we first met. Back then it was just us going out for drinks, a movie, or over to each other's places to fuck. She admitted that she legitimately wasn't seeing anyone else during that time. 

I just said matter-of-factly ""Ohhh, well this is awkward, but you were one of three."" 

You should have seen the look on her face. ***It was the same look she gave me when I told her that I cheated on her.*** 

""Oh, I didn't know that you were that type of guy....""

At the time I found that statement funny, and now I know why. The same kind of bitch that ain't mind going on multiple dates when it came to other dudes, have a few flings and ONS, is judging me for 'multidating' with her before we were even official? 

So I asked myself why? 

Then during some study time (read: meditative porn time) it hit me like an epiphany. 

Casual sex and the dating market is only seen as bad ***when it is the reason why they can't lock down the man that they want.***

So they blame tinder hoes, thots, 'Pick-me' bitches, etc, etc, because if they didn't exist then the man that they desired wouldn't have strayed or had more options to explore away from her. 

In their mind, every guy up until the 'LTR-material' guy was simply a ""learning"" experience. Now she's ready for the ""real"" thing. But there are two things that they don't consider. 

1) He has other (better) options

and more importantly.....

2) He doesn't see her as anything more than what she saw the last guys as - something fun to do

You see, when bitches talk about the guys that came before (and during pillow talk they love going down memory lane) there are men who they just didn't care much for. Hell, even ex-husbands are treated that way. Of course, she still fucked all of those men, but they didn't mean anything and what's more, ""they just happened to be there."" 

So when the shoe is on the other foot, and she herself ""just happened to be there"" for a guy that they caught feelings for, *they cannot handle it*. 

And we have a term for what these women end up as..... 

Alpha Widows. 

Hell, that shit reminded me of a Trey Songz lyric in his song Love Lost 

""When the one you need, don't need you. What do you do?"" 

And the sad truth is....

***They don't know what to do*** 

And that is, the harsh reality. And why now I went from indifference, to a small little twinge of pity for a lot of bitches during these sexually liberated times. 

The very same market that allowed them to explore their sexuality, is the same one that also allowed the men that they wanted to lock down to do the same. Thus, it's a gamble to see if the man that they caught feelings for actually likes them, is just fucking them, or will eventually come across a better option and throw them in the trash bin. 

***So, essentially, they hate being put in the same position that a lot of men are put in when it comes to dating women - the one with more to lose.*** 

What's the point of it all then? 

It goes back to what one of my OGs told me about street life and just life in general. 

***""There's no rules to this shit.""*** 

Act accordingly.",226,1

The worst decision I have made in younger years,[removed],2,1
My year so far after discovering TRP,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Back around march/June I discovered TRP for the 2nd time in my life. I guess when I was around 18/19 I wasn't ready for this information yet, as I labeled it as ""bullshit"", no way these strangers on the internet know how to be better in life than I do (yeah, very autistic). I'm 22 now and my life has drastically improved these last few months, sometimes I'm too scared that I'll fall back. Let's begin with how I was doing pre-TRP:

&amp;#x200B;

Weight: 65KG Skinnyfat, 178 CM Tall, 22 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

Lifts: Girl weights. Literally.

&amp;#x200B;

DL: 60KG 1x5

&amp;#x200B;

Squat: Empty bar

&amp;#x200B;

Bench: Empty bar

&amp;#x200B;

BB Row: Empty bar

&amp;#x200B;

OHP: Empty bar

&amp;#x200B;

Diet: No diet, ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. Barely drank water. 

Anxious as fuck, victim's mentality, smoked weed, almost got 6 months of delay on my bachelor's (blamed corona for not being able to find internship). Pussy with girls. Jacked off from time to time , my libido was so low that I didn't even have the desire to jack off. throw depressed somewhere in there too. Only went to get a cut every 2-3 weeks, looked like a mess time to time. Live with my parents.

&amp;#x200B;

Now first of all: improvement. I started to read every bit of the sidebar (not everything exactly), but let's say the most important stuff, and the TRP handbook pdf, and watched almost every of AMSes videos. It helped me, but I didn't feel confident enough. 2 things that stuck with me the most and I didn't do 1 thing: LIFT. Started lifting, google'd every bit about lifting and diet, and got a subscription. First month my diet still sucked, but I started learning more and more.  Slowly but surely my lifts were going up, and this is where I stand now after ¬±4 months of serious training:

&amp;#x200B;

Weight: 71KG, height 178cm, 22y old

1RM's:

&amp;#x200B;

DL: 97,5KG

&amp;#x200B;

Squats: 85KG

&amp;#x200B;

Bench: 60 KG

&amp;#x200B;

BB row: 60 KG

&amp;#x200B;

OHP: 40KG

&amp;#x200B;

Diet: Barely any sugar, only water all day, high macro food(proteine/fats/carbs), supplements: proteine powder, vitamin D, zinc, magnesium, omega 3.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a buzz cut with a nice fade, which really gave me a lot of confidence. I disgusted the look at first, but as I was lifting and put on some weight, I actually really started to like it, only thing is in order to look fresh, you'd have to get a cut every week. Next to this my anxiety started to fade away, no depression anymore, high libido, 3 dates, 1 of I've had sex with(still insecure on that part, but I'll keep going strong), found a great internship and cut out porn/jacking off (sometimes I've relapsed though). Wrote down goals for the future, and wanted to move out my parents place, but it's not a smart thing to do as we're in a pretty heavy lockdown. 

&amp;#x200B;

All within a timeframe of ¬±6 months. It's very scary how insanely hard you can change yourself, my first post was me ranting about my life, and that I wanted to change. Now about half a year later I can proudly reflect on myself again and see the progress. I'm looking forward to post my next reflection wether it's good or bad, it's something that keeps me on the TRP path. As David Goggins says: STAY HARD!",24,1

Break Up With Your Country,"I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Most of you know this at an innate level. Some of you have a suspicion. Some are deluded bloopies and will never figure it out, even when you have your face rubbed into it. **Your country hates you and it's time for you to leave.**

Let's break down that last statement piece by piece, so there is absolutely zero ambiguity. *Your Country* which is to say the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. *Hates*, does everything in its power to make your life worse. *You*, the primary demographic of the red pill is Caucasian at 60% followed by Asians and Indians at 15% percent respectively.

At every important stage of your life the policies of the government, as well as the cultural institutions of the media and (un)education system have actively intervened to make your life worse. These people spend billions of dollars a year actively making your life worse and thinking of new ways to make it even worse than before. They have special programs dedicated to teaching women to be unattractive shrews, creating a shortage of women and a more competitive sexual market. They print money to devalue the money you already made. They have special programs designed to fuck you out of a job or promotion in favor of people who are far less qualified and capable. Public spaces are [deliberately desecrated](https://www.great-replacement.com/images/2018/tess-holliday-cosmopolitan-magazine.png) with ugliness making them unpleasant and depressing to be in. Your government goes out of its way to import people from countries where ""being an edgelord"" means stabbing people in a blood feud and not internet trolling.

The point is that you live in a place that's designed by people who openly hate you, which is to say a prison. You live in an open-air prison and you read the Red Pill in a desperate attempt to find prison coping strategies aka ""Enjoy The Decline"". Your parents and grandparents didn't have to do any of this because they lived easier lives in their 20s than you do right now, which is why they don't understand any of it.

Let's take a step back. Have you ever noticed all of the motivational posts on the Red Pill? That's basically the only thing written here anymore. Why? Because people under government mandated house arrest need to be persuaded not to rub false happiness out of their penises or kill themselves outright. Stoicism is really popular right now, just as it was during the fall of the Roman Empire when barbarians were looting and raping with a careless abandon. Happy people living in healthy societies don't need to read motivational articles multiple times a week. 

Or maybe we should go a bit further and ask a more fundamental question: Why is there demand for sexual strategy in first world countries in the current year? Your ancestors didn't need to read tomes of alpha male strategies, and the second and third world seem to be getting along just fine without them. Are you one of the rare non-retards here, capable of thinking past his own penis and contemplating the bigger picture?

This is the [American party scene in the 80's](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D1lmm8qUwAEHmn-.jpg) and this is [more or less what you can expect today ](https://dailytrojan.com/2019/03/28/what-a-usc-student-looks-like/). Healthy societies produce attractive women. Today the United States is no longer healthy which is why it produces fats, goblins and genderless entities while forcing you to subsidize the university degradation department with your engineering degree. If there wasn't a chronic shortage of sexually viable women there would be no need for sexual strategy, and you could ""just be yourself"" like your grandfather did. Problem solved.

What's fascinating is that the Red Pill is fond of the phrase ""Sexual Marketplace,"" yet for some strange reason is completely ignorant of the laws of supply and demand as applied to
sex. Specifically, the sexual demand for men is decreasing because the supply of women who are obese and drink down their SSRIs with box wine is increasing. Thanks government and big business! GayLubeOil must be a divinely inspired Hyperborean Ultra Genius for being the first person in the history of The Red Pill to apply [Arbitrage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) to the sexual marketplace. What I'm telling you in the clearest, simplest language I can muster is: Put down your favorite book: Jorgen Coperson's 12 Rules of Coping in Copenhagen and use all of your time to figure out how to get location independent income and a residency permit, so you can live in [a place that makes you happy and still has fertile women.](https://www.croatiawise.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/zrce-beach-featured-image.jpg). If you want to improve your life you have to make some big changes, and leaving your country is one of the biggest ones you can make.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware that my comments are going to be filled by crying Untermenschen upset that I waterboarded them with concentrated Red Pills. Your tears fill me with joy. I've already left the degenerate shitheap that is the West. My quality of living is through the roof. My cost of living is ‚Öì of what it was previously. I don't wear a stupid mask and I'm not in a lockdown. The women are hotter. The gyms are open. The food is better. I know my advice is good because I'm living it right now. Oh and I'm also pulling out my programmer and analysts because I can't have them sharing a FEMA camp cell with you in 5 years.

This brings me to my riveting conclusion. Obviously 90% of the Red Pill community are slaves who never want to get off the plantation. On some self-flagellatory level, we need to realize that some people are actually enjoying these [insane restrictions](https://youtu.be/XR98A70tbaA) as they have a leveling effect.  Women and feminized men are particularly prone to hysteria, and feel a rush of satisfaction from being controlled by someone else. **My point is simple: get the fuck out while you still can.** Or don't listen to me and waste your youth in a bleak 1984 no fun allowed hellscape jerking yourself off in front of a monitor alternating between Riley Reid and David Goggins. This is all slavery training for the new glorious era of post-capitalist humanism, where you will live in a tiny room in a high-rise building, with a computer chip in your hand that your weekly allowance of credits is transferred to. Enjoy the Decline.

2020 Year in review. Traveling the world and covid.,"I was inspired by the other year in review to do my own. 

Exactly one year ago I was on a beach in Colombia enjoying my thanksgiving on vacation. For my thanksgiving dinner I had the finest Colombian coca on the finest pair of Colombian tits. I was only in Colombia for a week, but I slept with 3 women while I was there. 

(#, place we met, #/10) (1 being ugly, 5 being average, 10 being drop dead gorgeous.) 

1. Club, 7. She was cute with a tight body. We were making out in the club before I took her back to my hotel. 

2. Tinder, 6. She had a great body, slim waist, big ass and tits. I took her to a private beach where we fucked and swam for hours. I still talk to her occasionally. 

3. Tinder, 5. We matched on tinder and met at a bar for my last night there. We were salsa dancing and flirting for a few hours before I took her back to my hotel. 

Overall this was a great experience. I don‚Äôt speak much Spanish so communication was a constant issue, but I learned that talking isn‚Äôt as important as body language and touch, also how nice google translate is. 

I went back home to finish my final semester of college. I went out with a bang. 

4. Tinder, 6. Curvy with a fat ass. We banged on the second date. Then we became FWB for 6+ months before she moved out of state. Great in bed and a fun person to hangout with. We still talk occasionally. 

5. Bar, 7. A young red head with a great body. Met at a bar and started flirting right away. Took her home after some drinks and We had sex multiple times throughout the night and morning. I hit her up once more but no response

6. Tinder, 7.  A cute blonde with a good body. Came over for some wine after a few messages on tinder. Her clothes were coming off after about 15 minutes of talking. 

7. Party, 7. Threw a big graduation party with my roommates. Hooked up with one of their friends at the party. She was fine black woman with an amazing athletic body, she was a personal trainer. Only hooked up once. 

After graduation I Went home to my parents for the holidays. I went to Las Vegas with some friends for New Years and had a blast. After Vegas I booked a one way flight to London. I planned to backpack across Europe for 3 months before starting work. 

I started in London where I made many friends at my hostel and planned my trip for the coming months. I went to a few bars and one club, I made out with a few girls but nothing further. I was only in London for 3 days which was my average for each city I visited. 

Next stop was Barcelona. 

8. Hostel, 4. I met a young curvy lady from Panama at the hostel and went to a club with her and friends from the hostel. We went back early and fucked in the hostel showers. Nothing special but a fun night. 

9. Club, 8. Met a beautiful Spanish MILF with a great body in a club on my last night. We hit it off instantly and danced for hours. She doesn‚Äôt speak English but her friend helps translate for us. I convince her friend to let her come back with me. We fuck for hours, she was a freak and we even did anal. I didn‚Äôt find out she was a milf until the next day when I got her Instagram. We still dm on insta occasionally. 

Next stop was Paris. Flirted with many girls at the hostel and went to one club. Made out with a beautiful French girl but when I asked her to come back with me she declined. The next night I made out with a beautiful blonde Argentinian at the hostel but she says she‚Äôs on her period so we don‚Äôt go further. No lays but many fun experiences. 

Amsterdam is next. I meet up with a Dutch friend I made in Australia (She‚Äôs the Dutch goddess from my gone wild story). 

10. Festival, 8. A beautiful Dutch girl with great tits and a bubbly personality. We smoked good weed and had lots of sex for a few days. 

Copenhagen is next. I went on one pub crawl and met a beautiful Australian. We made out but nothing further. Then I go to Berlin. Went out to a club and made out with a few women but nothing more. Next is Prague. I visit a friend studying abroad there and we went to a few bars and clubs. I hooked up with another American studying abroad there. 

11. Bar, 7. A cute girl from California with a good tight body. We meet at a bar and flirt and drink for a few hours. She tells me she has a boyfriend but I ignore it. We end the night at her place.  

Next stop is Vienna. I make friends at the hostel bar and flirt with many girls there. I make out with a new girl every night but only sleep with one. 

12. Bar, 5. A thick Australian with giant tits. We meet at the bar and flirt right away. After a few drinks we go fuck in the hostel bathroom. 

Budapest, my favorite city is next. I made a lot of friends at the hostel and slept with 4 woman and make out with many more over the week I‚Äôm there. Very fun party city. 

13. Club, 6. A cute French girl with a curvy yet tight body. Start dancing with her in the club. We get a few drinks and then go back to my hostel and fuck in the bunk bed. We have sex a few times that night then part ways in the morning.

15. Hostel, 8. A beautiful blonde Dutch woman with cool thigh tattoos. We go to a bar with hostel friends. She ask me to join her in the shower at the end of the night. I happily oblige and fuck her senseless in the shower. I plan to visit her in Amsterdam at the end of my trip in March but then covid happened. 

16. Hostel, 9. A beautiful red headed Australian with blue eyes and perfect body. She was one of the hostel staff (they were all 20 something travelers) and by far the most gorgeous. She gives me a tour of the city and we flirt the whole time. That night we go to a bar and we‚Äôre in a make out circle with the hostel staff. We fuck that night and three more times throughout the week. I take her out to dinner for Valentine‚Äôs Day and we go see a great DJ that night. By far my favorite Valentine‚Äôs Day ever. We talked a little after I left but nothing more happened. 

After wild Budapest I went to a few towns in Croatia to hike and relax. Then I went to Italy. I stop in Venice first for the carnival festival. I make out with a few girls but nothing more. Then I go to Florence. A few make outs at bars but nothing more. Next stop is Naples. I only stay for 2 days since covid hits Italy but both nights I sleep with a girl at the hostel. 

17. Hostel, 5. A week thick Latina from Venezuela. We meet at he hosts and go to a bar with friends from the hostel. At the end of the night we fuck in my bed. She gave me the best head I‚Äôve ever gotten. We fuck again in the morning but then she leaves. 

18. Hostel, 7. A cute German girl with a tight body. We flirt while playing drinking games with friends from the hostel. We fuck in the bathroom. 

After Naples I go to Nice, France to meet up with my FWB #4 for her spring break. We spend a few days in nice then go to Switzerland for a week. We fuck everyday and it gets better every time. She even cooks me breakfast every morning. At the end is when covid started spreading in Europe so we both had to book flights home early. 

I get back home and stay with my parents a few weeks to quarantine. Then I go back to my college town to pack up and move for work. However because of covid they push my start date back a month. I decide to stay in my college town with my old roommates and sleep on the couch until I can start work. My start date keeps getting pushed back but I don‚Äôt mind. I‚Äôm having fun with my college friends. I sleep with my FWB many more times until she moves. I go on many dates with girls from tinder, bumble, and hinge. 

19. Tinder, 5.  Cute girl with an average body. We go on one date and have sex that night. We fuck a few more times but she started catching feelings so I cut it off. 

20. Party, 6. Cute girl with a fat ass. I met her a year ago when I had a foursome with her and a friend, but hadn‚Äôt talked since. Meet her at party and hook up that night. We become FWB and end up having a threesome. 

21. Bumble, 7. Cute black woman with big tits and a tight body. Match on bumble and go get drinks. Sleep together that night and become FWB for a few weeks before I leave. She‚Äôs a freak and we Have a threesome with the girl above. 

22. Party, 7. Cute girl with a nice body. I get her number at a party but she says she has a boyfriend. After a few weeks she texts me saying she‚Äôs single. We go one one date to the river for a swim. We come back to my place and fuck in the shower. 

23. Tinder, 7. Thick redhead with amazing tits and a fat ass. Match on tinder and go float on the river and have a few drinks. We shower together at her place and fuck that night. lots of LMR but I powered through by being patient.  We hangout once more but don‚Äôt hookup again.

24. Tinder, 6. Cute blonde with a nice, tight body. We match, I go over to her place for drinks after a few messages. We play drinking games and have some wild sex. 

25. Hinge, 8. Beautiful red head with a tight petit body. We go to a brewery for our first date. We go out with friends for a second date and we go back to her place after. Sex was alright, nothing special. She ghosted me soon after, and got back with her ex. 

26. Tinder, 5. Cute brunette with a curvy body. I go to her place to watch a movie. I finish in her mouth by the end of the movie. 

I move back home with my parents to find a new job. I Finally got a job after a few months but Im living with my parents until I save up. They‚Äôre laid back so it‚Äôs not too bad. Dating apps are now basically my only option since covid. I‚Äôve gone on a few dates, one hookup, one relationship. 

27. Tinder, 5. Curvy Asian girl with a fat ass. We go to a Mexican restaurant for margaritas and fajitas. 

28. Hinge, 8. Beautiful blonde with a fantastic body. Met on hinge and went to a park for our first date. We go on a few more dates before we sleep together. We party with her friends. I take her as my date to my buddy‚Äôs wedding. We keep hooking up and going on dates. The sex is amazing. After a few months we‚Äôre in a relationship. 

**‚ÄúConclusion:‚Äù
This year has had a lot of ups and downs. I‚Äôve learned a lot through my travels. 

It‚Äôs not about the places you go, but the people you meet. 

I hooked up with women that didn‚Äôt speak the same language as me. That has showed me how important body language and physicality is. 

Having a good time should be your top goal when you go out. Hit the dance floor, laugh with your friends, flirt with whoever you want. You‚Äôll attract people looking for fun. 

Sometimes all it took was 2 messages to get a girl over for a drink or movie and into bed. 

The best way to eliminate LMR is by building comfort. 

One night stands can be some of your best sexual experiences but also unfulfilling.

Having a connection with someone; whether it be a friend or lover, short term or long term; is the most rewarding. 

I‚Äôm not sure what next year brings, but 2020 has been a year I‚Äôll never forget.",3,1

2019-2020 A Year in Review,"As this infamous year comes to a close I want to reflect back on the game lessons I learned over the past 12 months. I'll talk about the notches I got pre and during the pandemic, some lessons and insights learned and random factoids.



From Nov '19 to Nov '20 I picked up 15-17 new notches. Five of these were while at a large law enforcement academy in the US. I'll give brief descriptions below:



S. 5/10, 3-letter intel agency police officer. Met on Hinge, same night lay and fuck buddies until her training ended and she left. Average white girl.



A. 7/10 intel analyst for large law enforcement agency. Met on Bumble, BJ in my car on first date and 2nd date close before she ghosted me. She was batshit crazy.



T. 6/10 customs officer and bikini competitor but chunky and batshit crazy. Met via cold approach during academy and closed over Thanksgiving break, on 2nd date.


M. 5/10 environmental engineer, met on Hinge. same night lay and fuck buddy for a few months. Extremely into BDSM



D. 5/10 Indian-American TSA officer. same night lay. also crazy. put my car into neutral while I was driving us on the highway. Smelled bad and was very hairy. 18 years old



C. 7/10 bikini competitor, took 3 dates to lay but insane body and great sex. Dated semi-seriously for 6 months. Met on Hinge.



A. 4/10 Mexican mother of 2 and accountant. Looked like your typical hotel housekeeper. Terrible sex. Met on Hinge



J. 5/10 local city police officer. overweight Mexican with huge tits. Still a plate to this day. Met on Tinder



H. 6/10 blonde engineer with a thick ass. Met on Bumble and were FWB until she fell off. Great sex



Y. 5/10 Mexican MILF. same day lay, dated for a couple of weeks until she got way too clingy. Plus her body and sexy was bad.



H. 7/10 skinny white girl with HUGE natural tits. Met on Hinge. FWB going on 6+ months now. great sex and cooks for me



S. 6/10 thick Filipina air traffic controller. Great sex on the first date. Ghosted me after 2nd or 3rd date.



Y. 6.5/10 Mexican mom of one. Athletic body, good sex but she caught feelings strong and had emotional meltdowns on me. Met via cold messaging on Facebook



D. 5/10 thick white girl with a tattoo of a girl in leather bound up with a gag in her mouth. obviously same night lay and fuck buddy for a few weeks before she had a meltdown on me and called me mysogynist.



B. 6/10 Israeli powerlifter, my Israeli flag. Good sex on the 2nd date but she ghosted after.



M. 7/10 Mexican artist. Sex on 2nd date and one of the best, tightest bodies and best sex of the year. FWB for a while but I think she's ghosted me as of now.



M. 6.5/10 air force girl. easy sex on the first date, a little heavier than I prefer. we've been dating semi-seriously for a couple of months



M. 7/10 tall blonde with almost a perfect body. She loses points for saggy breasts due to breastfeeding and a busted face from prior meth use. Its amazing how drugs can age a girl so badly.



Lessons Learned



-At a certain point you must not ask questions for every stupid thing on TRP. Meaning, stop being a learner and start being a teacher yourself. Don't post questions on AskTRP, but instead read other posters questions and think what you would do in that situation.



Start to use your brain proactively instead of seeking the counsel and approval of other men. Sometimes you'll make the wrong move, but it's better to err on the side of being bold and thinking independently. You need to take the training wheels off eventually.



-The pandemic has not put a dent in game at all. If anything I have saved tons of money by not buying drinks at bars like I used to. Fresh-direct to the crib has never been easier. My other clutch first date is a picnic in the park. Although it's too cold now to use that, it served me well over the spring and summer.



-Of the girls listed, literally only 2 insisted on a condom. That's pretty ghastly










-Some girls will fall off if you don't ping them via text, dates etc. They're still into you but they won't make the first move. Don't be afraid to stay on top of your plates.



-No surprise here but clearly girls date up, or at their level. I consider myself a 7/10 but make good money, cool car, good game etc. I didn't get any notches above a 7/10. But if a girl is a 7 and you're also a 7, you can increase perceived (or real) SMV by amping up your cocky funny attitude and teasing her.



-The more confident a girl is, the more teasing she will enjoy and be able to handle.



-I'll take a 5/10 who is great in bed over a 7/10 who isn't



-The number one way to get found out with other girls is by them finding stray hairs in your crib/car. Be diligent about vacuuming and cleaning your place. Girls will leave long strands of hair in your bathroom trash can, in the shower, sink and especially around her side of the bed if she sleeps over. 



You can see stray hairs a lot easier in the dark with a flashlight then during the bright of day. 



-Girls can handle HARD choking. Prior to this year I was choking girls during sex at about 50% strength. One girl told me to go harder and I've been going almost 100% strength with all girls and they all love it. I'm afraid they're going to pass out some day but several have mentioned how they would find that very hot. Girls are fucking crazy.



So that's it. I've given you all some brief descriptions of the notches gained and lessons learned from a low-key, intermediate player in a third tier American city before and during a global pandemic.



I strongly urge beginners to make similar reflections back periodically on their notches and what they've learned in terms of game. Always be looking for new ways to look at game and success, and stop asking so many questions.

Settling down with a religious woman,"We know women practice hypergamy but some make the mistake to assume that if you get a post wall woman you are safe. This is bullshit because there will always be someone with higher perceived value that will be willing to simp for your girl. All we can do is work on ourselves but this leaves the rest to chance which is too risky imo when wanting to settle down and start a family. (Perhaps in my 50s)

For the meantime I'm content to spin plates but I would never LTR a plate because of the lack of self respect a woman has to allow herself to be a plate. when I want to settle down I will start going to church, I don't really agree with any religion as a whole but there are parts I like about each.

I've decided I will join a Muslim church because knowing how men are I wouldn't want the mother of my kids walking around flaunting her body. The very thought disgusts me and fills me with anger, if a woman is still talking/putting herself in the presence of other men while she is with you that is equivalent to cheating, she is keeping her options open and hoping someone better comes along.

The mother of my kids will wear a full burkha whenever in public, this is the only true way to stop hypergamy as it prevents a woman from seducing and a man from being seduced. Feel free to try and convince me otherwise in the comments. If she is truly loyal to me what is the use of revealing her body in public? And if the answer is attention and validation that is also cheating because it's as if to say the validation and attention from me is not enough.",53,1

How do I continue forward when I'm just less than a perfect guy in female's fantasy?," 

I'm 18M and I'm going to go to college soon. I'm deathly scared of being a lonely virgin by the age of thirty. I'm only 5'6.5 inches tall, I have a dark skin typical of southeast asians so I look the opposite of Kpop stars, and my penis is only 4.5 inch erect max. Basically, I'm no women's fantasy. I'm never the first choice they think of, if at all.

Right now, I've dropped from 100kg to 80kg over the previous year, which made me a bit more confident but it's still not enough. My goal is 60kg with 14% body fat. I also have Asperger, which is a high functioning autism. It's not obvious like the full-blown autistic kid but it's definitely noticeable if you get to know me. However, these are the things I think I could fix, or at least try to hide it better (my autism). Though, if I improved my style and lost my weight and buffed up, I feel like the social awkwardness born out of my asperger is going to be the last semi fixable peg that will be standing

What could I have done to make my situation better. I feel like my online option is to be some post wall women's wallet once she's done fucking the actual desirable men. I really don't want to be alone and left undesired",32,1
"Maybe you are wrong about ""All Women""","  

Hallo RedPillers

I wanna share my experience about my first relationship, that will contrast everything you are taught about women.

So

I was a loner/looser for 18 years. No social life and little to no experience with women until the first year of university, where I met Her. A solid 9, tall, curvy ,blonde, big tits, blue eyes, smart as fuck, social, pretty but in a long distance relationship beauty. She likes me and after her brake up, we start having sex. Despite my lack of experience, I learn fast and we are fuck buddies for a couple of months before the summer holidays. I got oneitis, but who can blame me, an inexperienced, virgin before her, lost boy.

Midsummer, I call her, confess my feelings, she has too. I tell her ‚Äúok do whatever you want for the rest of the summer, we will meet back when the semester starts‚Äù. Big mistake from my side, cause I wanted to be in a relationship with her. 

She does not reply to messages, fucks another dude a few times and I am broken cause all I think about is her.

Either way, summer holidays end, we meet again and a few months later we get into a relationship. Things go seemingly well, she is getting seriously, deeply in love, but the latter part of summer broke me. I was depressed (I went to a psychiatrist, not self-diagnosed) and became the worst beta you can imagine, rock bottom. Jealousy, weakness, indecisiveness, mood swings, bitterness, complaining and all the beta characteristics you guys know well.

Did that 9, absolute sexbomb of a woman leave me?

Actually no. She could have, probably should have but she tried really hard to help me get over it, be with me and love me.

Things were going south in the March quarantine, and after a small time we spent apart she contacted me and told me she wants to try again. But I decided it was finally time for me to be alone, heal, and stop wasting both of our times.

You see, fellow pillers, not all women will leave you in time of weakness. There is true love out there, there are women who will fight with you/ for you in the times of need.

I know a part of redpill is to protect yourself from dangerous situations with women, but I do truly believe there are quality women out there, at least one for each one of you.

All opinions are welcome in the comments, thanks for reading.",57,1

"Winning is exploiting the system. Fuck em all, go for the win.","**Intro:**

I find that a large reason for young/new RP men failing to take the material provided here by some of the wisest men online and actually achieving, is due to them simply worrying about what the outside world will think of them. That bending some rules in their favor is ""beneath them"".

**Body:**

Listen here. The most successful people on tis planet (including Jeff Bezos' ex wife) do not give an utter fuck about how they achieve it. The entire world is simply many clearly defined systems and rules that all work together to limit you from going anywhere. Imagine a game of poker or black jack. Most people will say that it is just ""luck"" or that ""luck is the primary factor in the game"". This is bullshit and you know it. Just like poker, the world does not have luck, it has probability. Luck of the draw is simply a term that defines your starting point, everything else is how you play your cards. 

Unlike poker though, the rules of life can be argued, bent, and even broken! Do you seriously think the people in power didn't break every rule in the book to get their hands on the biggest scam in the world? (I am talking about the USD printing press here). Basically, this life is a maze built by people at the top to reduce competition from the bottom. Some people find the exist by wasting their entire life trying every single option. But guess what, thanks to RP, thanks to hundreds of books and billions of gigabytes of data online on finance, stocks, success, federal law, etc, you don't have to try every option.

This is why you are here correct? The reason you are still on this sub (and not taking action) is because you think that you can simply read and absorb this into your being some how. False.

Back to the maze example. Using the material out there, and here, you can increase your odds of success. This is what we are doing. By counting the cards, observing patterns, and trying what has already been proven to work, you can increase your odds of success an infinite number of times. In other words, climb the walls of the maze, and look to find where the finish is. Once you know the end goal (which TRP clearly outlines) you can take concrete steps towards it.

But we all know this. **Conclusion:**

You just still think that you aren't that kind of guy. You don't need to be savage. You don't need to embody the hunter you were born to be by evolution thousands of years ago. You can play it safe, play it cool, and play by the rules. Guess what, no one who wins, plays by the rules. We bend them to their limits. We go against the grain. The trick is to keep the rules from breaking in a way that gets you in prison.

There is no such thing as a dream job. A dream girl. An American dream. Because its a fucking dream. Pick the career that you know you are predisposed by biology to excel at. You are good at math? Be the top accountant of all time. Good at arguing? Be the top dog attorney that puts Harvey Spectre to shame. Oh you don't like law school? Take it like a man, do you want to win? The guy printing your money obviously does. We love to bash the guys on wall street for making dirty money by using YOUR money to make them money. Do you think they care?

Pick the cream of the crop girls. Oh she won't take the bait? Well maybe your bait is fucking shit and you're gonna need to take a few hundred L's and walk through some shit before your bait is any good. Elevate your odds of winning above the competition. That is they key to RP. This isn't a guaranteed win, this is a game plan, a strategy, a cheat code to make your life better, but you still need to beat the damn game cheat codes or not. Or you can quit.

Think about it. Do you think that someone like Jeff Bezos became rich because he had a brilliant idea? No. He simply crushed the competition, out sued the fucking government, walked on every mother fucker's head who was in his way. Alpha's are made not born. And they aren't made through some fair game.

To be the top dog of this world and the sexual market place, you are gonna need to be non-standard. Your approach is gonna have to stand out, be unique, and sometimes, you're gonna have to sideline some simp who isn't worth your time. Boo fucking Hoo. Stop getting so sentimental. Oh you had to drop a plate? Drop it like its hot. There are no strings attached in any of this shit. The only string out there is the one that is keeping you from dying and its gonna break sooner or later.",155,1

What I learned from being a simp,"

If you treat her like a celebrity she will treat you like a fan. All the girls I was treating like a celebrity the girls I was obsessed with constantly complimenting feeding her lots of attention doing what Disney and society told me to do to get a girl to like me and to how to treat them . these girls treated me like a fan. And didn‚Äôt give a fuck.

She don‚Äôt care about you. She‚Äôs just loves what you do for her. Girls don‚Äôt care about there simps. In the eyes of the girls I was simping for I was a low value beta male. If that girl youre simping for cared about you you wouldn‚Äôt be her simp she wouldn‚Äôt be playing you.  Your nothing but free attention and favors while she simps for another guy. She uses you for attention cause the guy she really wants doesn‚Äôt give it to her. You‚Äôre nothing but a emotional tampon and if you have a gf and your her simp she‚Äôs probably cheating on you. 

She‚Äôs for the streets 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of the same girls I simped for later on when I wasn‚Äôt there simp anymore. I saw there nudes and them  getting fucked by Lots of guys. The same guys they were complaining about they gave these guys play but not me. I saw lots of hoe shit. Some of these girls had simp boyfriends too  who they claimed to love too. But they were cheating on I saw there nudes get leaked by countless literally guys the guys who didn‚Äôt give a fuck about them. And we‚Äôre complaining about while I got nothing that is when I became redpill

Female nature.,"Pull this off of a youtube comments no credits to me.


About four years after my divorce I (43m) met a woman (40) and after a year of dating we started talking about marriage. She had a son who was 13 years old at the time. While having dinner after ring shopping one evening we started talking about her son's schooling and where we were going to live. I was still renting a house after my divorce but I wanted to purchase a nice new home for us. The following day she sends me a text saying she wasn't going to compromise on sending her son to a private Catholic high school which is the second most expensive school in our area ($11k a year). This woman made $32k a year before taxes at the time.

  I tried to have a conversation with her about how she was going to afford this school. She became irate during the texting conversation. I wasn't completely opposed to the school because I was raised Catholic and also attended a private Catholic high school. My issue was that after we started discussing marriage she was already making financial decisions on her own that were going to affect me. I thought that was completely wrong.

  The argument escalated to the point that I told her to come to my house (we lived separate) and get her shit. I was done arguing with her. Now she wants to talk about it. She comes over and I explain my viewpoint, and I tell her. What if for instance, a week before our wedding I show up with a new $125k Porsche? How would that make you feel knowing you were about to marry me and now WE had to pay for this expensive car loan? The light finally went off in her head.

  Guys, I'm sorry to tell you this, but many women won't love you. Not the way you want to be loved anyway. They are incapable of loving you the way you love them. They love the idea of the life they will have with you. There are good women out there but there are also a glut of vampires. When you are younger and find love you plan to build a life together. Once over 30 too many are looking for a fix for their failed life; an upgrade to the life they feel entitled to and one which they are not willing to work for themselves. 

To briefly wrap up this story we got back together. We got engaged and after she had the ring on her finger she thought she ‚Äúhad me‚Äù, she had won. She changed, our sex slowed down, she became argumentative during the house shopping and generally became irrational about where we were going to live and about the small wedding we were going to have. She had issues about the house purchasing and the wedding which made me realize this woman was in this relationship for what she could get out of it. I finally broke it off with her two weeks before the wedding because she hadn't seen me for the prior two weeks because she ‚Äúdidn't want to fight about the wedding.‚Äù 

These women are out there in vast numbers. They have an internal monologue that differs from how they act. They have a mask on and if you don't see through it you will pay an emotional and likely financial toll. Also in closing, through a twist of fate my ex-wife ended up working in the same building as my ex-fiance shortly after we separated Those two started talking. I need to mention that my ex-fiance lived with her parents. They had a large home and it just made financial sense for her to live with them. Anyway, my ex-wife sends me a photo of a text message where my ex-fiance tells her that I was just a means to an end. She wanted a house and I was getting us one. WTF right?


My takes.

Learn female nature and how they operate and you will naturally alpha.

If you want more of these post, let me know. You need to condition your mind, to truly become redpilled.",183,1

Comprehensive Guide to Modern Text Game Part 2: Building A High Value Instagram,"**Intro:**

Society sure moves fast‚Ä¶

Just 5 years ago, you could follow the Sidebar recommendations to only text for logistics and do just fine.

Focus on the interaction. Don‚Äôt worry about fancy text tricks.

Well, 5 years later, that information is out of date.

You can‚Äôt just text for logistics anymore for younger women. It doesn‚Äôt work.

If you don‚Äôt believe me, go ahead and try classic RedPill text-for-logistics text game on a Gen Z woman today. I guarantee you, you won‚Äôt be able to get her to go out with you even if you did everything right in the initial approach

So unless you want to be stuck banging 35 years or older women, you better make sure your text game is up to date and current with modern times.

One of the biggest ways to stand out from other guys with Gen-Z women is to show her you live a high value lifestyle and the best way to do that is to build a High Value Instagram.

**Body:**

The benefits of building a High Value Instagram are too numerous to mention in this post:

* You won't be going on wild goose chases with Gen-Z girls anymore, trying to get them to go out with you. If you have a sufficiently high value Instagram, flaking will be reduced to almost zero, as long as you build enough comfort through text game.
* You will even get chased by hot girls who DM you first. And all you have to do is set up a time to meet for the easiest fuck of your life.
* And last but not least, you don't have to look like an Old Boomer anymore when you flirt with a 20 year old girl and they ask for your Instagram but you don't have one so you have to say, ""I don't use social media""

Building a High Value Instagram takes time, just like getting a ripped body takes time.

There's really no shortcut to success. You can buy followers to supplement good fundamentals, similar to how you can use steroids to supplement good training &amp;amp; nutrition, but you can't really get anywhere if you ignore the fundamentals.

**And the Fundamentals of Building A High Value Instagram are as follows:**

**1) High Value Pictures Only**

I have no idea why but most guys just take pictures of their daily boring low value lives. Trust me, nobody gives a shit about your motivational quote for the day or about your picture of drinking coffee at Starbucks or your skinnyfat ass at the gym working out.

From now on, your Instagram should ONLY have high value pictures and nothing else. Delete all your old pictures of you hanging out with your average friends.

Delete your pictures of you with family members for Thanksgiving. They're useless.

So what kinds of pictures count as high value? There's basically 6 types of pictures that have been proven to convert women over and over again for me:

I will go in depth on how to get each type of picture later on in this guide.

**2) Work on yourself at the gym and lift until you at least look good in a T-shirt.** Sorry folks, hate to break it to you but no amount of filtering or picture manipulation will make you look good if you still have a skinny fat DYEL frame...

There's plenty of resources out there if you're struggling to build muscle but the most important things are to make sure you're getting at least 0.8g of protein per pound of body weight per day and to eat above maintenance if you're looking to build muscle, or eat below maintenance if you're looking to get shredded.

Stop trying to build muscle and lose fat at the same time, it's called spinning your wheels.

Either commit to a slow, gradual, lean bulk or commit to a cut. You can't have it both ways.

If you still can't build muscle even if you gave it an honest year of effort, it might be time to look into getting your hormone levels checked and hopping on a beginner Test cycle. Remember, if you can't look good in a T-Shirt, you will likely fail. So it's worth the risk.

**3) Get good at cold approach** \- This may seem contradictory but this is what sets you apart from the guys her age who are too immersed in their virtual worlds to take advantage of opportunities in real life. You will build a strong virtual presence 10 times faster if you incorporate cold approach than if you just naturally take pictures of your life.

If you're already doing cold approach, this is a game changer.

Oftentimes, you have amazing interactions with the girl, only to never see her again. This ensures that even if you never meet the girl again, your time wasn't wasted since she's actively contributing to your SMV through providing you with high value pictures.

Once you're done, if the interaction was any good, simply say, what's your Instagram and put your phone out for her to search for it. Then say, ""Sweet, let's take a picture together""

If she refuses, no need to try to overcome her objections, the vibe of the picture will be off anyways. Only take pictures with enthusiastic girls that are somewhat into you based on the interaction.

**How to get high value pictures:**

1. **Preselection** \- This is by far the most important type of picture to take as it is the most direct way to show other women you are fuckable. To do this, you will fill your Instagram with pictures of you standing next to hot girls. Most of these will come from Cold Approach. And don't give me any of that hover hands bullshit. Put your hand over her shoulder and snap a selfie of the two of you.
   1. One important thing to note is that you only take pictures with hot girls. Taking pictures with average or below girls won't help your value at all.
   2. Another super important thing, especially if you're a minority, is to pay attention to Race. If you're white, feel free to ignore this section. If you're black, make sure to only take pictures with black girls if that's what you're into or white girls if you're into other races. Black women view you as a race traitor if you go for other races, just the way it is.
   3. If you're Asian, Latino, or any other race, it is absolutely crucial that you only take pictures with HOT WHITE GIRLS. IT doesn't matter if you're only into Asian girls, you still only take pictures with white women because that's what gets you the most success with every other type of girl. No other races of women are allowed in your Instagram. This is because Asian or Latina women all know it's harder for a guy from their race to date white so not only will you do better with white girls, you will do better with your own race as well. Racism is alive and well in America, ignore this at your own peril.
2. **Wealth** \- It doesn't matter if you're not rich yet. It doesn't even matter if you don't give a shit about money and are more about saving the planet. Women are universally attracted to wealth, even the hipster types, it's just the way it is. How do you show wealth if you don't have it?
   1. Go to Ferrari dealerships and take pictures next to the car
   2. Whenever you see a cool building, something that looks like a fortune 500 CEO could work there, like a Bank or a Hotel lounge, ask someone to take a picture of you next to cool stuff. Make sure they snap at least 5 pics so you can choose the best ones
   3. Whenever you go out to eat at a nice restaurant, take a picture of the food and you next to the food. If you can't afford to do even that, take a picture of you standing right outside the restaurant.
   4. Remember, women are pretty simple minded when it comes to wealth stuff. They won't know about fancier or more authentic watch brands. They only care about Rolex. They won't know about your souped up custom built racing car, they only care about Ferrari.
   5. You don't have to go out of your way to get these. If you're going to eat at a fancy restaurant anyways, why not have it actually help your SMV instead of just costing money?
3. **Ripped Body** \- Do you look good naked? If not, it's time to cut. Doesn't matter if you can bench 275 lbs if you still look chubby all over. Better to have a skinny but shredded Brad Pitt fight club physique than be over 20% bodyfat. Just the way it is
   1. For pictures, it's best to get outdoors pictures with your shirt off instead of just random shirtless pictures in the bathroom mirror
   2. Shirtless pictures next to the beach are the best but if you can't get that, even shirtless pictures of you going for a run outside are good enough. Don't worry so much about the pictures, worry about getting the body
4. **Adventure** \- Women like risk takers. Don't ever take pictures of your Office and put it on your Instagram because that just screams beta bucks.
   1. Instead, only put up pictures of you going Skydiving, or Rockclimbing, or Jetskiing, snowboarding, combat sports, you get the picture
   2. You don't have to go out of your way to get these pictures, they should just naturally be acquired as you go to different places. If you're training boxing anyways, why wouldn't you take a picture for your Instagram?
5. **Leadership** \- Public speaking is the greatest display of leadership you can get. If you have videos of you talking with passion in front of a large crowd, put it up cuz it will generate leads like no tomorrow
   1. If not, feel free to join a local Toastmasters group. A lot of them are meeting virtually due to Covid but a few of them are still meeting in person. You need to go to the in person ones. Make sure you have someone in the audience recording you while you're speaking that also show the audience. Have your friend crouch down so they can capture the the audience and you speaking at the same time.
   2. If you can't find a toastmasters group that's still meeting in person, there should be opportunities at work to give a presentation. Volunteer for it and make sure a trusted friend can record you while you talk. Tell your boss you're working on your public speaking skills and need the video to improve. He will be impressed at your initiative.
6. **Cute Animals** \- This is the last one. Take pictures of you holding cute animals. Cute cats, cute dogs, cute rabbits, you get the picture.
   1. The local animal shelter usually has places you can go to take pictures with these animals for free. Careful though, some of them have been abused so keep on guard so you don't get bitten
   2. You can also go to Craigslist and search for puppies or kittens. A lot of owners sell puppies there and you can just offer to go see it and take a picture of it without buying.

**Won't Girls Know I'm Just Going Around And Asking To Take Pictures With Women?**

That's the most mindblowing experience I've had. Even if they know, they can't help being attracted! Preselection is that powerful. Even if they know you're just going around asking girls for pictures, they can't help but get wet when they see you next to hot girls.

Most girls won't even be able to figure out what you're doing. Their attention spans are too low to dive in deep into stuff like this and they'll just see you as a high value man, not even remembering the circumstances in which you guys met.

**Lessons Learned:**

High Value in the age of social media is just having a bunch of pictures that show you're a high value man.

If you keep getting flaked on or ghosted by younger girls, it's because you didn't spend enough time building a strong social media presence.

Of course, if you're super good looking or have an actual $10K/day CEO job, the younger girls won't care and will even delight in teaching you how to use Instagram! That's why it's so important to keep working on your real value as a man.

But for everyone else that's struggling to make it, don't forget that there's more ways than ever to raise your attractiveness.

In fact, if you actually follow this guide and create a high value instagram step by step like I outlined here, the only problem you're going to have is that your value is TOO HIGH, and the girl will be hesitant to go out with you because she thinks you're a fuckboy.

That's why it's so important to build comfort through text and not just text for logistics immediately. Every other fuckboy (a lot of them better looking and more ripped then you) hits her up to come over right away. You really set yourself apart by showing some empathy and building comfort first.

The 10 Unopened Snapchats Phenomenon and why Gen Z simps think 'text game' is necessary,"I'm not much of a writer so I'm going to make this quick.

&amp;#x200B;

Any man who has fucked his share of gen Z 18-22 year old girls has noticed the same phenomenon out of the corner of his eye - The girl opens her snapchat and the entire conversation screen is full of unopened snaps from other guys with tons of emoji's meaning they have been snapchatting her every single day for weeks/months. (Probably sending her memes like some of the dumbest advice found on this sub recently)

&amp;#x200B;

Attraction cannot be negotiated. We don't give a fuck if you think 'the times have changed'. Women have not just received a 2.0 update.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do Gen Z men think text game is necessary? Because these men are quite literally the loneliest, lowest testosterone, lowest value men of history.

&amp;#x200B;

To a Gen Z simp, success with a girl = her replying to his messages. Therefore if he doesn't give up and continues to send her a meme every 3-7 days, she might reply and that's success for him.

Pathetic.

They have such low abundance that they don't want to risk texting for logistics because of course it leads to more rejections.

But that's a good thing.

It's a streamlined way of finding the girls who have high interest in you. If they don't come to meet you in person from that kind of text, they don't have high interest in you and even if you convince her to meet you after a month of texting, the meet up is going to be dead. She is only going to come because she had nothing else to do and will spend her time looking at her phone. Or she'll probably flake because you were giving her all the validation she needed through text instead of in person.

Go from simp to pimp. From text game to text for logistics.",329,1

Comprehensive Guide to Modern Text Game,"**Intro:**

Society sure moves fast‚Ä¶

Just 5 years ago, you could follow the Sidebar recommendations to only text for logistics and do just fine.

Focus on the interaction. Don‚Äôt worry about fancy text tricks.

Well, 5 years later, that information is out of date.

You can‚Äôt just text for logistics anymore for younger women. It doesn‚Äôt work.

If you don‚Äôt believe me, go ahead and try classic RedPill text-for-logistics text game on a Gen Z woman today. I guarantee you, you won‚Äôt be able to get her to go out with you even if you did everything right in the initial approach

So unless you want to be stuck banging 35 years or older women, you better make sure your text game is up to date and current with modern times.

**Body:**

**Your Ultimate Goal with Text Game:**

Your ultimate goal is to get the girl to meet with you in person. The home run is if you can get her to come to your place, but even a drinks date is good.

Nothing else matters.

Do not become text buddies with her, it will never lead to anything good. Sex only happens in person.

This is one thing the old style of texting for logistics game got 100% right. Get her out in person. The problem is it‚Äôs a lot harder to get these Gen-Z and millennial girls out nowadays since it‚Äôs so easy to be entertained in their little virtual worlds.

Not to mention they pretty much all heard these crazy stories from their friends and social media about girls getting pumped and dumped by Chad so they‚Äôre a lot more resistant to getting fucked by a stranger now, even if he‚Äôs hot.

Sure you can bang a bunch of lower value girls from dating apps, but why do that when investing in text game can consistently convert girls your league or higher?

You actually need to have some texting skill now, you can‚Äôt just expect the initial interaction to do all the work for you.

This is especially true post Covid-19.

You really think a prime 20 year old girl will risk going out with someone she barely even knows nowadays if you just text for logistics without laying any groundwork?

**Standard Text Game Progression:**

There are 4 potential stages a girl is in at any point once you get her number.

Stage I: Not interested and Radio silence

Stage II: Not interested but still texting back

Stage III: Slightly interested but not enough to meet up

Stage IV: Interested enough to meet up

As you can see, texting for logistics works perfectly fine once you‚Äôre in Stage IV. The problem is, most younger women are not going to be in Stage IV unless you already laid some ground work.

There‚Äôs too many distractions these days. In person meetups are harder than before. Sure it‚Äôs probably easier to ask a low value girl to come over and fuck than ever before, but to get a standard date, definitely takes more work.

Your Strategy for every Stage is to move them further down the Stages until they are in Stage IV. That‚Äôs it. Nothing else matters.

Do not skip any steps ‚Äì EVER.

You can FUCK UP surefire leads by not going through the Stages in order. There was a cute mixed girl I met at a convenience store that went from not responding to asking what I was doing on Halloween night right out of the blue! Score! Except, I moved too fast and asked her over to my place immediately and was stuck with nothing that night since I didn‚Äôt move her down the stages naturally.

You will scare younger girls off if you move too fast. Follow the steps and you won‚Äôt have that problem.

**Strategy for every step:**

**Stage I: Not interested and radio silence** ‚Äì Ah, the worst place you can possibly be in after you get a girl‚Äôs number. She‚Äôs not even texting you back.

First of all you can greatly reduce the chances of that happening by NOT sending a boring first text in the first place. You know, the standard: ‚ÄúHey, nice meeting you in Psychology class today. What‚Äôs your schedule looking like for this week? I know this awesome bar herpa derpa derpa derp‚Äù

Believe me, every other guy is sending that exact same kind of text so you do nothing to differentiate yourself.

The best first text to send is something that gets her in a good mood.

You want her to subconsciously associate you with good feelings every time she opens your message.

Memes are perfect for this purpose.

That‚Äôs right Memes.

There‚Äôs 2 types of memes that work: funny memes and motivational memes. You can find them in Facebook groups or Reddit subgroups or even just google search.

All you gotta do is make sure the meme is relevant to your initial interaction in some way. For example, if she says she‚Äôs a teacher, google ‚Äòteacher memes‚Äô and send one of the funnier memes you find.

This immediately sets you apart from other guys and shows you‚Äôre a happy, chill guy, not needy for her attention at all. You‚Äôre just here to spread good vibes.

And if she doesn‚Äôt respond to your text? Send another meme in 3-7 days. Don‚Äôt be needy and send a meme every single day. Just once a week is good.

Every time a girl stops responding, you always put them on what I like to call ‚Äúthe Meme follow up list‚Äù. Your goal is to get them to associate you with good vibes so they‚Äôre excited to open your messages every time you send them.

It‚Äôs ok to double text if the later text is a meme because you‚Äôre just sharing something funny, not asking for anything in return.

So anyways, if the girl doesn‚Äôt respond, send another meme every 3-7 days. If she does respond, it‚Äôs on to Stage II.

**Stage II: Not interested but still texting back ‚Äì** this is where the girl is actually responding to you but most guys kill it by moving too fast and asking them out immediately.

Your goal in this step is to get her to the Hook Point, where she starts opening up about herself and most importantly, asking you questions about your life.

In order to hook her, you must ask her open-ended questions about herself and ‚Äúforce‚Äù a connection with her by relating it to your own life.

You do this by making a statement about her, an educated guess, then asking an open-ended question based on that guess.

‚ÄúYou have an intellectual vibe about you. What are you studying right now in university?‚Äù

I‚Äôve tested everything from gamey lines to witty lines. This works best. Nobody else is doing it intentionally, forcing a connection with her this way.

And the true beauty of text game is that you can just Google whatever it is she tells you about herself, even if you don‚Äôt know anything about the topic!

If she says she‚Äôs studying nursing, you can google nurse stories + reddit and find tons of first hand reports from nurses on Reddit that can‚Äôt be faked.

You just say, oh cool, my sister (or my best friend) is also a nurse and then give a fake anecdote from your Reddit research.

Then you keep asking her open-ended questions this way, only revealing what you wish to reveal and nothing more.

Remember, it‚Äôs about law of least effort. If you‚Äôre just hitting her up with witty text messages all the time, she‚Äôs going to subconsciously realize you don‚Äôt really have anything better to do with your life.

If you actively build this connection, even though you‚Äôre taking more time, it looks like you‚Äôre just naturally having a conversation.

Witty game lines take less effort but appear to require more effort on your part

Building an artificial connection takes more effort but appears to require less effort.

It‚Äôs all about the appearance, not the reality.

If you did everything correctly, pretty soon she will reach out and ask you questions about yourself. A lot of girls will even ask you for a picture unless you traded instagrams since they have so many other guys hitting them up they don‚Äôt remember what you look like.

**Stage III: Slightly interested but not enough to meet up** ‚Äì And now you‚Äôre here. She‚Äôs investing in you, but not enough to go out yet.

The most important part of this Stage is to not fuck up anything by actually opening up yourself.

Lots of normal guys will naturally want to reciprocate at this point. ‚ÄúHey, she‚Äôs opening up! I better do the same and reveal all my weaknesses and vulnerabilities like a beta!‚Äù

No.

Everything you reveal about yourself is planned out. If it doesn‚Äôt lead you closer to fucking her in bed, throw it out.

She‚Äôs going to ask you what you do for a living, and you NEVER reveal the truth that you‚Äôre working in a boring 9-5 job. Instead, you tell her about what your dream is.

I‚Äôm working my butt off to get my own business off the ground, or I‚Äôm looking to go pro in XYZ field is 10 times better than, ‚ÄúI suck my boss‚Äôs dick at a boring office job‚Äù

If she asks for your picture, you better fucking make sure you have some good ones to send. None of that picture in the bathroom mirror shit.

High value pictures only. Pictures of you with hot girls, pictures of you in nice restaurants, pictures of you doing adventurous stuff, leading other men, etc. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to pay a professional photographer to get these. It‚Äôs not that hard.

Pretty soon, it‚Äôll be time to ask her to go out with you, and you‚Äôre not gonna use any gamey lines or other witty texts.

Instead, you‚Äôre going to use Empathy to get her to come out with you.

Doesn‚Äôt matter if you actually care about her or if you‚Äôre dark triad like me and need to fake it.

Empathy is your most powerful tool for closing over text and securing the in person meeting. Just send her the following text word for word after she opens up about something.

‚ÄúListen come on over to &lt; bar near your house&gt; and let‚Äôs talk about it. Otherwise I‚Äôll make other plans‚Äù

After that, she may come up with some objections. And if she objects in any way, you must address the objection or she won‚Äôt convert.

If she says it‚Äôs too far away, reschedule to somewhere closer to her house or offer to pick her up if you have a nice car.

A lot of the times, she won‚Äôt actually respond and you‚Äôll get radio silence. This is because most girls these days are cowards and too scared of even saying their real objection.

In that case, it‚Äôs your job as a man to move things forward and bring their hidden objection into the limelight.

‚ÄúHey, I get the feeling you‚Äôre still on the fence about me, that I might break your heart or something. I get it, we don‚Äôt have to do anything you aren‚Äôt ready to. But let‚Äôs just see how things go. We‚Äôre just chilling.‚Äù

Just make an educated guess as to what her real objection is and address it for her.

If all goes well, you‚Äôre now in Stage IV. If not, there must be some other hidden objection in her mind she‚Äôs not telling you.

Try your best to guess from her vibe what that is and keep overcoming these objections as best you can until she changes her mind.

‚ÄúHey, I totally understand. You probably just broke up with your boyfriend. Listen, it‚Äôs ok, I get it, it sucks, come over to &lt;bar near your house&gt; and let‚Äôs talk about it. Either way, let me know asap cuz my other friend wants to hang out too‚Äù

A girl‚Äôs mind is like a lock. You only need to ‚Äúpick‚Äù the right combination of objections, and it will open. Keep trying and don‚Äôt give up after the first failure.

**Stage IV: Interested enough to meet up**

And now, you‚Äôre in the promised land.

You can text for logistics now and be all set.

You don‚Äôt need to do all this fancy text game anymore once you‚Äôve fucked a girl good and she‚Äôs your fuck buddy. Just text for logistics like they recommend in the side bar and you‚Äôre good to go.

Text game is for converting new girls, not for maintaining existing plates.

""Red Pill"" has been co-opted by a lot of morons who would be laughed out of the sub, especially on YouTube. /u/rpu_mike and I have been covering a lot of the sidebar in a new format through RP University, and doing interviews with various relevant characters and the occasional EC.

This show will be interactive to the extent we have questions that follow rule zero, with DTC and /u/itiswr1tten working directly with call ins.

The general theme of the show is, much like the radio shows before us, the RP way to deal with sexual strategy, having a good time, and otherwise the degenerate shit you get into when you're out playing the field.

"Creating your frame, it starts with your thoughts","When we have thoughts of confidence we tend to naturally exude confidence. Rather than having thoughts of ‚Äústand up straight, shoulders back, look straight ahead‚Äù if we have thoughts such as ‚Äúall women love me‚Äù (even if that thought is questionable) we tend to reach the desired result more efficiently and naturally. 

When we have these thoughts we are inspired to take action and override self doubt. If we see a hot woman, some may think ‚Äúshe is so hot, is she too good for me?‚Äù. Men that think ‚Äúall women love me‚Äù will be more likely to approach her an act in an attractive way. It is a self fulfilling prophecy.

Now, you must have a level of confidence to *believe* these thoughts, otherwise they are just noise. If you‚Äôre not naturally confident, that‚Äôs where ‚Äúfake it till you make it‚Äù comes in. If you don‚Äôt initially believe these thoughts you need to tell yourself these thoughts and take the action that such a thought would trigger until it becomes natural and you believe it. Reinforcing the loop.

When you are feeling shitty about yourself, these thoughts probably don‚Äôt arise naturally. That‚Äôs where conscious control comes in. Force these thoughts in your mind and you will feel change.

As they say, change starts from within, and your thoughts control so much of your life. You need to consciously feed confident thoughts and believe them and take action to create change.",99,1

True Knowledge only for Men (Ubermench / Supramen),"Historical scientific knoledge has been collected and developed mainly by men, even in spirituality for a reason.

It is no coincidence that most scientific discoveries and Nobel laureatees are primarily me.

Nature dictates that while the females focuses more on the emotional, facade, and social gossip relationship, it is the man who from birth is biologically focused on solving problems, theses being  the ones who contribute the most to society technologically.

Althought that most spiritual cultures dictate that sex should only be used for descendence, avoiding expending vital energy for development to a higher state of man.

Our ancestors already knew about the female promiscuous nature, giving free rein to them would lead to today's society.

Thats is why the culture of arranged marriage was stipulated, prioritizing descent over female promiscuity, the latter being the current female society.

It is the decisive nature of man that has led us to be what we are now.

"Society is in decline, so are testosterone levels","This [graph](https://www.healio.com/~/media/images/news/print/endocrine-today/2007/02_february/testosterone_344_273_23983.gif?la=en) from a research that was conducted from the 20th century to the late 00's show that testosterone levels have been slowly, but steadily declining over generations. 




Why is testosterone important?
-
Humans are animals. We are instinctual creatures, our sole reason of existence is first to survive, then mate with females and bring offsprings to this earth. 

We prioritize survival, not particularly because we need to live, but actually because we need to live to be able to reproduce. 


From a primitive perspective, our reason of living is to have sex and reproduce.



Testosterone is the primary sex hormone for men, if you relate this to what I'm saying, I'd go even as far as saying that testosterone is the life force of a man. 



High testosterone men show more energy in their lives, more motivated to go out there and build shite, more assertive, more confident in themselves, more creativity, more vigor and more aggression. Aggression part is especially important because men in 21st century are like puppies, you can do anything to it and it won't react. 


Low testosterone is commonly associated with depression and being unmotivated to do stuff. Men with low testosterone act like they're women.  No high testosterone man is lazy &amp; unambitious &amp; unmotivated, they will always be struggling to put something out there. 

In my opinion (which is nowhere near scientific, I'm not a doctor), a good testosterone level is around 1000ng/dL. Endocrinologists are downplaying it and saying around 500 is fine, that's not very low, but it's suboptimal. And that's your life force.

Why is it declining? 
-


There are 2 sides to this: physical and mental. Biggest part is physical, because the relationship between our hormones and our psychology is that our hormones decide what kind of action we are going to take. 

Have you ever heard of what is called ""endocrine disruptors""? These endocrine disruptors work in a way, literally, disrupts the way the body works. [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_disruptor) right here says that ""These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders""

There is no man who started a war with his body and won. 


One other thing the endocrine disruptors doing is, is lowering the testosterone levels. Between 80's and 00's, men's testosterone levels decreased about %30. 


Bisphenol A is an organic compound found in almost every plastic, it's a weak synthetic estrogen. 


Lack of hard physical activity is also one of the biggest reasons, we are nowhere near doing as much physical work as we did in the nature. 


Sleep problems is another reason.


I don't know if you noticed it, but whenever I watch an old TV show, I can't help but notice that men's voices are so deep. And women's voices are so soft compared to 21st century. 



One thing I've heard is that women take The Pill, then pollute the water with their piss full of estrogens, and it contributes to the decline of T levels.  



Mental side is that, in a research it has been found psychologically masculine women release more testosterone than normal women. They are not masculine because of their hormones,  Not really too sure about that, but there is a big feminization happening in the whole world right now via media, human brains are being rewired to think that ""feminine behavior"" is to be rewarded in relationships, real life, whatever you think. 



The actual reason why is that feminized, not masculine men are easier to control, and most part of these things come down to consumerism and money. 











Is testosterone and society's decline related? 
-


Strong men create good times (comfortable masculine, patriarch societies)

Good times create weak men (feminine men)

Weak men create feminine societies (hysterical, power hungry women)

Feminine societies create strong men (because someone has to put things in order)

Feminine societies are always replaced by masculine societies because it's in feminine's nature to submit to masculine.


What to do about it? 
-




Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) and lifting are your safest 2 bets. The upper echelon in the businesses usually take TRT, because testosterone suppresses cortisol (which is the stress hormone), and it positively affects their performance. 


If you're under 25, just stick with lifting and a good diet. Don't use TRT, and nobody will prescribe you with it either. 





If you never had high testosterone, you'll never know what it's like to have it. You don't need to read up on game, because your personality will be already set in the way that you will apply the game unconsciously etc etc",239,1

102 Basics: How to Punch Fucking Sharks (Mental Game Prime),"Hello!

Back by popular demand, (and because who the FUCK doesn't love that delicious-ass endorphin high from social proof and validity), I am here to talk about this week's topic:

**""Mental Game and why you should be ready to punch a fucking shark at any goddamn given moment""**

For those that missed it, **Get On Your Shit and Shut the Fuck Up** by reading Part 1  
(Edit: Search my username in this sub for my previous post from last week, Can a mod help a brotha out?)   


Note 1: Make sure to skim the comments, there was some good Q &amp; A shit

**Note 2: Read the FUCKING side bar.**  


Feel free to cosign or tear my ass a new one in the comments below. This is primarily for the newer people (two years or less) who are struggling to 'get it'. **Fuck all the noise**, You need to get back to the basics and stick with what fucking works. My aim is to provide people with immediate, actionable, no-nonsense strategies that are proven to get results and to stay away from the theoretical preaching and labels we have all collectively pre-occupied ourselves with using. Enough bullshitting, let's talk about **Something Important: Mental Game.**

You need to understand from a very fundamental level the essence of **Mental Game**, because the benefits are far-reaching and can show value in every segment of your life. You are here, reading this post, because **you fucking do not get it.** Congrats. You suck. I know it, you know it, the girls you failed to bang in high school know it, and the ones who ignore your ass at the bar as soon as you approach could smell it on you before you opened your damn mouth. But. **But.** It isn't the end of the world, because you are now taking steps to *unfuck yourselves*. Congrats.  


Welcome to the Process.

Life is **not** fair. It never was fair, and it will **never** be fair. You must find within yourselves the **Peerless Resolve** to deal with the fucked up situations you find yourselves in, most likely because you did (or said) some **dumbfuck shit.** Mental Game is your saving grace and it is the one thing that is going to keep your stupid ass from making shit worse, and also convincing others you're in control through your actions. Being able to dictate the terms and **framing** of your interactions, from personal to professional, is a *significant* competitive advantage you most definitely want to have in your arsenal.

**What is Mental Game?**  
Mental Game is simply confidence and the perspective you keep in your mind, by choice. There are many theories and buzzwords that people like to use to describe it, but it can simply be broken down to *two core areas* that each and every single one of your special **snowflake** asses is required to master, and they contribute to a directly applied concept that you can actualize in almost every area of your life. **Mental Game can be broken down into** ***""Internal Fortitude"" and ""Emotional Control"", and these directly contribute to becoming 'Outcome Independent"".***

**The fuck is an 'Internal Fortitude'? What?!**  
*An Unbreakable Will is the unfaltering, absolute faith that things are working in your favor and that regardless of any situation, you are in control and there are no limits imposed on your actions or reality*. This is the unyielding sense of identity you'd want to have when someone pulls a gun on you, and you put that shit to your forehead and tell them to *fucking pull the trigger and do it!* to call their bluff and they back down. The kind of quiet, unwavering intensity that silences an entire room just be staring at them, the kind of intense aura that instantly declares you as an authority unable to be challenged; these are the kind of **fucking balls** you want to **punch fucking sharks** if they threaten you in the ocean, the kind of unrivaled, determined, knuckle down, dug-in, unrepentant resilience that Men have when tasked to do the suicidally impossible; the kind of **unbreakable will** that can only be inspired by **someone who is doggedly pursuing their True Purpose.** Their Path, Their Truth, Their Mission, Their Calling; whatever the fuck you want to call it. At any given moment, you should know you **abso-fucking-lutely cannot be kept from your purpose, by no mortal or God until your Purpose is fulfilled, and ONLY your Purpose is allowed to fucking kill your ass. No Man, Beast, or Otherwise is permitted to touch you until the place and time of your choosing, on your terms, and only for what you designate as Worthy, For your True Purpose.** Your purpose is key, because it drives you to be better, and to give your life meaning. Without it, you stand for **nothing,** and will likely live a life of **Mediocrity. I shouldn't have to say this,** but if you don't think you should have one, fucking downvote this post and close the tab, never come back to TRP. **Get The Fuck Out My Damn Face.**

**How do I get such Internal Fortitude?**  
This is the million dollar question. The answer is one that is not easy or universally applicable, but is each custom tailored to the experiences and lives of every single person. *You can only obtain this mental state by going through multiple difficult hardships and experiences, and understanding how to dig deep. You also need to find a calling or purpose that keeps you focused and motivated, and never become complacent*. ""Rock Bottom has a Basement"" (and it leads straight to hell) and you have to know where that padlocked door is. For some people, that may look like becoming near or actually homeless with so little money they can't afford any nasty ass fast food, and this breaks them to a point where they say **""never FUCKING again""**. Once you hit that low, and you come back from that, you become aware of *exactly* how much you can fucking lose, and setbacks don't intimidate you anymore since you've explored the depths of failure, become intimate with ineptitude, obtained carnal knowledge of absolute dereliction (because it fucked you in the ass). For others, they have to come to terms with and master their internal demons. You can't hang out with the demons, but you know they just live around the block, and you've faced them and accepted them as part of your personal flaws; your demons don't own you and cant be used to manipulate you. Other times, people have to literally face death in the face and tell it to **fuck right off** and live to tell the tale. And even for some, they don't need these dire situations but the catalyst is finally getting a pity fuck from an average looking girl, or going skydiving, or finally doing something you've always wanted. You may have the inclination to shoot at people who don't look like you in foreign countries who shoot at you. Doesn't Matter. **There isn't just 'One' thing** and it's usually multiple circumstances that contribute to building this mentality. **You need have an unshakeable faith that at the end of the day, regardless of circumstance, You. Fucking. Win.** Once you have experienced this enough, you've had your mettle tested through the crucible, you'll be confident in everything else you do because those other experiences couldn't take your ass out so whatever else you're facing you know you are able to handle; ""shit cannot *possibly* go as sideways as the other times, and if it does I know how to handle it"" or ""I'll never let shit get that bad again"". It's the same kind of shit drug addicts that quit cold turkey say to themselves. Once you have this shit, **it is Your Own, and nobody else's, and nobody can take it from You. This is the source of your Internal Fortitude. This is how you Punch Fucking Sharks.**

**The fuck is an 'Emotional Control'? Huh?!**  
This is a topic I **know** we collectively as modern men have a **serious fucking problem with mastering.** Too many guys I've seen and met have no fucking clue, whine and bitch in public, have no self respect, and can't handle the most basic of stressful situations or bend over backwards at the slightest hint of resistance. They don't advocate for themselves, and put the needs of others before their own constantly. They cave at the first sign of aggression. And to them I say, ""Have you ever tried **nutting up and punching the goddamn shark?"".** *Emotional Control is the ability to maintain a centered space in your mind and not let external situations impact your emotional state to the point you lose control of yourself or your actions. Remember that if you lose control, you can be manipulated by people who do not have your best interest in mind.* A fat ugly bitch throws her drink at you at the club, your boss cusses you out in front of a client, your recent ex texts you says she's pregnant, you get a call that your parents died in front of some girl you're trying to bang that is out of your league; all of these are situations that **demand mastery of emotional control.** Having a bad reaction or losing control at key moments can multiply the negative consequences in dire situations, and being able to remain objective and maintain a sense of clarity will help you make good choices that work in your favor and often pay dividends in the future. You don't get do-overs or mulligans, you gotta get this right the shit **First Time**. Situations can be as simple as someone cutting you off in traffic on the wrong day and you lose your fucking mind, it doesn't matter. Never lose emotional control. Ever. **Ever.** This is not a recommendation to be emotionally distant or robotic, but understanding that there is a time and place to process your **bitch ass** emotions and not letting your emotions run you. Having a measured response may be the *integral* difference between life and death.

**How do I get such Emotional Control?**This is actually easy, there are many self-help books and things you can do to help reflect, such as meditation or martial arts or running or whatever (everything isn't for everyone, but there is something that fits for you ou there). The key here is to understand how -you- react in stressful situations and how to help you quickly adjust to these happenings in an expedited manner. Some people have developmental shit going on that interferes with this (you autists know who you are), other people may have anger issues from their parents or whatever the fuck else. Sometimes some shit isn't our fault, but it's still our responsibility to resolve that shit. Shit sounds hella BIG ghey, but that doesn't change the fact it's relevant. Since we're here, explore some ideas around ""Emotional Maturity"" and ""Emotional Intelligence"" if you've never heard those terms before. The vast majority of people reading this probably would benefit from a refresher, bare minimum. **Go fix your shit.**

**The fuck is an 'Outcome Independence""?**  
*The ability to not become emotionally invested and project a confident aura and suggest to yourself and others how they should* ***frame*** *situations or interactions with you, almost exclusively for your own agenda or benefit.* When you are outcome independent, you have your priorities straight and nothing fucking bothers you. Unless they are paying your bills or sucking your dick, their opinion probably means less than shit, and if they're in the above two categories they're probably full of shit anyway. Nah, they *ARE* full of shit. **Fuck them.** Being Outcome Independent allows you to take certain calculated risks that you otherwise may not have taken, or to attempt to do things you may have otherwise not wanted to try. It also allows you to remain balanced and keep the perspective that regardless of what happens, things are working in your favor. Want to approach that hot girl? The worst that happens is she rejects you. No big deal. Want to start that business? It'll probably fail and you'll lose some money, but you can make it back and if you are successful the upsides are amazing. Want to start that new hobby? By all means, if you don't like it you gained a new experience and learned something about yourself, and if you do like it, you have a new interest or passion. Whatever happens, it's all going to work out and it's all going to be to your benefit. Masters of this are capable of keeping calm in crisis situations and reduce fear and confusion in others. ""The ship is going down, *stay the fucking course!""*

This also extends to people around you as well, when people notice that you're never afraid of failure (and you leverage **social media** to highlight your successes, read part 1), you will start getting more attention from your **social circles** (plural on purpose, read part 1 comments) and can convince them that just by your actions, your smile, and your personality, ""**You're a fucking winner**"". Then people will go out of their way to lie to themselves about how cool you are, and this little thing called 'Halo Effect"" kicks in and you can do no wrong, also synonymous with 'Hot Girl/Guy Aura'. Don't worry, I'll remember you for the sad sack of shit you were when you first read this.

You **are** going to fall on your fucking face, and fail, **a literal fuckton.** *This is inevitable.* You need to be willing to stand back up, brush yourself off, try again, and **Punch that fucking shark**. Your **internal fortitude** will help keep your **emotions in check** so that you can **eventually arrive at the outcome you desire.**

Remember my sons, It's not about how many times you fall down, but how many times you get the fuck back up and get back out there.

"If your in jail, she‚Äôs most likely going to cheat. The sad truth of being a jail cuck.","Preface:

I‚Äôve learned a lot about the truth of long distance relationships over the past two and a half years. In 90% of most cases, it doesn‚Äôt last. Doesn‚Äôt matter how much you think you really have a shot at making it work, you always have to expect your significant other to eventually get bored, and start looking for other partners. 

A short backstory. So this girl (a solid HB8) that i‚Äôve know for about the better part of a year, is your typical pump and dump chick, looking for the next dick. I met her around July of 2019 from a good friend of mine. She‚Äôs seen me maybe a total of 5 times in person, and i‚Äôve never had a conversation with her at this point; never the less i get a screenshot from my boy of a line of text from her saying ‚Äúi want him to pipe me‚Äù. So with the assurance of her full interest I added her on snapchat, and it went from there. We fucked maybe 3-4 times over the span of 2 months, and then i really just kept her as a friend (with benefits lol). Was introduced to a whole friend group, would always party at her house, she had an absent father whom she low key obsessed about when we first met, and an alcoholic mother that let us do what the fuck ever; i‚Äôm sure you get the picture now. Anyways, fast forward to yesterday...

The Sad truth of the jail-cuck:

It‚Äôs been a while since we‚Äôve talked. I noticed she actually got a boyfriend that she was invested in for quite some time. Recently (like last month), he got arrested for lewd-las behavior, or statutory rape. He pled guilty to having a relationship with 12-year-old twins. Anyway, they are still together despite all of this dirt! Her rationalization for staying with this perv was because ‚ÄúHe treated me the best‚Äù. Sounds familiar don‚Äôt it? So he‚Äôs most likely going to prison for a number of years, and he always calls her everyday at around 9-10pm, and they chat for a couple of minutes. I digress.

For awhile i had this girl blocked on snapchat because we have an extensive exchange of sexual messages, and I had started dating another girl in about march, whom i actually had cared about. Long story short, things didn‚Äôt work out, so we broke up about a week ago. I just unblocked the booty call yesterday. Within the hour, we were talking at full speed again. Shes agrees to come over, but ‚Äújust to check out the new apartment‚Äù. Yeah, ok baby. So i go to pick her up and shes wearing this jacket, under it just so happens to be lingerie. We talk about her shitty beta boyfriend for about 30 minutes while we watch a pointless movie neither of us care about, and then thats when we start making out. After about two minutes the clothes came off and she starts sucking, and then i flip her over, and the rest is history. We ended up going back to her place and fucking some more just because i didn‚Äôt want my ex to walk in, as she is just moving out at the time. We get to her house, and now she starts whining about her ex. How he‚Äôs so sweet to her, and provides for her, but he cannot *please* her. I was trying to stop myself from laughing in all honesty. She does not actually give a flying fuck about this guy!!! She texted me telling me how much she missed us hanging out and how hot i was, and all i could do was feel bad for the other guy. He obviously really cares about her, but she will do whatever it takes to cum or get attention from other guys despite him! She says she ‚Äúloves‚Äù him, yet im the one on top of her! Despicable!!

I apologize for the long rant, i‚Äôm a newb poster/writer. This is really the moral of the story here.  
If your in jail, she‚Äôs most likely going to cheat. She knows the situation. If theres a chance you will be serving *years* in prison, she will begin her search for more feasible attention. This is the same principle as long distance relationships; time is the great factor that withers the bond which is usually set in place through physical contact and face-to-face moments. Everyone is different, but in most cases, if women aren‚Äôt bound to seeing you and being pleasured by you, then time is going to be your enemy. But not to be discouraged! Time is also the vehicle in which acceptance through experience and the healing of pain is possible in order to be at peace with ones self. Don‚Äôt be fooled, if you are not solid on how you feel about your girl‚Äôs faithfulness, do not commit to a long distance, or guys like me will her into a cum rag. 

TLDR; This one chick that i used to fuck got a nice-guy beta boyfriend who went to jail for statutory rape who she still considers her boyfriend, and he will be serving time, so she started texting me again and in the same day we fucked. Oh also forgot to mention when we woke up at her place he called in the MORNING while i was right next to her in bed instead of calling at night... what a strange coincidence.",170,1

Don't discuss TRP or feminism with simps and women.,"Today, I was out with my friends who are all red-pilled and their friends including some girls who I didn't know. These girls were really nice to me. Randomly my friend talked about this incident in his class today where this feminist got offended in her class because the teacher was discussing how to deal with different types of crime situations, and among those was a situation on women abuse.  This feminist started fighting the teacher for showing a cartoon clip on a man abusing the women and asking what the women should do or should have done. Out of 60 students, only she got offended and that was the funny part.

My other friend shouted ""Feminists"", just as a joke and I followed him and said the same because it was quite funny. Suddenly, this girl we were with got offended and said, ""you are the same guys who slide into girls' DMs."" Me trying to hold my frame told her, ""you should check my chatbox sometime.""(which is filled with girls initiating conversations with me.) The other girls also supported her. Even though these girls are conservatives, they still couldn't take a joke on feminism. We ended up apologizing because at the end of the day they are my friend's friends and I didn't want to ruin my day because of it. The entire time she seemed to be angry with me, but I couldn't be bothered. Almost like she instantly lost all her interest in me. Anyway, had a blast with the boys.

That's when it hit me, we are part of a generation where guys are taught to be simps all the time throughout their childhood, and women are taught to be self-independent. It should probably be the other way around IMO but whatever. This hardwires guys to grow into betas and girls grow into offense detectors. Your parents are not to be blamed for this because they too have grown in the same circumstances. Check the newspaper, it's only filled with women issues and rapes, you will barely find any news about men suffering. They sometimes do talk about men's issues to sound neutral but these are usually the smallest articles that one can find. Check the media, all left-leaning propaganda. What this does is create a subconscious negative mindset in innocent consumers that only men are the problem. So no matter, how many green flags the girl has, she won't take any shit against her gender, doesn't matter if it's a joke and who cracked that joke. The same shit happens when you drop a red pill on them. They will instantly get defensive because they are taught these stereotypes about men that any man who says anything negative about their gender is a sexist, misogynist, bigot, assaulter, etc.  I don't think girls are to be blamed for this too. People are lost, being mind-controlled, and stuck in the matrix.

LiFe Is AlL aBoUt BaLaNcE,"  

Balance is bullshit. If you ever hear anyone tell you that life is about ‚Äòbalance‚Äô, they probably didn‚Äôt get very far in life. They don‚Äôt know what being driven or obsessed is. They only know what being comfortable is.

When I was younger I used to think that balance was a good thing. I didn‚Äôt know any better. Some days you should work really hard and others you can set it on cruise control. That was the way I was raised. That there were days where I had ‚Äúearned‚Äù a day off or where I should just relax and watch a movie and eat ice cream.

Run the fuck away from that. If you want a higher than likely chance of being successful at what you are pursuing, there is no ‚Äòbalance‚Äô. ‚ÄòBalance‚Äô is for rookies, for amateurs. You may have gotten lucky before and have been able to conquer a feat with balance. I'm telling you to give 100% of your time, your energy, your focus, your discipline, on what it is you really want in life. And think long term.

Will this piece of cake or will this below average woman be an impactful resource to my long term goals? No? Then don‚Äôt do it.

You hear it all the time, but try to steer clear of being comfortable. Those who are comfortable have never taken risks or have never found their true potential. This is the easy way out and some live their entire lives in this lane. Here are some ways to stay out of the comfort zone:

\- Get up early to workout, even if you are tired, this forces you to EARN the day

\- Get your work/homework done early instead of toying around on the internet

\- Turn off the TV and read a book

\- Listen to podcasts instead of trash music

\- Turn down going out EVERY WEEKEND and stay in and be productive, get sleep for recovery purposes

\- De-activate trash social media so you don‚Äôt waste hours on it every week

\- Research nutrition so that you actually know what is going in your body

\- Research appropriate workout and stretching routines

\- Go to the grocery store and cook food instead of getting trash take out",9,1

Ex Boyfriend blows up a new plates phone,"If you're the ex boyfriend in this post **It's over. Leave with your pride and go lift.**  
  
**Background on the chick**  
  
The girl in this post is a HB8/9. One of the hottest chicks I've picked up from tinder and she superliked me which to me, is rare. She played it off like it was an accident but my hot load in her pussy told another story.  
  
**The date**
  
We spoke for a bit and she agreed to go get a coffee after I finished work, the shop was closed but had drive-thru open and we sat in my car in the parking lot listening to music and chatting, I'm constantly escalating and she was positively reacting to every move. She knew exactly what she wanted early on and while she was shit-testing, I expected a lot more resistance from her leading into it.  
  
Since there's literally nothing else open, I suggested a couple drinks back at my place, she agreed and we drove to the store and got some wine.  
  
The whole time she's in the car with me her phone was constantly buzzing, since she's relatively young (20) I thought it normal for her phone to be going off like that. But then it starts ringing over and over and I tell her to turn it off. She put it on do not disturb and we go back to my place.  
  
I stick on a movie and crack open the wine, within no time we're making out and clothes are coming off. She instantly goes down to blow me. I throw her on the bed right after and fuck her like a king, she was small and slim, submissive as fuck so I was throwing her around like a playtoy and she loved every second of it.  
  
We were both literally gassed the fuck out after we'd finished and we layed there in bed and she picked up her phone. Tens of missed calls and texts from a guy with a heart after his name in her contacts. She tells me it's her ex and he won't leave her alone. He saw her snapchat location and a story post of her with the coffee in hand in the passenger seat of my car and started going absolutely nuts. I'm on the fence at this point on whether it's actually her current boyfriend or in fact an ex. I confirmed with her it was her ex, she showed me old messages with him and she begins showing the messages he was sending her now.  
  
She was poking fun at the messages and said ""If he fucked me like you just did maybe we'd still be together"". The guy was calling her a whore, throwing random names at her of who she could be with, the usual breakdown scenario. While I laughed along at first, knowing I'd just fucked her and this poor guy was blowing up her phone wishing it was him. I eventually told her to stop and block the guy because she was using it for her own amusement at that point while he goes crazy.  
  
Why did I sympathise for him? Because that was me after my first relationship ended. I was the guy on the other end of the phone. It only happened once to me and some of us have been there, but it's a learning exercise. I hope that guy finds TRP.  
  
We've fucked a couple times since then and neither of us have brought it up since. While she's a babe, I know for a fact if I catch the ole ONEitis, I could be the next of that guy. Seeing it first hand like that is something else. This is what women do to us while we're bluepilled.  
  
**Additional side note**  
  
If this sounds like you. If you've come here for advice on how to win her back, you're here for the wrong reasons and you haven't absorbed shit yet. There's millions of other women out there. You can tell yourself ""Yeah but we had so much in common!!! She was the ONE"" but that's BULLSHIT stop blabbering you fucking pussy. Women are submissive, any woman you meet can have things in common with you. Oh okay, but the new one is missing something. Then guess what? You can have another woman for that too. You'll like some, you'll dislike some. Shit some of the girls I fuck I can't stand to be around for more than an hour afterwards and that's what makes it more fun, she pisses me off so much I can fuck her exactly how she wants to be fucked.  
  
Just don't stress over a bitch. It might feel like you lost your world, but pick up the pieces and leave with your PRIDE. Be a man. Have your own shit to worry about while the girls play in the sand pit. And for the love of god, don't get halfway and let the one you've been stressing about see you improve and jump right back in. Laugh in her face. Stay on track because if she'll throw herself back at you, so will other women, ones that didn't disrespect you as a man.",190,1
What I learned from being a simp,"What I learned from being a simp

If you treat her like a celebrity she will treat you like a fan. All the girls I was treating like a celebrity the girls I was obsessed with constantly complimenting feeding her lots of attention doing what Disney and society told me to do to get a girl to like me and to how to treat them . these girls treated me like a fan. And didn‚Äôt give a fuck.

She don‚Äôt care about you. She‚Äôs just loves what you do for her. Girls don‚Äôt care about there simps. In the eyes of the girls I was simping for I was a low value beta male. If that girl youre simping for cared about you you wouldn‚Äôt be her simp she wouldn‚Äôt be playing you.  Your nothing but free attention and favors while she simps for another guy. She uses you for attention cause the guy she really wants doesn‚Äôt give it to her. You‚Äôre nothing but a emotional tampon and if you have a gf and your her simp she‚Äôs probably cheating on you. 

She‚Äôs for the streets 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of the same girls I simped for later on when I wasn‚Äôt there simp anymore. I saw there nudes and them  getting fucked by Lots of guys. The same guys they were complaining about they gave these guys play but not me. I saw lots of hoe shit. Some of these girls had simp boyfriends too  who they claimed to love too. But they were cheating on I saw there nudes get leaked by countless literally guys the guys who didn‚Äôt give a fuck about them.

First cold approach ever,"Cold approach at local outdoor shopping center, had strong approach anxiety, like literally everyone else I‚Äôm sure. Only goal was to get the first one down, and trying to maintain outcome independence. 

Saw someone who looked cute and walked up, got their attention. Right off the bat they stuttered for words a little bit, then apologized for being nervous (wasn‚Äôt sure how to respond, but good for me because I was nervous too). Asked to walk with her and she enthusiastically agreed. Talked for a while, I was considering how I was going to close but before I could she came out and asked if she could please have my number. Texted me later on, I responded asking for availability. She seemed very interested. 

Notes:

I wasn‚Äôt very flirtatious or seductive and I didn‚Äôt touch her, I treated/talked to her like you would a high-value friend. Obviously, ideally I would have been flirtatious and seductive the whole time, however, I‚Äôm giving myself leeway as this was my first attempt. 

My goal is to become comfortable with the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù talking, then move the being more flirty as my confidence grows.

I need to do many more of these, and I‚Äôm thankful that my first attempt went so smoothly, leaving a good taste and a good example in my mind.",13,1

Alright very simple question for the group. Why not just make money and fuck hookers?,"So real talk. I've lurked this subreddit on and off for years. I've had good success with it in college when I was broke. But as I've grown I've come to realize something. I'm in my mid twenties making 6 figures, no debt, stable job. Assume my only goal is to get laid. 

Why not just get a hooker/sugar baby and be done with it? 

I have better things to do with my time than to brush up on game, cold/hot approach, care about how I dress/look just to attract some girl I don't want any LTR with. My time is important to me. I'd rather spend it with friends and family or on my career than reading all this TRP theory and stuff. 

This subreddit was useful back in college. It changed my frame of mind, got me working out, and overall has been a positive influence in those respects. But honestly I'm really doing well financially now and why not, once a week or two, get a really nice escort or meet with a sugar baby that I KNOW will sleep with me THAT DAY and NEVER WORRY ABOUT GAME AGAIN.

Idk it seems people on this sub aren't seeing the bigger picture. Life isn't all about getting laid. And if all you care about is penis in vagina you can get it much easier than training game, lifting for months/years on end, and hitting on girls all the time. But I'd like to hear your thoughts, maybe I'm not getting it.",24,1
I'd like to have a discussion on status/lifestyle symbols around the US and beyond from a red pill perspective and want to hear your experiences and observations.,"We hear a lot about social status on here, and building ourselves up to be successful, and then attracting people to join our world. While it's always good to not care as much about external things, we still are living in a material world, which gives us more chances to express ourselves through what we choose to own and how we live. Status symbols are still primal, and I don't think they should be ignored. 

Traditionally, a status symbol has been directly connected to displaying wealth. Whatever latest, most expensive car or technology comes out, wealthy people buy and show off. This is all well and good, and in these upper echelon social circles, is now at extremes that are almost unimaginable. 

Honestly I kind of find it boring in some ways. Like how it has extended to literally everything including $1500 small charcoal grilles.  But I'm not here to have a boring conversation so I want to talk about the status symbols which are not about hyper wealth, but a lifestyle or value system. 

For example, in a sports town, a status symbol might be season tickets. Do they cost a million dollars?  No. Do most people really care about that? No. But it would increase your social status in certain circles. The same people might be put off or give zero fucks about a Rolex on someones wrist worth twice as much. 

I live close to a sports town, but here, a status symbol might be a Jeep with a high quality bicycle on the back for the bike trail.

For women, the current trend is showing off how much you travel, to other women, because do men really care how many trips she has taken?  None the less, girls on tinder want to show off their vacation pictures. That is still somewhat connected to financial success, but more about a lifestyle. 

What I'm interested in finding out, now is:

what is a status symbol in your area?  In which group is this relevant?  Is it something that is acknowledged?  Is there an image you would like to have or lifestyle you want to live and what gear goes along with that?  Is there a trend in your area that makes zero sense to you and you think is stupid?  How has the red pill changed how you view these things?",33,1

**She called me crying when she found out that her ex-husband was getting married.** She didn‚Äôt know where she went wrong. Let me fuck her on the first date without a condom. Girls think that‚Äôs a deal breaker- that it‚Äôs *why* they can‚Äôt get a steady boyfriend; that the relinquishment of the completely unnatural and counter-intuitive modern notion of safe sex signals a moral deficiency so alarming it frightens away potential mates. Make things too easy and no one sticks around.

She doesn‚Äôt realize that she‚Äôs Alice in Wonderland, alone in the candy store, grabbing at tonsil ticklers with both hands. Men would kill for this experience- alone in the woods with a whittled tree branch. Covered in animal blood, or is it your own?

How I Turned A Formerly Low Interest Girl Into A Fuck Buddy,"How I Turned A Formerly Low Interest Girl Into A Fuck Buddy

Intro
About a year ago, I ran into this cute girl at a local leadership/public speaking meetup group. Let‚Äôs just call her Cait for ease of reference.

Blonde hair, blue eyes, ass to die for. That type of girl is generally not into Asian guys from my experience but luckily I hit it off with her.

She was playing with her hair, asking me lots of personal questions, and I thought I did a decent job of push pull and beating shit tests.

Unfortunately, I made one of the classic mistakes of not moving fast enough. Never asked for her number or asked her out. Just played it safe like a beta. And what do you know, after around a month of weekly meetups, the initial interest had completely evaporated.

She didn‚Äôt seem to want to chat at all anymore other than one word responses. And unfortunately that made me make an even bigger mistake - chasing harder. I decided to go for a Hail Mary and ask her out one day only to get a shitty excuse, ‚ÄúI have to meet my friend at the mall‚Äù

Oh well. Lesson learned for next time - move faster.

I also stopped going to that meetup group for the time being due to lack of interest on my part.

Body
I met her again just last week after a whole year of working on myself.

I was on month three of a steroid cycle and this is the first time I looked like I lifted while wearing a plain T shirt.

I just launched a new online business and was grinding hard every day learning copywriting and traffic buying

So I decided to drop by the meetup group again just to see how everyone was doing since I left.

More or less the same shit. Nobody seemed like they were any different one year to the next.

I went up to the room and gave an impromptu speech on the challenges I faced while building a business from scratch. Talked about the challenges of consistently going to the gym and making sure Diet is on point (of course I didn‚Äôt mention steroids at all for obvious reasons lol)

When I finished my talk, there were some mixed reactions as some people congratulated me on my success at the gym while others told me not to get too carried away with my new business because money isn‚Äôt everything.

What do you know, Cait comes up and introduces herself again asking if I remember her, acting all flirty and shit.

This time I learned from my precious mistake and traded Instagrams right away while planning a date on the spot to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù.  Told her I‚Äôm too busy these days to text back and forth but never too busy to meet a friend for drinks.

Met her at a local bar and it was one of the easiest pulls in my life. Didn‚Äôt have to use any of the more advanced push pull tactics I‚Äôve trained. All I did was hold frame, pass basic shit tests with agree and amplify, and escalate physically when she gave me flirty looks.

We were making out on the way back to my place and I just couldn‚Äôt believe how different this girl is from how she portrayed herself in public.

You look at her online profile and all you see if volunteering for her local Church, good Christian girl, looking to settle down and have a family...

Meanwhile we‚Äôre about to fuck on the first date... remember boys there‚Äôs no such thing as unicorns. AWALT and don‚Äôt ever forget it.

We got back and I encountered some pretty big last minute resistance. A lot more than expected. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never done anything like this before...‚Äù ‚ÄúI really like you and don‚Äôt want to rush things...‚Äù

‚ÄúOh God...‚Äù I thought to myself ‚Äúnot now...‚Äù

Followed standard 1 step back, 2 steps forward procedure. Pull back, relax and it was over after I removed my clothes and let her play with my cock.

Let‚Äôs just say there‚Äôs zero percent chance this good Christian girl was following everything the Bible says given how experienced she seemed while sucking dick. And what made it hotter is she kept trying to keep up the good girl persona as I was pumping the shit out of her. ‚ÄúPlease be gentle... please go easy... I don‚Äôt do this a lot...‚Äù

Guess what? She texted me this morning saying she never felt such a deep connection before, etc, and I‚Äôm seeing her again tomorrow night. Most likely to do some more nasty shit together.

Lessons Learned
It‚Äôs almost impossible to escalate too fast. Even if the girl says she doesn‚Äôt want it, it‚Äôs a lot better to play aggressively and keep pushing for what you want in a tactful way. A blowjob is a hell of a lot better than playing with your own dick at the end of the night. The key is that you must close in some way, even if it‚Äôs just oral sex.

Ambition is one of the biggest attraction triggers in women because even if your business ain‚Äôt doing anything yet, ambition means you have the potential to climb up. Don‚Äôt need to make a million dollars to have the sex life you truly want. Just need to have the ambition to do so and a solid plan to execute it.

If you truly want to get a girl that rejected you a long time ago, spend some time working on yourself. Then come back and show her how much progress you made. Works much better than begging for her affection like a dog.",157,1
Protip: Don't ignore red flags heres why,"So this happened a few months ago and after I saw the other lady‚Äôs post about her Hinge horror story, I knew I should write mine.

I am 26(M) and she was 27(F). We started texting for about 2-3 weeks and in this time, I had some intuition that she was crazy. Picking fights on little things, sending 8 texts after I don‚Äôt respond within 5 minutes, etc.

Anyways, I say YOLO and decide to hang out with her at her house. So I get there, and my first impression was that she was beautiful and all is good. We planned on making pizza and having some beer. Well, I get inside and the house is a mess. Like shit laying everywhere but i wasn‚Äôt there to judge. But this is where the fuck up starts. She tells me to take the pizza out of the oven because she‚Äôs never taken one out before.. I go ‚Äú...okay‚Äù and take it out. I cut it and we sit down to eat it on her balcony. Turns out her balcony had a nest and baby birds in it. Her dog starts to lick the hatchling and the egg of another. She tells me to grab the nest and throw it off the balcony. I refuse and then she tells me that she‚Äôs done it 5 other times and it‚Äôs no big deal. Red flag. I thought she was a Steven Avery for a second.

We then come inside to watch some Netflix and within 5 minutes she‚Äôs already moved to my lap and making out with me. Tells me to go into her room with her for sexy time. Rips off my jeans and proceeds to put it in after I asked her if I could get a condom before we started. She refused. I‚Äôm thinking red flag, run, she wants me to get her pregnant or what if she has an STD? I couldn‚Äôt just run for my car without pants on so I hung in there.. or in her? We‚Äôre midway thru when she gets off me and has a mental breakdown saying that I am just using her and I comfort her saying we should stop. She proceeds to get back on and finish me on her stomach. So I go to the bathroom to clean up my wet noodle and here I see red stuff in a puddle on the back of her toilet behind the seat. A little freaked out so I put my pants on and tell her I have to get up early for work.

I finagle my shoes on while small talking, she tells me she loves me and asks me to be her boyfriend, to which I tell her to slow her roll and that we will talk. Skedaddled my way out the door to my car where she then chases some geese. I get down the road not even 2 minutes and I have 8 missed calls (shit you not). Get home and go to bed and wake up with 5 texts and another 11 missed calls. One text called me a coward for not answering, then the next one saying that if I respond and work things out, I‚Äôm not a coward and then finally another one saying we‚Äôre done and I‚Äôm a coward.

I ended up blocking her so fast and kept texts for proof if she tried to pull a fast one on me with the police. And that is how I fucked up with meeting a girl on Hinge

Tl;dr: Met a girl off Hinge, wanted me to murder some birds, then she ripped my clothes off and told me I was using her. Claimed she was in love with me and called me 19 times within 10 hours. Blocked her",51,1
Good guys finish last always.,"So yesterday one of my top plates calls me and asks to meet up for lunch. Calendar empty, why not? So we meet up at this nice restaurant and she arrives ten minutes after me. She is dropped off by some dude literally. So we get to talking how she has been. Hadn‚Äôt seen her in like three weeks. Get some drinks and lunch.

Now here is the funny thing, about an hour in, she gets a call from a delivery driver, a package at the door. Hmmmm, curious as to what it is... she goes out and comes back with a bouquet of red and white roses. Like 30 of them plus chocolates. The dude who dropped her at the door, sent them as a romantic gesture. She told him she is meeting a good friend for lunch. 

She comes back with the roses and chocolate. I was like ‚Äúheck yeah, you finally landed a romantic dude to take care of you.‚Äù She was half smiling. Then she said something that shocked even me. She told me, **‚Äùdon‚Äôt you think this is kinda creepy??!‚Äù** then put them on the floor. I told her not to be to harsh on the dude as he was trying to impress her. She proceeded to say how he had been getting her things and now was starting to get creeped out. And asked why dude was well off, 30 years and didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend? She was basically writing the sidebar herself as I sat there intrigued. She used words like ‚Äúseems weak‚Äù and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt seem to be in charge‚Äù and ‚Äúshe wants a man who would dominate her‚Äù...

Listened to her ramble for a bit and proceeded to take her to a salsa dance place then took her to my place and fucked her brains out. She left me one rose as I called her an Uber. Texted me to say dude is taking her out of town for an overnight staycation at some resort. Asked me if she should bring me a bottle of whiskey as dude likes to buy. Sure...

I was this dude some years back. Dropping off a chic at a restaurant as she goes in to meet her friends after spending money on her. I was into the romance game. Now am on the other side of the curtain and one thing is for sure, it is fun to watch.

Stay safe",218,1

"Get on your grind, get your own place, it will save you so much time and effort","Boys. I'm in pain. I'm 22 and I've been self improving and I hopped back onto tinder (just for a few weeks) to try and test my luck again. I've matched some gorgeous women and have 4 potential prospects right now, and two of them are super down to link up and spend time with me. However, one doesn't have her own place either and doesn't like car sex so I'd have to get a hotel, the other is 19 and wants to drink with me but can't legally drink yet so she's hinting at me inviting her over.

I am in my last month of college. I've put work aside to focus on school as it is the priority. I live with my parents and brother, and everybody is home ALWAYS especially due to COVID. Do you understand just how much pussy I've had to let go because I didn't have my own crib? 

So please, as soon as you can, work on getting your own place because it's so nice to simply invite a chick over to smoke hookah/drink/smoke a blunt/watch netflix. Plus the moment she agrees to come over she knows what's going down. I fucking hate this and it's not nice spending $65 on a room to have a fling with a chick. What if she changes her mind last minute? $65 gone. Keep working hard boys.",1,1

Attraction 101,"There's this boy, Nick. He's looking at his phone for the 10th time in 5 minutes. Taking his courage and his phone in both hands, after days of hesitation, he sends a text message containing an invitation to the movies to the sublime Audrey, the girl with whom he has the incredible opportunity to do his teamwork in philosophy. It took him an hour to put the 143-character text message together. Nick has been able to see ""'read'"" next to the text message for a good 20 minutes. Still no answer.

&amp;#x200B;

**What factors explain the level of attraction that different characters have for each other?**

**Why do two people remain engaged in an unsatisfactory relationship?**

**Are there different types of love?**

**With whom do we form relationships?**

&amp;#x200B;

*In love as in hunting, the real pleasure is poaching.*

\- Honor√© de Balzac

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, we connect with others because our interpersonal relationships meet certain affiliate needs. The complexity of our social network reflects the variety of needs to be met.

&amp;#x200B;

There are certain factors that predict attraction. Situational factors such as **closeness** and **familiarity** can promote attraction, as we are more attracted to people who are close to us and whom we see more often. Beware, too much familiarity with the person can lead to a considerable decrease in attraction and conflict.

But the question remains, what attracts us to others in the first place? Their personality? Their sense of humour? Their intelligence? Their good mood? Their values? Of course, it's frowned upon to answer that what attracts us above all in others... is their physical appearance. In fact, it's revealing that people looking for partners through dating sites or applications like Tinder avoid talking about the physical beauty they are looking for in a partner. They say they want to meet a nice, reliable person with a good sense of humor. However, they carefully choose the photos they post on their profile, even retouch them to make themselves more attractive, and they lie about their physical characteristics (weight, height, etc.) especially if they don't feel favored by nature. No matter how much we pretend that we don't judge a book by its cover and that it's the inner beauty that counts, we won't hide here, we have to face the facts: **physical appearance is a primary determinant of attraction**. It wasn't Audrey's sparkling personality that first attracted Nick, but his **appearance**.

&amp;#x200B;

Personal factors also affect attraction. Certain personal characteristics affect attraction: physical beauty and **resemblance as opposed to complementarity**. Likeness is a good factor, it can be demographic, activity or interest, culture or values, and finally physical beauty. We establish relationships with people who seem to have a level of beauty equivalent to our own. Basically, humans do not look for a person who is too beautiful, for fear that they will not appreciate and reject us, nor do we choose a person who is unattractive. We intuitively evaluate our market value and look for someone whose value corresponds to ours.

&amp;#x200B;

Physical beauty has a considerable effect on attraction. One of the explanations for this phenomenon is the notion of **bias in favor of beauty:** we spontaneously grant beautiful people beautiful qualities. When we look at the cover of a book, we draw all sorts of conclusions about its contents. The same would be true about people: when we see an attractive person, we attribute all sorts of beautiful qualities to him or her.

&amp;#x200B;

There are 4 theories that explain the effect of similarity on attraction, whereby people who look alike attract each other. One of the first explanations would be because a similar person creates a more balanced relationship. The second is that we simply like people who look like us because they reinforce who we are. The third possible explanation is that resemblance between love partners may be a consequence of relationships, not a prerequisite for bonding. Finally, the last explanation states that we have relationships with people who look like us for the simple reason that it is this type of person that we are most likely to encounter in our everyday lives.

In addition, we may have a tendency to associate with people who are **complementary** to us in terms of personality, resources or skills. Another personal characteristic is **reciprocity** (we love those who love us), particular personality traits and financial health. A good example is Melania and Trump. A beautiful young woman and a rich but aging man. This type of exchange is not always done in this sense, but it is becoming more and more common for middle-aged women to capture the young Adonis.

The happiest couples are composed of one dominant and one submissive person or two partners who are neither.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a theory that explains love relationships: that of social exchange. It is explained by the fact that satisfaction in the intimate relationship depends on the benefits and costs associated with it, as well as on the level of comparison of the individual. Commitment in a relationship depends on **satisfaction**, but also on the **investments** that have been made in it and on the quality of the other relationship possibilities. Thus, we can answer the question why the husband, with 2 houses and 3 children, stays in the relationship after being cheated 40 times with the village baker. It is simple, it is because he has made a considerable investment. What has been invested in a relationship can never be recouped in the event of a break-up. This is cognitive dissonance. He changes his attitude towards the relationship in such a way as to justify the investment.

You should now be able to answer the questions above.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus

Interestingly fact: A person experiencing physiological reactions as a result of a pronounced state of activation (hiking in the mountains) will look in their environment for what puts them in such a state. If this individual is in the presence of another pleasant person, he or she may fall in love. 

This is the **transfer of arousal**: the activation caused by one stimulus is carried over to the activation caused by another stimulus, and is added to it.",4,1

Being good at texting won't get you laid,"INTRODUCTION:

Due to COVID and other outer factors, Tinder, Bumble, Hinge and other dating apps became more relevant than ever. Since we know that attention is sex for women, these are ideal tools from them to get that attention from orbiters for free without having to gave away their most valuable asset.

And we know that it isn't their mission. (':

BODY:

There are so many proclaimed experts in their Casanova texting. 

I used to be one of these gents, trying to be witty over the messages. Funny banters and shit. The thing is I would get caught up in their frame. Trying to 'text my way into their pussy'.

Here is what you should do instead and what are the things you should be aware of.

 

1. Womens today actually hang on to their cell phones 24/7. She knows you are there. She knows about your message. She HAS seen it. You are not a priority. Do not dwell on what could have been, do not force the Disneyland thoughts about 'oh she must not have seen it, she likes me' and stuff like that. She GOT THE MESSAGE.
2. Quit chatting shit and faking till you make it. Simple intro, direct to the topic. Men communicate overtly so express what you want. If she shit tests like 'do you really mean that?, are you serious?' confirm and stand your ground. You might as well use agree and amplify.
3. It was always numbers game. Unless your SMV is over the roof 15 out of 20 will just seek attention. By using first two points you cut attention whores and save your most valuable asset.
4. Medium is the message. If you get for example 10 messages (already too much)q and 8 of them is monotonius and 2 of them show some interest, you reciprocate and soft nect in head. Those 2 messages are probably an attention bait to keep you hooked.
5. Do not double text. If she ghosts, she ghosts, next.
6. If she flakes and does not reschedule, hard next.

CONLCUSION:

When 'texting' you should be aware of your most valuable asset. Your time. Do not give it for free. 

Do not give away your attention for free and be aware of Chartiste 2 to 3 rule at all times.

Triple book dates, be bald and DO NOT TRY TO TEXT YOUR WAY INTO THE PUSSY.

Elder contributors had the point from the first minute when they said the texting is just for logistics. You can try to be smart guy and do the opposite but you will probably be outbalded by some other guy who will smack his balls over her pussy while you send a good night text.",91,1

Destroy Your Dick December,"A lot has been written on the topic of No Nut November by the Red Pill and Manosphere as a whole. However, up until now no one has written on the topic of Destroy Your Dick December. Now I know what your thinking. You‚Äôre thinking, Gaylubeoil, You little jokester, Is this one of your silly troll posts? Ha ha! Is this one of your silly jokes? Common let's be serious. The Red Pill is about self improvement. Write about that please. So I can self improve.

And to that I say: Go Fuck Yourself. And I know you will. Because as soon as No Nut November ends your gonna march right into Destroy Your Dick December. In fact No Nut November logically signifies the existence of Destroy Your Dick December. They're like peanut butter and man jelly. Dudes aren't vowing to give up masterbation forever. No! They're saying they're gonna give it up for a month. And at the conclusion of that month their obviously gonna masterbate heavily and Destroy their Dick December.

So basically No Nut November is a giant foreplay month that the manosphere plays with itself and other men. It does this by denying the existence of Destroy Your Dick December, to maintain a veneer of respectability. But in reality if we're really honest with ourselves the whole point of the endeavor is Destroy Your Dick December.

At this point your thinking ha ha neat observation there Gaylubeoil. But what's the point of this? The point of this is that you and most of the manboys here are such degenerate ADHD sacks of shit, that the only way y'all can be taught a new concept is through elaborate masterbation and sodomy metaphores. That's all the dudes here know or understand.

Alright so now that I got you hooked with all of this hilarious pee pee poopie talk I can deliver my brilliant philosophical lesson, before you inevitably get distracted by an internet butt. All communication is comprised of Manifest and Latent content. Manifest is that which is said. Latent is not said, often denied but exists as a logical consequence of the first. Manifest content exists to hide traumatic latent content.

So for example, a while ago there was a post titled: Women Are Wolves In Sheep's Clothing. The latent content is that the author is a sheep. Because logically who else would care about wolves in sheep's clothing? Wolves don't care about wolves in sheep's clothing. They'd probably find the crossdressing wolf hilarious or disgusting. So the guy who wrote Women Are Wolves in Sheep's Clothing subconsciously thinks of himself as a Sheep-Man. That's why he wrote the post. He wanted to reassure himself of his masculinity because he felt like a sheep.

According to Freud's most famous book The Interpretation of Dreams, the purpose of every dream is to keep the sleeper asleep. Sounds simple right? Well in Freud's native German the word dream, can be translated as fantasy desire or wish. Dreams allow people to experience an uncomfortable reality, do nothing and continue the status quo like our Sheep-Man.

In other words uncertainty begets fiction. People hide from difficult Red Pill Truths via Blue Pill fiction. The Department of Defense commissions Hollywood to make war propaganda so that war can be normalized and continue indefinitely. Sheep-men write sheepish treatises to reassure other sheep men. Masturbators wax poetically about No Nut November while counting down the days to Destroy Your Dick December.

Truth can be used to create a lie. By getting you to focus on No Nut November you can be Distracted from Destroy Your Dick December. If you want to to play this Red Pill game you have to learn how to find the glitches in the Matrix. You need to learn to find latent content hidden within official narrative manifest content.

Or not. Be an NPC. Do what everyone else does. Listen to you teachers. Don't ask complicated questions. Don't point out contradictions. Hold out until December. Find yourself some nasty porno and Destroy That Dick.

Breaking out of the shell that's formed around you,"Alright men. We've all been through it and we sit reading day in day out. We should all be improving ourselves in any way possible. But, wait? I know all of this stuff, but I just don't have that 'pop' in me anymore. That energy to allow myself to flow through life, that confidence to have positive engagements with people regardless of what we gain from it.  
  
This is one of the biggest problems in today's society. A higher percentage of people can't even look up while they're talking. Crumble and shell up while talking to strangers, scared of offending them or doing it 'wrong'. It's all in your fucking head. Sure, not everyones an extrovert, but also - not everyone is this much of a fucking pussy.  
  
**What does this 'shell' feel like?**  
  
The biggest thing I had to overcome, even after I got back on that horse, got in the gym daily, built my social circle and standing, started fucking bitches, excelled at work... Was actually the easiest thing to overcome of them all when I truly realised what it was that was wrong with me.  
  
I'd look in the mirror and doubt myself. I'd stand in the shower thinking if I had done a social interaction 'right'. Fuck what's right.  
  
You ever heard the saying ""Don't go looking for Mr. Right. Look for Mr. Right Now.""? From some rom-com. This quote made more and more sense once I got over this.  
  
**Breaking the shell**  
  
It's really fucking simple. Imagine you don't ride a bike for 2 years, the first time you get back on the bike it might feel a little off, but it's always said ‚Äúonce you learn to ride a bicycle, you never forget‚Äù. This is what you're fighting, just getting back on the bike.  
  
I myself, locked myself away for 2 years and while I was working my ass off and I reap the benefits now, I also threw away so many other aspects of my life. So I had 2 years of no proper social interaction, no personal development.  
  
I walked out of the house to go to the store one day and I was in a really good mood. I was singing a song I had in my head out loud, I had people looking at me like I was a fruitloop but nothing was breaking my stride. I smiled and said hello to people, I didn't expect anything from it and therefore wasn't disappointed when my mood wasn't reciprocated.  
  
**Stop fucking caring.**  
  
No ones going to care past the 30 second interaction about what you said or did unless you do or say something totally outlandish, even still, there's never any negative consequence anyway to most shit you say within reason.  
  
Speak to that cashier you see everytime you're in the store. Ask them about their day, remember the small details and bring them up next time you see them.  
  
e.g.:  
""Hey cashier how's life?""  
""Oh you know, as good as it can be. It's been a long day.""  
""It's been a long day? How long have you worked?""  
""X other person called in sick so I'm on back to back 6 hours""  
""Damn, 12 hours. That's awful. Anyhow, I gotta go, see you again.""  
  
Then the next time you go in:  
""Hey cashier, they haven't got you working those long shifts again have they?""  
  
You know what that cost you? Absolutely nothing. What do you gain? Experience talking to someone outside of a fucking screen. It's not about that though - remember a key teaching: *Outcome independence*  
  
Now build yourself back up. I must reiterate something plastered in the sidebar content: Talk to *everybody*, or anybody.  
  
Break out of your shell and gain that pop back. This works on women, this works socially, this works professionally. Being able to look someone dead in the eyes and speak confidently about absolute meaningless shit is how you interact with people to build rapport.  
  
[Watch this scene from Gran Torino. This is a live example of it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74I7Nl1mKig) Great movie by the way about becoming a man.  
  
Do this every day and you eventually get over that looming fear of talking to people goes away. You have less thoughts of 'Did I do this right?' and for the times when you do. Stop giving a fuck. It really doesn't matter. I don't know how many times this needs to be said here but if you're really trying to build an interpersonal relationship with someone and you have to tiptoe around what you say, are they worth even having around anyway? No. Absolutely not, go next.  
  
**TLDR;**  
Stop giving a fuck  
Talk to everyone  
Read the fucking sidebar again if any of this is new to you.",27,1
TESTOSTERONE- THE MALE HORMONE,"The following post is not mine 


In this thread I will present to you ultimate redpill on how to increase and optimize your natural testosterone production.

So the methods that I will discuss to increase masculinity are as follows:
Environment
Diet
Habits
Routine
Supplements

0:INTRODUCTION-
The average young 20 year old man of today possess testosterone levels of 679ng/dl, back in the 1920s the average 20 year old man, possessed testosterone levels of 911ng/dl.
Such levels back then are considered top 7-8% today which is not optimal at all.
Today gentleman, I'm going to help you and tell you how to improve your natural testosterone production.
Forget what modern, out of shape doctors say on the matter. After all, those same doctors consider 350ng/dl testosterone levels to be normal for young men of today.
1:ENVIRONMENT-
The most powerful way to increase testosterone production is with the help from the sun. Humans can only absorb vit. D and metabolise it trough direct sun exposure, all animal sources contain insignificant amounts of vit. D.
The average adult male needs about 20 000UI of vit. D daily in order to function optimally and to be free out of any disease.
Your body requires vit. D in order to produce testosterone....

I sent that text to just give you guys an idea, the full thread is linked below I've looked up some of the shit he typed and it seems legit, I didn't know these things so I thought I'd help those who also dont know and thats pretty much it

[field report] my ex is now obese with several cats and dogs. tragic.,"jesus that really sucked to see. we were technically fuck buddies for like 6 month in her early 20s. she had some mileage on her and she wasn‚Äôt thinking by any means ‚Äî but she was def v attractive. she had a couple suitors at the time trying to lock her down but I was still fucking her (gross in retrospect).

I was still beta (i like to assume still am) and considered ltr with her so I put her up to a test (weight loss, academia) and she failed to live up to my expectations so I left her. turns out she wasn‚Äôt able to keep the other guys either.

she cried and claimed that she knew from the bottom of her heart that she would never find someone like me again - and that I was ‚Äúthe one that got away‚Äù and she‚Äôd always compare every guy she met to me. looking back, idk what I was doing with her for so long ‚Äî what a dumbass I was. but that‚Äôs in retrospect. I thought that I would never find another girl - but really there‚Äôs no problem with that so it was a phenomenal gamble.

anyhow, I checked her tiktok cause I got famous on there for my physique thirst traps and I know she‚Äôs watched my stuff and I was curious to see how she‚Äôs doing.

she‚Äôs got a couple cats and two dogs, lives with another girl, and is obese. like what people say happens to high n-count girls when they get older. but it does suck seeing that happen - she even got her hair died and more tats. I truly had hoped her the best, a good husband etc but wygd.

I guess the takeaway is that I was skeptical of the old timers here that say worthless whores get fat with a bunch of cats and I guess anecdotally I can see it now. I always assumed it was an last an exaggeration - but her tits look like hello pancakes. heart wrenching.

personal-thoughts:

you know, if life truly is this tragic by default for most girls after 25, then I can see how it would be extremely easy for them to want to how out when they have a powerful smv like th eh do when they‚Äôre young. hell, I would do the same. if you were made a king for 5 years, would you really have a queen for five years or fuck the hottest queens for 4 years and then settle for one the last year? you guys hate on women like it‚Äôs their fault etc but it‚Äôs just the way we‚Äôve been conditioned and our culture.

I personally think this sub is too biased about girls and all negativities (like me calling them whores) are misplaced. you should be disinterested in them rather than coming from a place on animosity.",69,1

Sub communication: the evolutionary psychology behind it and 5 ways guys in relationships FAIL at it,"**Act 1: Nature is weird.**

**Part A.) Evolved proficiency in the non-verbal**¬†

If you believe the history books that ancient Sumeria was the first civilization with language, that means humans have been around for 400,000 years but only formally speaking for \~5,000 years.¬†

Like much of evolutionary psychology, this is going to be a case of people navigating modern times using a brain developed for navigating the jungle. Genetics evolve slower than culture, and brains and biology haven‚Äôt quite caught up to the generational fluctation.

Humans are unique from other animals in that they evolved by successfully collaborating with other humans, favoring brain processes hardwired for ‚Äúcooperation‚Äù, such as [mirror neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron) , [mere exposure effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect)  and [cheater detection module](https://www.cep.ucsb.edu/papers/cheatdetect_ermer_ld_jt2007.pdf).¬†

This tribe altruism allowed for [specialization of labor](https://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/specialization-labor-9939.html), where men could hunt and woman could make homes, and as long as you were good at getting along in a group then you had cooked meat to eat and protection from predators.¬†

Success of the individual was predicated on a.) inclusion of a group and b.) the success of that group.

So humans evolved having to depend on each other in groups, but much like the rest of the animal kingdom without a language, they had to get pretty good at communicating using things other than words - body language and gestures.¬†

**Part B.) Social Contract**¬†

Dominance hierarchies exist in nature so that in these groups, before we could express boundaries and expectations in a written word, people knew their place and behaved in a way that reduces intra-group conflict.¬†

This is basic stuff, but generally the ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äù of the group is the best hunter and has the most access to mates, and earns this right as he is also primarily responsible for physical protection of the group. People lower on the totem pole trade their subordinance to the alpha for food and protection.¬†

If everybody in a group plays their role, this is a mutually beneficial way to coexist. The alpha can let his guard down within the group knowing he won‚Äôt have to won‚Äôt have to fight for his status, and the people lower on the pole feel secure in his leadership.¬†

If somebody behaved in a way detrimental to the group, they risk being lowered on the dominance hierarchy to the point of ostracization, so it is ingrained human nature to maintain status quo and go along with the role handed to you.

This is called [playing along with the social contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_hierarchy#Subordinance) (Highly recommend reading this whole page for better background on this)

Exclusion from the group likely means death - This is why children have a physiological reaction to being bullied or unliked. Modern man is obsessed with reputation and how they appear to other people, because their ancestors lives depended on it.¬†

This is also why men have a physiological response in fear of approaching girls: if only the alpha male has mating access rights, and behavior detrimental to your place in the group meant death, then guys who do not feel like an alpha male will feel uncomfortable expressing their sexuality around women.

Conversely, this means guys who do feel entitled to sex with women must be the alpha male of their group.¬†

The human gestation period of 9 months is the second longest in the animal kingdom behind elephants, so women must be selective about whom they mate with. This investment is large on her part so it is important the genes are good. It is also important they are mating with someone high status who will ensure their protection, as they will be unable to provide food or escape prey for these 9 months and a few months after.

So it is mutual: only the alpha male may be sexually forward, and women only want to mate with the alpha male.¬†

Before times of social media and urbanization, humans generally only knew the same 20-50 people in their life time and these people knew your whole history. You couldn‚Äôt lie about your status, or ‚Äúfake it til you make it‚Äù as everybody in your tribe knew everything about you.¬†

You couldn‚Äôt just wake up one day and act out of place on the heirarchy (I.e. feel entitled to sex and approach girls), you would be reprimanded for it and your existence depends on inclusion in the group.¬†

Fast forward to 2020 where men and women are still living with brains hardwired for these days, it‚Äôs no wonder why most men are afraid to approach women and women are attracted to men that show forwardness and confidence.¬†

By having an attitude of willingness to engage a female boldly and sexually, you are hacking her brain and subcommunicating much about you and your value already without you having to say a word.¬†

This is a nonverbal ‚ÄúSubcommunication‚Äù that you are an alpha and there for worthy of mating with.¬†

**Part 3: Venus and Mars**

Intragender communication is drenched in these types of ‚ÄúSub-communication‚Äù, and while almost 100% of women are inherently fluent and native speakers of sub-communication, (their reproductive screening process is heavily predicated on it) a large percentage of guys have no idea it even exists.

As alluded to in the section about women‚Äôs selectivity: Woman and men have different mating strategies. Women focus on quality and men focus on quantity. If a man sees a good enough looking female, he is usually willing to mate with her without much personality screening at all since his minimum investment in the child is the 1-20 minutes that it took to create it.¬†

Men, as a byproduct, have very different brains when it comes to being attracted to a mate and often the only subcommunication process involved is a visual one screening for fertility. This is quick, binary and non-nuanced. (Does she meet my threshold of youth, symmetry and hip:waist ratio, etc?)

Because of this, men are often mystified by the actual process of attracting females and how it could boil down to more than physical looks.¬†

Of course, being visually attractive still helps. Being tall and muscular does subcommunicate genetic fitness to girls (likelihood their child performs well on the dominance heirarchy and becomes an alpha) so you can build on a case of subcommunicating alphaness through building muscle, but this is a secondary requisite to dominant personality traits.¬†

**Act 2: Programmed to Fail**

Besides the obvious advice of being muscular and sexually forward that is frequently recommended here, some men still need a more detailed roadmap of how to navigate sub communications.¬†

Albert Mehrabian says in his 1971 book Silent Messages that words spoken are only 7% of communication (I personally think this seems too little, if you think about great speeches they are more than only 7% as¬† good as the words spoken in them, but I digress) https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-use-the-7-38-55-rule-to-negotiate-effectively#what-is-the-73855-rule.¬†

Every statement and behavior has a surface level meaning, but the recipient of the message now also has a subcurrent of deeper inferences about your status or lifestyle implied by your behavior sample.¬†

How to use this to your advantage?

Observed behaviors can often trigger unconscious responses that give clues to deeper impressions about one‚Äôs objective value in the ‚ÄúSexual marketplace‚Äù. A good deal of sexual communication is covert.¬†

[Hardwired biological ‚ÄòCues‚Äô do happen in nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaas_Tinbergen#Supernormal_stimulus), where animals unconsciously always follow a behavorial script in response to a certain stimulus. This also works in human mating, but not like most guys think. More on that later.

# ‚ÄúWhat gets us into trouble is not what we don't know. It's what we know for sure that just ain't so.‚Äù

‚Äï **Mark Twain**

A lot of what we believe we know about nature is counter intuitive. As men we were programmed from a young age by movies and TV that being a loyally obedient slave to a pretty girl for long enough will make her magically want to be with you.

Seeing the same script time and again, the patient kind reserved character loyally waits for the girl to be done with all of the ‚ÄúJerks‚Äù, and in the end earns romantic attention with the target of his interests by exhibiting friendly and supportive behavior for long enough.

This ‚Äúaiming to please‚Äù behavior is subcommunicated to men through movies and tv as a suitable way to attract a mate, so lots of men unconsciously mimic the strategy.¬†

This does actually trigger a reciprocal behavior cue in women, but unfortunately for most men it is not unwavering affection and mindblowing sex, but rather psychological recategorization to ‚Äúfriend‚Äù or ‚Äúprovider‚Äù zone. This friend zone usually involves a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù carrot dangled in front of his face, to keep him investing in her with the implication that maybe one day she will pick him as a passionate sexual partner.¬†

Traditionally dependent on men for resources for thousands of years as hunter gatherers, women have evolved to find security in a reasonable expectation that men will support them.

Modern day women play this carrot dangling game as a way to feel secure in their survival. They engineer these relationships so that they have a cast of men who ‚Äúorbit‚Äù them like a star. They keep them close enough to be in the gravitational pull but never actually colliding.¬†

The scope of the evolutionary biology section of this post does not extend into ‚ÄúAlpha Fucks/Beta Bucks‚Äù, but there is an observed dualistic mating strategy observed in primates and anecdotally in humans.¬†

Women have two motives for using sex.

1. Primal: In an intimate reproductive urge to obtain genes from a partner. Passion and horniness.

2. Transactional: in a survivalist exchange to obtain resources from a partner. Female Bonobos will trade sex for food, and women will marry rich men they are not sexually attracted to.

Despite what movies and tv shows tell you, when men are overly nice to women in hopes of courting her romantically, women instinctively realize there is an attempt to iniate a ‚Äúfavor for sex‚Äù contract.¬†

A misperceived mating cue, an eagerness to transactionally exchange favors for sex may subcommunicate to the female that a man wants sex but has a lack of confidence in his sexuality + forwardness. (Remember earlier. This = not an alpha) For genetics sake, and she will deem him not a a suitable partner for primal sex and only consider sex with him in a transactional setting.¬†

Aside from biology, a few other reasons this fails.

1. This is non-congruent behavior. Like how Ghandi said he would never try to achieve peace by war, and you should never try to grow an apple tree by planting an orange seed, you should not try to use supplicating friendship to achieve a sexual relationship.
2. When you overtly put effort in to try to attract somebody, you become dependent on the outcome. You focus on things you can‚Äôt control and you start acting weird. Everyone can imagine the experience of trying too hard to get someone to like you and having it not work. Most people can also recall the inverse, a situation where you were indifferent to somebody and naturally they gravitate towards you. Even the subcommunication of an ‚ÄúAttempted Pursuit‚Äù implies the pursuer believes they have something to gain from their relationship to their pursuant, and this puts the Pursuant in a position of power. Indifference makes the difference.

Beyond being nice and resource providing, movies and TV shows also promote bragging to girls, or attempting to win them over with material goods, accolades, or accomplishments.¬†

This is called ‚ÄúQualifying‚Äù yourself and it also falls under the ‚ÄúSubcommunicating low value‚Äù umbrella.

Basically, the thought is that if you have to convince someone how amazing you are, you must not believe that the product is good enough to be sold without salesmanship.

This ‚Äútrying too hard‚Äù makes it seem like you have not had success with women in the past, and if previous women who have had the time to determine if you were worthy of mating decided you were not a suitable partner, then she should save time and just trust other people‚Äôs researched judgement.

This ‚Äúsocial proof‚Äù (or lack thereof) subcommunication creates a knee jerk reaction in all people to heuristically assign value to things without subjective appraisal. You see it everywhere. ‚ÄúEveryone is wearing these shoes, they must be cool.‚Äù Or the election day special, ‚ÄúEveryone hates this politician, he must suck!‚Äù

Beyond these obvious programming of meta male-female behaviors that produce unfavorable subcommunications, modern entertainment promotes many popular tropes and micro-actions that seem like a good way to get girls but actually subcommunicate low mating value to her.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

**Act 3.) Modern sub communication in practice**

I will now break down a few examples of these counter intuitive games, and identify the difference between the intended communication by the male and the actual communication achieved.¬†

**1.) Give it away.** Asking to be exclusive bf/gf too soon

***Intended communication behind action:***¬†

Romantic gesture, ‚ÄúI like you a lot‚Äù, I‚Äôm a good guy who‚Äôs looking for a relationship.¬†

***Programmed expected response:*** With the premise that girls want a good guy who‚Äôs looking for a relationship, acting like you want to rush into monogamy will increase a girls attraction to you.

***Reality:*** Implies lack of other options, implies lack of social proof, implies low value.

A deep dive into the sex/commitment trade between male and female across primate evolution shows that high value men traditionally prefer multiple female sex partners (see: Harems) and do not feel the need to initiate an exclusive relationship in order to have sex.

An over eagerness to commit implies no other options, and if it seems very sudden or undeserved, it makes a girl wonder why. Our logical minds are often skeptical of too good to be true situations. ‚ÄúCan I do better?‚Äù Her subconscious wonders.¬†

***Correct course of action:*** Hang out with girl, have fun and have sex. Do not talk about exclusivity first at all. She will bring it up when she is ready.

Let her chase you and earn your commitment, she will enjoy the relationship more feeling like she had worked for it.

To play into the sex/commitment trade off (Men are the gatekeepers of commitment and women are the gatekeepers of sex. Men trade commitment for sex, women trade sex for commitment), this is an analogous argument to the idea that girls should withhold sex until marriage and ‚Äúmake you work for it‚Äù and then you‚Äôll value her more. ‚ÄúWhy buy the cow when you can have the milk for free?‚Äù¬†

In accounting, it you don‚Äôt know how to properly value an asset, you just price it at the cost of acquisition. A girl will value your commitment with direct proportionality to how hard she had to work to obtain it.

Saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù first or too early is a sub umbrella of this. A woman wants to feel like she has earned your love after relentless chasing, and will not value it if you‚Äôre eager to give it away.

Side note: Being said, rules are meant to be broken and you should never be afraid of rejection. if you‚Äôre absolutely secure in your relationship and are a romantic guy and want to enter monogamy and express your love verbally, by all means do so. A confident declaration of passion for a girl can be a fun memory for the both of you later in life. Just don‚Äôt be a Sucker For Love and do it for the sake of doing it, or worse because you feel like it‚Äôs going to make you seem more attractive, because it‚Äôs not.

**2.) Being afraid to disagree/break rapport**

***Intended communication behind action:*** I agree with you, we have similar viewpoints and I respect you.¬†

***Programmed expected response:*** She will think we are more compatible now and therefore like me more.

***Reality:*** if guy is afraid to disagree, ‚ÄúSomething to lose‚Äù implies low value. non-masculine. Girls want a guy who says what he wants, is not afraid to dissent from group. They want a risk taker and a firm decision maker who is ready at all times, just incase they don‚Äôt feel like making any.

***Correct course of action:*** Be yourself but don‚Äôt overly agree with her on every point because you think you‚Äôre building rapport. Your lack of polarity is making you boring.

This fear of disagreeability subcommunicates a being afraid to dissent from a group. Someone afraid to speak his mind is someone who feels obligated to be agreeable for status and protection, so likely not an alpha.

In a time where groupthink and [social cascades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_cascade) are at an all time high, and echo chamber social media sites like Reddit and Twitter tell you what the only appropriate talking points are, there is a too familiar comfort in being agreeable and a discomfort in the tension involved with breaking script.

**\*Tangent on Tension and Shit Tests\***

Imagine you‚Äôre out at a bar and out of nowhere a 500 pound body builder seems ready to kill you. He gets in your face, stares you in the eyes and slowly says in a menacing way

 *‚ÄúWhat did you say to me?‚Äù*

Imagine holding eye contact with him for 10 seconds, silent with a scorn on your face.

Imagine how quick you‚Äôd want to diffuse it, as a natural reaction.

 *‚ÄúWhat? No i didn‚Äôt say anything‚Äù*

You'd probably say it quickly and panicked too. Your subconscious concession just to let him know where you stand on the idea of confrontation with him.

Now imagine a hot girl eyes you from across the room. She comes over to you slowly, gets right up in your face, stares you in the eyes and slowly says: 

*‚ÄúDo you wanna fuck me?‚Äù*

Imagine how quick you‚Äôd defuse the tension and say something.

Imagine holding eye contact for 10 seconds and not saying anything, with a smirk on your face.

Tension is a necessary phase for many human interactions, attraction included. Many guys think they can bypass this by being agreeable.

A girl will purposefully (and often times subconciously) test a mans strength by creating tension to see how he responds to it. A man who cannot handle tension with a 115 pound girl probably can‚Äôt handle it with a 300 pound man, so by seeing how he reacts to these situations she can test whether or not he would have been an ‚Äúalpha‚Äù in the group thousands of years ago.

These tension creations are commonly referred to as ‚ÄúShit tests.‚Äù

Sometimes girls will feign disgust towards you, just to see what you‚Äôre made of.

Shit tests are beyond the scope of this post, but they actually are a good thing. They subcommunicate that you are engaging woman‚Äôs reproductive screening process. (Women don‚Äôt shit test homeless guys.)¬†

They want to see how you crack under pressure. The best way to fail a shit test is to take it seriously.¬†

Speaking of shit tests, a lot of this conditioning from society can be looked at as one massive scale shit test from feminist america. What‚Äôs to be gained from telling a generation of men ‚Äúit‚Äôs quirky and cute when guys are nervous and passive‚Äù and the ‚Äúbe a nice guy, don‚Äôt be a fuckboy‚Äù?¬†

It weeds out leaders from followers. Men who were born to be subordinate will go along and orbit, and men who were born to be leaders will differentiate themselves and be easily identified to be fucked.

This shit test is responsible for the recent ‚ÄúConsent‚Äù rabbit hole we've gotten into, where girls will be a feminist marching in the streets, saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt objectify me!!‚Äù and then go home and cum 10 times on a guy who chokes her and spits in her mouth.

(Obviously consent is important, and legitimate rape is horrible, but you should read a few pages from women‚Äôs erotica if you want to know how they actually want to be treated in the bedroom.)

The next example has to do with this certain trope. I generally see movie/TV conditioning with this one in things targeted towards teens, but it still seeps into their subconscious.

**3.) Being a pussy:** this is an obvious one, but I mean it. By not pulling the trigger when its time to make a move, or asking for the date when a conversation has reached that point. Fear of forwardness -&gt; implies low status.

Like asking a girl to kiss, or asking if you can touch her boobs in bed.

***Intended communication behind action:*** I respect you as a woman and value feminism and consent

***Programmed expected response:*** She will be more attracted to me knowing that I'm respectful and ideologically align with feminism

***Reality:*** Afraid of rejection, has no experience, lack of social proof and dominance lead her to infer you are low on the totem pole, dont feel deserving of love in your masculine aura so you‚Äôre resorting to seeking love from your feminine aura, and therefor she thinks you have bad genes and doesn‚Äôt wanna fuck you

Oftentimes, guys with this one will have massive issues with self sexuality. They are male apologists.¬†

If ever in a situation where sexual tension occurs they will self eject, blowing up a situation on purpose so they can take ownership of rejection.

I have a particular Dispicable blue pill example of a friend. He‚Äôs a big CNN liberal and feminist, virgin at 26.

We went to community college together, and there was an abundance of hot girls just sitting around there, so my biggest hobby at the time became day gaming in the cafeteria. Normal shit, see a girl sitting alone, go up and say ""Hey I thought you were cute and wanted to meet you."" Cheesy but it was 2014 and worked more often than not.

Anyways, one time he sees me sitting with a girl, and comes over and sit with us. Me and the girl were already having a sexuality charged convo, we were talking about erogenous zones we like kissed, and she asked his input as to where he liked to be kissed? He shamefully looked away and nervously said ‚Äúi like pizza.‚Äù Trying to be ‚Äúquirky and random‚Äù but he self ejected as a sexual candidate due his own feelings of inferiority. Like lawyers, when they start losing in a case and feel inferior, adopt a stance of [‚Äúfig leafing‚Äù](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig_leaf), covering their genitals. Communicating such a low sexual status that they prefer girls not think of them as sexual vehicles at all.¬†

**4.) They get needy and over text/call.** Reaching out constantly because they are insecure and think relationships operate on a linear communication scale. (Amount of text exchanged = quality of relationship.) Don‚Äôt understand the concept of ‚Äúabsence makes the heart grow fonder.‚Äù Text messages are like cakes. They take a couple hours to bake sometimes, so don‚Äôt always reply right away. It would be like taking a cake out of the oven too early.

***Intended communication behind action:*** I‚Äôm thinking about you, I want to talk to you, I‚Äôm consistent.

*Programmed expected response:* She will be more attracted to me knowing that I like her, and our constant talking will build rapport and closeness. Amount of communication is linearly correlated with strength of relationship.

***Reality:*** no mystery, no chase, no wondering. [Girls are scientifically more attracted to guys when they are unsure how they feel.](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110207142623.htm?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News%29)

**5.) They make gf their therapist. Overshare problems and complain constantly**

***Intended communication behind action:*** I value you as an equal and friend and want to vent about things that are impacting me

***Programmed expected response:*** She will be attracted to my vulnerability, we will get closer, and girls say they love guys with emotions and sensitive side.

***Reality:*** She thinks you‚Äôre bad vibes and subconsciously not fit to be a father of her children because you‚Äôre easily frazzled. Dry panties.

They say you can have your GF be your GF or your therapist, but she can‚Äôt play both roles well. Imagine having a draining parent that always wants to complain to you. Thats how a girl feels when you complain about your problems to her. She wants you to be a good vibes leader.

**In conclusion**

Anyways gents. The point here is not to get you constantly over thinking about subcommunication, because overthinking is the stem of most of these problems in the first place, but if you‚Äôve never thought of the concept before and you can't seem to tell where you‚Äôre going wrong with girls, this might be a good place to start.¬†

Be honest with yourself. Look for ways you could be unconsciously projecting low quality behavior. [The shadow psyche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology)) finds ways to manifest and leak into the present, so if you have preconceived notions of low self esteem or [self limiting beliefs](https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-are-self-limiting-beliefs--cms-31607)  about woman and their attitudes towards you, and you may be projecting that onto your partner without even realizing it.¬†

Women are naturally more socially/emotionally perceptive than men can even comprehend. Evolutionarily, as the physically inferior sex, woman have relied on cunning to ensure their survival for thousands of years. More on that in a later post. But the point is: when your vibe is off,¬† and you‚Äôre feeling low value, a girl can smell it a mile away even if you think you‚Äôre hiding it.

So while it is important to appear relaxed and confident to subcommunicate sexual worthiness, it is equally important to actually live a lifestyle that makes you feel relaxed and confident. This means socializing, exercising, reading, and meditation, while cutting back on things that waste time and make you feel shameful like masterbating, drugs, junk food, and video games.¬†

TL:DR Be muscular, sexually forward, and indifferent towards women. Make sure you‚Äôre subcomminicating masculinity and perceived self worth.",50,1

"My Democrat client who vented to me for months about his hatred toward Trump, voted for Trump today as a ‚Äúgift‚Äù to an ex who ghosted him to ‚Äúwipe the slate clean.‚Äù","First off: Although this post revolves around politics, this is not a political post.

I am a self-employed personal trainer. One of my clients is a single man in his mid-50‚Äôs who has been married and divorced multiple times (twice I believe) and has also had several girlfriends throughout his life; I know this because he mentions at least one of them during every workout. All of these women dumped him. His most recent ex-wife is actually one of my clients as well, he speaks so highly of her and mentions her the most, asking me how she‚Äôs been and if she‚Äôs still working out. Her on the other hand, has never mentioned him once; and the one time his name got brought up into the conversation it got a bit awkward and I could tell she wanted to change the subject.

Over the past few months, this client has been vocal to me about his Democratic political stance, as well as how much he dislikes Trump. He always tells me about how he can‚Äôt wait for him to get out of office, how he‚Äôs a liar, bully, and overall ‚Äúbad‚Äù person. He also had been reminding me to vote over the past couple weeks, stating how important it is and how much he believes every vote counts. 

Fast forward to today: My client mentions one of the women who my he dated (possibly decades ago) who apparently dumped him and then ghosted him. As he and I were training today, on election day, he tells me that he got in touch with her over the weekend and proposed a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù to her. 

His deal was: He would vote for Trump, as long as he and her able to ‚Äúwipe their slate clean,‚Äù aka just be on good terms again....

....

WTF. I was extremely baffled, and it took every bit of professionalism in me to not burst out and go nuts. This is the same man who expressed his hatred toward Trump every 2/3 sessions, calling him a ‚Äúbully,‚Äù ‚Äúliar,‚Äù you name it. 

‚ÄúLet me get this straight, you voted against who you actually want to win, just so that you can be on good terms with a woman who dumped you and chose to never speak to you again?‚Äù I asked him.

To which he responded trying to convince me that it was more of a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù to ‚Äúwipe the slate clean‚Äù or some nonsense. I was so heated and taken back, I told him that she probably doesn‚Äôt appreciate what he did, and without thinking enough about what I was saying, I said ‚Äúshe was probably laughing at the fact you did that.‚Äù To which he got defensive for a split second so we ceased that conversation there and changed the topic.

The fact that this grown man values being on good terms with a woman who dumped him, MORE than his vote, is what completely made me flip out internally; especially since he had vocalized to me multiple times how much he cares about this specific election period and how much he wants to get Trump out of office. 

This man pulled the ultimate simp move on election day.

TLDR: My Democrat client voted for Trump just to please his Republican ex-girlfriend and be on good terms with her again.",43,1

I havent had sex with this woman for six months and quite frankly I'm not missing it. Her pussy aint worth it and when she does put out shes on her back and motionless. She hasn't shaved her snatch in god knows how long. I havent had a blow job for at least 5 years...thats not true she did it a few years back for about 30 seconds...... I'm really getting tired of her fucking antics and truth be told I'm hoping she would monkey branch to the next man so I have an excuse to hit the nuke button.

Election Day Discussion,"#[Election Day 2020 Tribe](https://www.trp.red/feed/t/2020)

Since we tend to try to keep US politics mostly off the sub unless it directly relates to sexual strategy, I figured there may be a desire for red pill folks to connect on the topic of the election.

It's hard to discuss important topics with likeminded individuals when there are no avenues to do so. 

Join our Election Day 2020 Tribe and join in our predictions and follow along with discussion of what happens tonight and for the rest of the week. 

Discussion about this is most likely going to be expressly banned from Reddit, as it is from Twitter and Facebook. (This should scare you)

I believe entire communities will be up on the chopping block for allowing uncensored discussion on who tonights winner is or is not.

Because of this, we are locking the discussion here, but feel free to participate:

Weak Foundations,"&amp;#x200B;

A nice house built on a weak foundation is still a weak house.

&amp;#x200B;

# Intro

There remains an undercurrent of guys who are red on the surface, but have a blue core. (My local village uncle, uncle Vas, classifies these people as red oreos). And its understandable...to an extent.

&amp;#x200B;

Unlike PUA or r Seduction which just consists of betas/bloopies who just want to learn some cool alpha tricks whilst still holding onto their normative beliefs, pre-conceived notions of women, sexual strategy and want to ""respect wahmen"", the Red Pill totally rejects the narrative in an uncompromising way. It demands you forget everything you know, replace it with a totally new perspective and it certainly does not cater to anyone's fee-fees. However, this creates a problem as it's easier to learn about shit tests, learn that lifting is good for you than it is changing your entire meta of how you see women, what to expect from them and how you approach sexual strategy as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

**To truly understand red pill, you must first nuke your blue pill foundations.** Anything less is just promoting building on a weak foundation, so anything built on that, is probably going to be just as weak or at best subpar. The Red Pill is **not** something you just sprinkle onto yourself. It is YOU. And you are IT. This is why its hard to fully grasp it, and why there are those holding onto their blue ideals but want a red surface. That won't work.

&amp;#x200B;

**You must destroy everything blue and THEN build.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Body:

1. **Your ideal woman, whatever that is, is STILL a woman. Still susceptible to the same laws. So, be careful projecting what your ideal woman should be like and what she should accept.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She will still respond to the same things as a normal woman would, and finds similar things just as repulsive. She will have the same exploits, programming, and functionality of that tinder hoe from last night.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a post detailing how you should never let a woman see you as weak, and it was disappointing to see a top comment suggesting that his ideal woman would somehow go AGAINST human nature and let him be open and vulnerable to her and somehow not find it unattractive. Women don't want to see a man weak. You showing weakness is screaming to her: **""You chose an unworthy mate"".**

&amp;#x200B;

She's already anxious for 1 million tiny and dumb things, the last thing she wants is to get anxious over what is supposed to be her rock. Rocks don‚Äôt show weakness. Rocks don't bleed. If something is up, seek literally anyone else OTHER than a woman. A close friend, a sibling, a parent, a mentor, a therapist, asktrp (only if you promise not to be a sperg) etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Your ideal woman, whatever that is, is just as susceptible to human nature just like any other woman, and just like you. You cannot project the ideal that somehow she will go against her nature. It is biologically engrained for women to want men a certain way, and for men to want women a certain way.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, there will be some variance, I might order [these girls](https://i0.wp.com/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/victorias-secret-fashion-show.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;ssl=1) differently to you. I may prefer blondes, you may prefer brunettes, but nobody here would say any of these girls are ugly. My 2/10 will never be your 10/10 and vice versa. For example, any man who says [this](https://www.redbrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/october-2018-main-print-1535466784.jpg) or [this](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d6539ca3fb48b9d4854ae1972302328d43c512b/0_149_4455_2673/master/4455.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;s=9efbbf9c1a4ceb3086a620ad50f3e772) is attractive, we would all question him.

&amp;#x200B;

Why?

&amp;#x200B;

Men, just like women, are biologically programmed to want their partners a certain way. Asking a woman to accept a man being weak is like asking a man to accept a fat ugly feminist dance theory professor.

&amp;#x200B;

Women are like house cats, all of these cats individually are different but they all operate similarly, they all respond to similar things. They still have the same programming. So, when you find yourself talking about your ideal woman, ask yourself, ""Am I asking her to go against her nature?""

&amp;#x200B;

Eg:

&amp;#x200B;

\- I dont want her be addicted to social media.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I dont want her to be addicted to drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I dont want her to be needy/really jealous.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I want her to cook for me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Versus**:

&amp;#x200B;

\- I want her to let me put on some weight during the LTR and still be attracted to me.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I want to be able to lose frame with her sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I want her to accept me being vulnerable, I want to open up to her without compromising on her attraction.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I want to let myself go and make her fall in love with my personality.

&amp;#x200B;

See which set requires women to go against their nature?

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Girls are sex objects. They are meant for fun, they are meant to de-stress your life.**

&amp;#x200B;

They are not your mother, your partner/equal (how can a woman demand to be your equal when she wants someone smarter, taller, bigger and richer than her? ) nor your political debate buddy. Nor do they want to be. Make sure you are looking for the right things in a girl, don't look for ""can I debate her politically"" or ""does she like marvel films"". Politics for women is entertainment.

&amp;#x200B;

[Women do not have political opinions.](https://www.forums.red/p/TheRedPill/107408/women_do_not_have_political_opinions)

&amp;#x200B;

They just mirror whatever their friends/family/close males say. They are way more susceptible to herd think than males, they lack testosterone and so are WAY less likely to take risks such as thinking contrary to the herd. Being outcasted from the herd is literally death for a woman. Similar thing for a man, but less so. At least he could defend himself until he found a new tribe, a woman alone in the wild is as good as dead. I'm sure some of you with LTR or even FWBs can also attest to how as the relationship progresses, the girl starts mirroring the same opinions/sentiments as you even if they never believed in such things and were maybe even against them. Can you blame them for this? Is this wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

No, that's just their nature.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't take their political opinions seriously, they are just naive little girls parroting what they hear whether its from their friends, media or Apollo, a \[redacted\] with anti-\[redacted\] tendencies. Learn to enjoy women for what they are, their femininity, their childlike mannerisms, their bodies, their youth.

&amp;#x200B;

You are meant to have fun with them. They want to have fun with you. They don't want to engage in political debates, nor do you. So why bother? Most people won't change their minds anyway. I've tried/maybe still am trying to Redpill a fairly liberal friend and it's not very fun nor easy.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't try to seek the masculine from the feminine. ([Mandatory reading](https://archive.is/cz8Ir), also HIGHLY recommend reading all of u/Archwinger 's posts).

&amp;#x200B;

Girls are primarily **for sex**. Girls are primarily **sex**. So, let's keep it that way.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Sexual strategy is amoral and a zero sum game.**

&amp;#x200B;

Amoral...not immoral.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the difference?

&amp;#x200B;

Amoral is not considering morals into the equation, immoral is factoring them in and doing what you wanted regardless. It's like business, you do not consider the morals of doing a deal, you only consider the practicality of it. You consider what you gain and what you lose. That doesn't mean you need to be raging bull destroying everything in your path, but it does mean you put yourself first. Always.

&amp;#x200B;

Why?

&amp;#x200B;

Because that's exactly what women will be doing. Do not let people try to moralise your dating strategy. Girls are definitely **not** thinking of morals when it comes to their strategy. Remember:

&amp;#x200B;

You owe them nothing. They owe you nothing. A girl is perfectly allowed to walk away and so are you.

&amp;#x200B;

YOU get to decide if you want to fuck a girl with a boyfriend or not. You are not responsible for upholding the contract between her and her boyfriend. She has her own agency to do what she wishes, as do you. Whether you choose to do any of this (or not) should less be a question of morals, but more so practicality. If the girl's boyfriend is your long time best friend, then you may want to consider that. Further reading on amorality of sexual strategy (don't want to write too much on this since this topic has definitely been written about before, its just that it may need some refreshing on):

&amp;#x200B;

\- [https://archive.is/G62qB](https://archive.is/G62qB) . Read this comment thread by u/RedPillSchool. Sums it up pretty well.

\- Look up ""amoral"" on the search bar and you'll find more detailed posts, a couple of notables ones were by illimitable man.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sexual strategy is zero sum.**

&amp;#x200B;

You only got laid because someone else didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

You only fucked that girl because you didn't fuck someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

A 8/10 girl only exists because a 2/10 one exists. To have a girl 3 points above average, you need a girl 3 points below average.

&amp;#x200B;

You are only in the top 20% because a bottom 80% exists.

&amp;#x200B;

Your lifting only increases your SMV, because others do not. If everyone looked like [Zyzz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnu2Z0nrdxE) (RIP sick kunt), nobody would actually be a Zyzz and nobody would have a SMV advantage in this sense.

&amp;#x200B;

Your game only works because others do not have any/have a subpar one.

&amp;#x200B;

Alpha fucks only exist because beta bucks exist and vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

All equations are balanced.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. You cannot be a liberal and also red pilled. They are opposites.**

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm not going to tell you what you CAN politically believe in because:

&amp;#x200B;

A) There are more politically versed guys on that.

&amp;#x200B;

B) Most of you just want to get your dicks wet, most of you are not at the stage thinking very critically about politics....yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Wasn‚Äôt there a *Neo* from this sub who suggested that the red pill and the manosphere at large is simply a *Reaction* to shitty politics causing lost and troubled men to seek help and answers in *Safe*spaces online? And didn't he also suggest that the cycle of truth seeking goes: Nothing&gt;PUA&gt;Red pill&gt;Politics ?

&amp;#x200B;

C) Those politically attuned enough probably have figured out that there's only effectively 2 political ideas that TRP is compatible with. And if you thought it was Democrat or Republican, then you would get [AH ZEEEROOO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4bbiN5Lw8o) points.

&amp;#x200B;

But I will tell you what you CANNOT believe in without being cognitively dissonant. **You cannot be a liberal and still be red pilled.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Liberalism**: body positivity, all bodies are beautiful and created equal.

**TRP** : Fat and skinny guys are not ideal bodies, all bodies are not equal. Thou shalt lift. This is rule one. No exceptions/no debates.

&amp;#x200B;

**Liberalism**: Women are goddesses, respect them, worship them!

**TRP**: Female nature is amoral, apathetic. Respect is earned. Women are far from perfect. They are fucked up, but we accept them for that. We don‚Äôt need to put them on a pedestal, and idealise them to accept them.

**Liberalism**: Equality for all! Share your resources, tax the rich to give it to the poor!

**TRP**: the sexual market is disproportionately distributed with 20% men getting 80% of the women. Here‚Äôs how you can become that top 20%.

&amp;#x200B;

Did the chads give you their plates when you weren‚Äôt getting laid? Would you give up your plates to some beta ? Would you tell your plate ‚Äúactually don‚Äôt come over, go to billy betas house, he‚Äôs fat and plays video games all the day and he hasn‚Äôt gotten laid recently""? Did TRP try and get those chads before you or you to give up your plates? Or try to convince women to fuck guys who weren‚Äôt getting their share?

Heck no. None of those happened nor ever will.

&amp;#x200B;

TRP believes in meritocracy: you go out, work on yourself and reap what is rightfully yours. Liberalism believes the complete opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

    The sexual market place is a completely deregulated hyper capitalist free market. There is no such thing as liberalism/communism  here.  

**Liberalism**: We are so oppressed, we are victims, nothing is in our control.

**TRP**: Everything is in your control, you can fix yourself, you are not oppressed, here‚Äôs what you need to know and now go and execute.

&amp;#x200B;

Sex is **basic** psychological need. It‚Äôs on the [bottom of this pyramid.](https://drsaraheaton.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/1200px-maslows_hierarchy_of_needs-svg.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Liberalism and [their economics](https://ifunny.co/picture/fuck-keynesian-economics-oky-vy-all-my-homies-hate-keynesian-cSaz7s9u7) has failed you so much so that here you are..on this random online forum...listening to random internet assholes who you will never meet, to obtain a basic psychological need. Trp isn‚Äôt trying to solve anything complicated like world hunger, or time travel. It's literally trying to solve vast masses of men not being able to meet a basic psychological need.

&amp;#x200B;

How dysfunctional is that? Think how bad must be an ideology be where you struggle to meet a basic physiological need.

# Conclusion:

\- Your ""ideal"" woman will still be a woman. Her nature will be just as of that as any other girl. Idealising her to go against her nature won't work. Understanding her and your nature, what attracts her and what doesn't, the difference between what she says she wants vs what she really wants, however, will work.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Girls are sex objects, stop looking for masculine traits/abilities in women.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sexual strategy is amoral and zero sum. Do not let others tell you how to date or not. Consider for yourself what you want to do, and then do that.

&amp;#x200B;

\- You can not be liberal and red pilled simultaneously.",88,1
You Cannot Control Her,"**Intro**

So you‚Äôve got yourself a LTR that claims she is exclusive to you and isn‚Äôt fucking anybody else. Great! It seems like you finally found your unicorn and nothing can go wrong. After all, you‚Äôve handpicked her from tons and tons of women that you‚Äôve ran through and she is by far the best candidate. Everything is great, right? WRONG.


**Body:**

If you‚Äôre a reader of this sub, you know the signs. You‚Äôve been with enough women to see what excuses they use on their boyfriends. You‚Äôve seen her phone with a message from ‚Äúbaby‚Äù pop-up while you‚Äôre railing her. You‚Äôve heard them confess their lies, and you laugh with them to hide your disdain that lurks in your hindbrain.



Everything is fantastic! Everything is going great! And one day, your precious LTR hits with one of the excuses you‚Äôve heard oh so many times. ‚ÄúI have a doctor‚Äôs appointment after work‚Äù. You think nothing of it, you know she makes frequent doctor‚Äôs visits. And then again a week later, ‚ÄúThey want me to stay later at work‚Äù. You think nothing of it, you know she frequently works overtime. And then again a week later, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be out with a couple of my friends today‚Äù. You think nothing of it, you know she has plenty of friends. However, something in your gut feels off, and you have a flash of all of the TRP posts you‚Äôve read in the back of your head. 



You can‚Äôt seem to shake it off, so you scratch the itch. You call her.. She doesn‚Äôt answer. You text her.. she doesn‚Äôt reply. Two hours later, she sends you a picture of driving home with a text saying, ‚ÄúHeading home now, I love you.‚Äù Now your mind is sinking to all the possibilities. Why didn‚Äôt she answer? Why didn‚Äôt she reply? You know why.. but you deny it. There‚Äôs no way she can be cheating, for you have no solid evidence, despite all the signs.



One day you‚Äôre with her, and she gets a text from some guy you‚Äôve never heard of. Curious, you ask, ‚Äúwho‚Äôs this?‚Äù.. ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just a coworker‚Äù, she responds. You ask to see the text messages. Her phone is in her hand, she shows you the innocent messages and stops scrolling. You ask to see the rest but she deflects, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just all boring work talk why would you want to see that?‚Äù At this point, you finally come to your senses and have an inkling that something is definitely going on; she‚Äôs hiding something.



You ask her if she‚Äôs seeing anybody else. She says ‚Äúof course not, you‚Äôre the only one Daddy‚Äù, then she gives you the best sex of your life. You wrap her around your arms and go to sleep. The next day, the cycle begins anew. You sink yet again into those thoughts, ‚Äúis she lying?‚Äù, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs definitely lying, all the signs are there!‚Äù, ‚Äúbut she‚Äôs so good to me, there‚Äôs no way‚Äù.. STOP.


**YOU CANNOT CONTROL HER**

Your thoughts are wasted. Your breath is wasted. If you ask, you reveal your insecurities. You are in the right to question if she is seeing someone else, but this will be perceived as weakness and ammunition she can use later.


If she wants to get fucked, she will, and you will never know unless she wants you to. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you think, it doesn‚Äôt matter how controlling you are, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you do. If she wants strange dick, she will get it. The only way to stop yourself from having these thoughts is accept that she probably is, and stop giving a fuck and go fuck other women (and you should be already).

**Conclusion:**

You cannot control her. She will do what she wants regardless of what she tells you. You can either get stuck in a loop of denial and insecurity, drop her, or stop giving a fuck.",133,1
‚ÄúMy value isn‚Äôt based on my sexual history.‚Äù,"I‚Äôm sure some of you have seen [this image](https://imgur.com/a/qzdTDH6) as of late. Posted earlier on Reddit‚Äôs front page.

I‚Äôm almost 30. The mere thought of a woman rampaging through society by hopping from cock to cock is undesirably sickening. They spread their legs and have bareback intercourse with dozens and sometimes hundreds of men throughout their 20s and 30s.

And then on her 40th birthday, like two linebackers running full speed at each other into oblivion, she repeatedly and confusingly asks the age old adage, ‚ÄúWhere did all the good men go?‚Äù as she hits The Wall. 

This post is to remind everyone on here that good looking women aren‚Äôt *shit*. No matter how big her tits are, no matter how flawless her skin is, no matter how round or perky her ass is, she‚Äôs **going to get old, and yes, riding the cock carrousel DOES lower your value**. Thinking that you‚Äôre a very expensive violin used by dozens of musicians doesn‚Äôt mean your value appreciates. Women aren‚Äôt delicately treated instruments. Rather, women who continually go from cock to cock become emotionally numb and have difficulties with pair bonding. Hence the phrase ‚ÄúThe thousand cock stare.‚Äù

You‚Äôve seen it, right? You‚Äôre swiping on Tinder. You‚Äôll run into a profile with a girl who is physically very appealing, but her eyes are just dead. And then you swipe again, and there she is in a different body. And after a 100 cards of swiping, you find her, again, with that same stare.

This country has been culturally fucked ever since women‚Äôs rights have obliterated older and traditional styles of the nuclear family. 

Meanwhile, your assets, your liquidity, and income will all increase as you age. Women love the salt and pepper look, and I‚Äôve yet to meet one who doesn‚Äôt.

Good looking women aren‚Äôt shit.

How to Have a 3some [Part 1] ‚Äì Finding the Girls,"Hey guys, I‚Äôve just started writing a fully comprehensive, step by step guide to having threesomes. I‚Äôve released Part 1 that covers why you should listen to anything I have to say - I‚Äôve had 3somes with around 15 different girls at this point - and how you can get started by doing exactly what I‚Äôve done. In Part 1 I start by going into detail about mindset when setting up a 3some - needing to be persistent and why you‚Äôll need to keep trying. I also walk you through what I think are the four easiest ways you can have a 3some:

* Method #1: Bringing Together 2 Girls You‚Äôre Already Seeing
* Method #2: Asking Your Girl if She Knows any Other Girls
* Method #3: You Directly Seek Out 3somes on Tinder/Hinge
* Method #4: Your Girl Finds New Girls

It‚Äôs free to read (not locked behind a paywall) and paired with my [tinder guide](https://killyourinnerloser.com/tinder-guide/)**,** it can be used by literally *anyone*, from guys just getting started to those that have plenty of experience and want to start having 3somes.

Even Part 1 is *pretty fucking long* so I couldn‚Äôt really share it as a standalone post, and a condensed version doesn‚Äôt really do it justice. Plus, there‚Äôs plenty of pics from my various 3somes that you‚Äôd miss out on ;)

Mods, lemme know if this isn't cool, but I'll just share the link to the full post:

Please submit any questions there. For those unfamiliar, we are running a weekly/biweekly call in show where we talk a specific subject but welcome any callers. 

#If you're reading, submit a question! You'll do a lot better than askTRP. 


----------------

For those not familiar with the channel, we're working on producing voice and video content that's a bit more in line with TRP.

""Red Pill"" has been co-opted by a lot of morons who would be laughed out of the sub, especially on YouTube. /u/rpu_mike and I have been covering a lot of the sidebar in a new format through RP University, and doing interviews with various relevant characters and the occasional EC.

This show will be interactive to the extent we have questions that follow rule zero, with DTC and /u/itiswr1tten working directly with call ins.

The general theme of the show is, much like the radio shows before us, the RP way to deal with sexual strategy, having a good time, and otherwise the degenerate shit you get into when you're out playing the field.

Why you should enjoy flaking?,"INTRODUCTION:

Outcome independence (OI) is one of the terms which go under the radar when it comes to the sidebar material. Especially when a unplugging male comes to the realisation of TRP. Abundance mentality, scarcity, this and that. People 'get' that.  Still, there is huge number of questions popping out about females flaking, trying to rationalize reasons why xy female did this or that. Instead, one should dig deep in OI.

&amp;#x200B;

BODY:

I see a lot of guys get razzled dazzled when women flake on them. Especially when it comes to this COVID time, flake rates are higher than ever. 

Men will tend to ask a lot of questions, as most of them will include the question word 'Why?' Why she did this, why she did that, why, why why.

You should not ask yourself any of those questions. Why does not matter. You can not control outer input but you can control your mind. Thoughts and reactions. The thing you should ask yourself is 'Does this thing matter to me? Can I change something about the income?' 

This is appliable to everything in life. But when it comes to this context, context of male to female dynamic, you should literally enjoy flaking. I know it sounds counterintuitiative but...Flaking is part of female nature. They will just switch on and off in a second. You can not change that. It is what it is.

I am not saying that you should tolerate it. Not at all. What I am saying is that you should not stress yourself with why questions. It is just my view point and experience but when someone flakes on me, I just hard next. I don't give a fck did her grandma died or any other shit. But I am actually happy that I got rid of just another trash on my way. 

Here comes OI. You schedule a date. Get flaked. You have your life in place. You planned to take her to the club with good music. Good. Now you can fully enjoy the good music.

You planned to take her to a restoraunt? Good. Now you can fully enjoy the food.

You are aware of female nature. You are not mad. You are thankfull because she disqualified herself and did not waste her time. You won't reach out again. If she wants second try? She better jump those loops.

You continue enjoying your evening.

&amp;#x200B;

CONCLUSION:

As always women should never ever be focus of your life. Women is just addition to a life well lived. Do not try to 'understand' women. Just live your life. Be aware of the flip-floppy female mindset. Embrace it. 

Enjoy being flaked. Literally enjoy being flaked. They dodged a bullet for you. And just do whatever you were planning to do, anyway.",68,1

Just focus on masculinity,"This might come off as a bit of a shit post but this is so important. I started reading this sub like 4 years ago.

Sometimes I‚Äôd forget my path and lose track, especially when covid hit. But one thing I‚Äôve learned is just be a fuckin man‚Äô 


Don‚Äôt sit on this sub all day and listen to these people claiming they‚Äôre gurus telling you how to get laid. Start lifting and being active and going out and socializing. Eventually it‚Äôll come naturally. You‚Äôll fuck up sometimes, and it won‚Äôt come easy at first.

Why going no contact is the only option - a perspective and guide for when things end,"**Summary**

Relationships end, that‚Äôs how it works. It also allows you to set forth on your journey. One of the amazing things about a relationship ending is that you have a clean slate where you can start over and reinvent yourself however you choose. But you have to let things from your past go if you really want to take off on that journey.

&amp;#x200B;

**Target audience**

If at any point after a breakup, you ‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

* ‚Ä¶ wondered to yourself if you really should go the route of no-contact and the answer was not an immediate 'Yes'
* ‚Ä¶ contemplated about her suggestion of staying friends and the answer was not an immediate 'No'
* ‚Ä¶ didn't think of blocking her because she didn't do anything wrong, but you focused on the consequences of blocking instead of her doing something wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Then this is for you. Go on and read this post. If you two broke up, especially when she initiated the breakup, at some point she decided you were no longer worth her effort. You might not realize it yet, but she did you a favor. Now do yourself a favor.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""A couple of weeks ago i posted a story on instagram and my high school crush hit me up and she's now interested and i couldn't help but remember all those feelings i had in high school for her and i fucking missed it. I know i know. What the fuck am i talking about. But some of those feelings kinda resurfaced, but not towards this girl in particular, but just in general.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""But I don't want to block her because she didn't do anything wrong. I can go full no contact, might be hard but I can. Is this route ok or should I just completely block?""

&amp;#x200B;

Both were posted recently on AskTRP. It made me think of my own LTR's and plates. I have had three LTR's and more plates than I can count. Most plates stayed in my life for a couple of weeks to a couple of months max. That's when she would typically initiate ""The Talk"" about commitment. Usually things ended right then and there and I would cut all contact. As for my LTR's, all three of them were woman of high value who really added something to my life. But with all three of them, I got to a point where our paths would separate. And even though this hurt, I went no-contact with all three of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Why my no-contact policy? Simply because I won't allow myself to outsource my happiness to the hands of women. I am currently on the greatest journey of my live to become the best version of myself, and at the end of the tunnel I hope to meet that guy and happily look back at all the things in the past that set me on this journey in the first place. I am going to be thankful for my LTR's and plates, because they all helped me move forward on this journey. But at the end of that tunnel, I am only going to be judged by myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the gist: the only person that will be there with you for your entire journey will be you. And as long as you are not letting things from your past go, you're keeping yourself from really taking off on that journey. So those of you who need this, here is what you're going to do.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The point of going no-contact**

The point of going no-contact is to allow yourself to really take off on your journey, not get a response from your ex. I'll say it again: the point of going no-contact is to allow yourself to really take off on your journey, not get a response from your ex. 

&amp;#x200B;

Read that sentence again. And again. Memorize it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Body**

&amp;#x200B;

* *Grieve*

It is completely normal and natural for men to grieve. But whatever you do, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES GRIEVE IN THE PRESENCE OF WOMEN. Unless it's your mom, in which case you really should start by reading the book 'Mothers, Sons &amp; Lovers' by Michael Gurian.

&amp;#x200B;

Grief is different for everyone. One thing that is certain is that grief comes in waves. The first may be a huge wave that feels like it knocks you down and will never let you back up, but there will be a break in the waves. Grief might last hours or might last for many weeks. It does not make you any less of a men if you grieve.

&amp;#x200B;

If you really want to take off on your journey, it is necessary to fully go through the uncomfortable and bumpy process of grieve. Not completely going through it usually leads to emotions coming out sideways, in non-preferred ways. So find out how grieving works best for you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* *Workout*

Do I need to say more?

&amp;#x200B;

Exercise, because real confidence comes from within. And nothing will boost your confidence more than discipline, getting shit done and releasing stress and trauma from your body by working your muscles.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* *Learn something new*

It's a clich√©, but start learning new things. Things you did not do during your LTR. Start by learning to play the piano, a guitar of whatever your prefer. Do something new that makes you smile, laugh and feel good inside. One of the amazing things about a relationship ending is that you have a clean slate where you can start over and reinvent yourself however you choose. And again: it keeps your mind focused on your own journey, instead of getting distracted by the past.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* *Learn how to love yourself even more*

YOU ARE THE SINGULAR MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN YOUR WORLD. But most people never put much energy into their relationship with themselves. It sounds dramatic, but pause for a moment. Your journey is not complete and never will be.

&amp;#x200B;

Self-love is a process, not a destination. It will never be finished, no matter how red-pilled you think you are.

&amp;#x200B;

The practice of self-love involves working with yourself wherever you‚Äôre at. Having a shitty day? Accept that. It‚Äôs ok. In one of those stretches where everything you touch turns to gold? Beautiful. Use it for good. Your ultimate work in self-love is simply this: allow yourself to really take off on your journey. When times are tough, be gentle on yourself. When times are good, relish them.

&amp;#x200B;

Two great book recommendations:

1. Eckart Tolle - The Power of Now
2. John Welwood - Perfect Love, Imperfect Relationships: Healing The Wound Of The Heart

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* *Do not stay friend on social media, delete her from your contacts*

It is natural to hope your ex contacts you. But it's time to do the healthy thing for a change, so you do yourself a favor and take your false hope out behind the barn and you put it to rest. I would do it for you if I could, but you need to do it for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

You do not want to scroll through you messages and see her name. You do not want to scroll through you contacts and see her name. You do not want to see whoever she's hooking up with on Instagram or Facebook. DO NOT watch her stories, DO NOT like her posts. It will only validate her and set you back.

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing her name pop up in your phone will take your attention away from what you should be focusing on, which is your own journey.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* *Stay the course*

I know, I know. You guys had something special. But it's over now. You might think you'll never find someone as good as your ex, but seriously, SERIOUSLY, that is the biggest lie you will ever tell yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

The feelings from a relationship will linger on after it ends, the point of no-contact is to efficiently filter those feelings out of your life. It's going to take time and effort. Find another life to live and if you stay the course, it will be better than all the previous ones.

&amp;#x200B;

You Are Intimidating Now. Act Accordingly.,"A frame change I wanted to share that has helped me socially:

I used to interpret people being closed off to me as them not liking me. This could take the form of not looking at me, giving short answers, not saying hello to me, and physically avoiding me. Even if I liked them and wanted to talk to them, hoping they would say hello as they walked by, they wouldn‚Äôt.

Now I work a sales job where I have 50-100 outcome-independent interactions a day (I HIGHLY recommend this btw for my young brothers.) The first thing my manger told me when they hired me was to say hello to everyone. And I recently understood why.

I work in a huge store, where it is impossible to find anything first try. So everyone has a question to ask. Some people are warm and friendly, and will approach me. Others will yell to me from disrespectfully long ranges. These tend to be the masculine men and the elderly, who don‚Äôt really give a fuck. But most customers won‚Äôt talk to me unless I talk to them first, and then they have 20,000 questions, indicating that they wanted to talk the whole time. 

Some will avoid eye contact. Others will mumble quiet niceties and hope I move on. Once I noticed these behaviors, I started to see them outside of work as well. Scared body language from people on the street. People incapable of looking me in the eye. Even people who 
freeze when I address them looking them dead in the eyes.

Confident people don‚Äôt do any of that. Even if they don‚Äôt like the way you look, or smell, or whatever, they‚Äôll acknowledge you give you a bit of conversation. As you get your shit together and get your game tightened up, you‚Äôll  have to change the way you interact with people. People will approach you less. They‚Äôll be less receptive to your attempts to break the ice. They‚Äôll feel disconnected from you even if you feel connected to them. It‚Äôll be your job to be open, warm and friendly if you want to make friends with the masses. You have to LEAD now. You are intimidating.

I think being intimidating is a good thing, to be clear. I‚Äôm 19 yrs old, black, 6‚Äô2, and muscular, with good posture and all that shit. I find that other top dogs respect me and the submissive personalities expect my leadership. Lemme not get off topic tho",138,1

Field Report: Her loss,"This is my first field report. It‚Äôs much harder to write one of these than I thought so please I would appreciate constructive criticism. 

I‚Äôve recently been coming into my high value. I had high value before the quarantine and I actually had more muscle mass then, but my mindset now is far superior. 

Anyway, I met this girl two weekends ago. I was on a strip and I approached her, really just for some fun and to see if anything would happen. 

The approach was short lived because her friends pulled up a minute after I approached.

One of her friends came over to joke if she had bothered me in any way. I went along with it and said yeah she was harassing me and then she (the friend that came to joke) started getting in my face and interrogating me. It was pretty funny honestly and I held frame throughout, holding strong eye contact and open posture. Not 30 seconds later this girl wraps her arm around mine and says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre coming with me‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt have anything planned and came out just to approach and have some fun so I went with it. 

This girl is probably and hb5 to me, but it‚Äôs pussy served on a plate so I‚Äôll take it. 

She then invites me to her brothers house for a small get together and I say yeah. The girl that I approached is also going. 

She‚Äôs with 3 friends (including the girl I approached) so on our way there I make conversation and build some comfort with all of them.

When we get to her brothers house her brother is initially confrontational. I hold frame and explain to him what happen and he calms down a bit and offer me a beer. He then says I can have anything in his house (cool). 

I make my way around the house, introduce myself to everyone and have about a 5 minute conversation with each of them. 

One of the guys (the ‚Äòbest friend‚Äô of the girl I approached) asks me what I go. I say I go to ‚Äòx school‚Äô. It‚Äôs a prestigious school and now literally everyone in the party is praising me and asking me questions. Instant status. It was cool. They were saying things like ‚Äúthis guy is the top 1%‚Äù and in my head I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúhmm, I never thought of it that way‚Äù. 

Anyway, now I notice the girl I approached is looking at me wide eyed so I engage her and she starts asking me a bunch of questions. 

We get interrupted so I go back to talking to one of the guys that I met who was pretty chill. 

Her best friend comes over and asks me who I‚Äôm into, since he knows that the other girl was also into me. I tell him it‚Äôs his friend and he goes to talk to her. He comes back and tells me she likes me and is just fronting. From there i just chill out. 

I see the girl I approached, call her M, standing alone, so I say ‚Äúour conversation earlier got interrupted‚Äù. 

We talk a bit and she‚Äôs acting very feminine. Calling me a meanie, playfully kicking me, getting nervous when I hold eye contact. 

I let things play out naturally then she says she‚Äôs ready to go. 

It takes our group about 30 minutes to get ready to leave so when she brings it up I decide to go downstairs with her (isolate).

On the way down she‚Äôs literally skipping and singing and laughing her way down. I have never seen a girl this feminine/happy as a result of a guy. It was crazy. 

Now I‚Äôm downstairs and I start holding her so I can kiss her and she backs away saying I‚Äôm making her nervous. So I stand there and she comes when she‚Äôs ready. 

Kiss her well, then her best friend comes down and tells her to get me home. I‚Äôm 20 and these guys are 25-26 so they are a bit paranoid about my age (understandable).

She orders me an Uber and I go home. 

This past weekend I‚Äôm out on the same strip and I see M and her best friend walking buy. I‚Äôm with a friend so we all decide to get some drinks (M decides to pay for me since I don‚Äôt have money for stuff like that). 

Things go well, I escalate (to which she says I‚Äôm making her nervous). We Uber back to her place and make out again. She tells me I‚Äôm a really good kisser and whenever I pull back she pulls me back inz I say let‚Äôs go upstairs, but she says her father is home and she doesn‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt really care as I had no expectations and she orders me an Uber home. 

This is where I‚Äôm at now. The reason I made this field report is because of the realization I had.

Lesson:

Initially I thought this girl was special because of how much she liked me. Then I realized it doesn‚Äôt take skill or effort to like an attractive guy. I am the one who put in the work and I am the prize. 

There are other girls out there who will like me this much because I have put in the work, and she is not special because of this. I don‚Äôt owe her anything because she finds me highly attractive. 

She has to work to win my time and attention. I didn‚Äôt escalate hard enough those first two times. We‚Äôre meeting at a party this Saturday and I plan to escalate hard. If she rejects me at any point, that‚Äôs her loss, I will just find another girl. 

I guess my point is I almost got caught up in her frame by thinking I owed this girl something because of her attraction to me. I don‚Äôt. She doesn‚Äôt deserve anything and anything she gets is out of my graciousness. I am the prize. 

The thing that made me realize this is that she invited me to her birthday party and said that her friends would be there and are hot. She said I could come if I promise not to hit on her friends. I hesitated and gave a half answer (which I‚Äôm honestly pretty proud of since I hadn‚Äôt really thought about it). But now, I realize, if this girl is so attracted to me, there‚Äôs reason to believe her friends might be. If they‚Äôre hot then I will seduce them. I don‚Äôt owe this chick some fidelity or anything just because she‚Äôs attracted to me. That‚Äôs her problem. Not mine. 

I‚Äôm not sure how insightful this is but I walk around with more confidence that I am the prize after this. 

I easily could‚Äôve fallen into the trap that I owe this girl some sort of commitment because she is so attracted to me. I‚Äôm grateful that this place gave me the foundation to realize that I don‚Äôt owe her shit. I do what I want, and if she doesn‚Äôt like it I‚Äôm gone. 

If I had not worked on myself she wouldn‚Äôt have given me the time of day (understandably so). But now, I have the power. 

I see how she acts towards her friends (that she‚Äôs not attracted to). Especially when I‚Äôm around. She treats them with subtle disrespect. 

That being said I do realize she has invested in me somewhat (she paid for my ubers and my drinks) which I am grateful for and will reward. All on my terms though. 

I‚Äôve been approaching with this mindset and now when I get rejected Im starting to think (consciously), ‚Äúher loss‚Äù.",60,1

Theory Tuesday Megathread: Is Mating a Zero Sum Game?,"I mentioned in one of my recent posts that mating is a zero sum game, to much backlash.  I suspect there's a disconnect between what I mean and how people took it:

Any improvement in strategy for men will harm the strategy for women and vice versa. 

Men and women have competing goals: 

Women want to select, men want to be selected.

Women select for quality, men aim for quantity.

With this in mind, the more he can improve his perceived value, the more likely he is to be selected, while a woman's strategy is to ensure her discrimination is finely tuned to select for the apex of masculinity while filtering out frauds. One party's gain is another party's loss.

Additionally, on a gender level, men compete with men and women compete with women, creating other zero sum competitions as well.

What are your thoughts on mating being ZERO SUM?",62,1
Don't be yourself.,"Don't be yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone's heard the age old truism, be yourself over and over again ad infinitum. Conversely you hear on TRP, to not ""be yourself"" because being you can potentially encompass being a porn addicted, overweight slob with a near 0 N count and low esteem. Probably a nice neck beard growing too with that low testosterone you've cultivated. 

&amp;#x200B;

So where does the truth lie? Should you be yourself as everyone including your parents have told you your whole life? Or be the fake it till you make it pre-alpha that redpill literature screams at you be. (although this did work for me it might not always work for everyone at first)

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I make assumptions based on experience here. Not going to link articles or anything cause im sure some of it is potentially pseudo. 

&amp;#x200B;

From my experience I believe the saying ""Be yourself"" should be first understood as ""Love Yourself."" Don't be yourself but love yourself. Its a subtle difference but think about the repercussions with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Although ""be yourself"" could've started as an extremely important principal of meditatively and mindfully fully being in the moment and acceptance of your humanity etc. It has evolved into an SJW nuclear weapon keeping the lazy on their asses, and the unhappy people unhappy. How you ask? Well because people are fucking inherently lazy and weird in our society and deep down we want an excuse to keep being lazy and weird.

I believe this principal of acceptance of ""being yourself"" is actually meant to appear more as a checkpoint in a period of growth. A rest stop for the weary traveller on the journey to confidence, financial freedom and physical health. A way to reflect on your hard earned whatever the fuck your improving on.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, you've worked out for months and still are slightly over weight and arent as fully happy as you can be. Accept who you are now for who you are at this moment and be yourself at this period in time. Accept this is as far as you've gotten and love the shit out of it. Love your hard work, long days at the gym, love the confidence you've built from lost weight, love your new weight BUT don't stop here. You will still be yourself when you're at your final weight goals. Being yourself isn't a end destination. Being yourself is being present for the whole fucking journey. Every painstaking step. This seems to be exactly opposite to what society and the SJW/feminist etc narrative would have you believe. They seem to attempt to allow anyone to be exactly as they are amd fucking ubereats the definition of perfection across the finish line to them, rather than forcing them to do the work and cross the line themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

NA/AA has something called the serenity prayer that we did before every meeting that I will quote here but I don't want to go too far into this topic. 

""God grant me the serenity to accept the things that I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.""

So bear in mind, I'm not saying to change the things you can't... Obviously. But fuck go figure out what makes you unhappy and change that something. Don't let the society tell you you're perfect the way you are. You're only perfect if you... Love everything about yourself!

&amp;#x200B;

Now loving yourself is different. When people say ""be yourself"" they probably picture some holy acceptance for their quirks, being the person they want to be without fear of what others think. This conjures images of the mega neck beard and deep simpery for many of us on this forum. But what about when you say you should love yourself? People probably see some sort of squishy, unrelatable truth that hippies use to feel less bad about their ritilan addiction in college and a tool get them through a few NA courses. 

&amp;#x200B;

Betas see the confidence and swagger of a fully realized red pilled male and they say,

How can he talk about anime with girls, and still be as confident as he is?

How can he enjoy the same beer as me at this bar but not have a fat gut like mine? 

How can he have both girl friends and a girlfriend and fuck other hoes without them getting mad?

&amp;#x200B;

Well because he loves himself. He knows deep down that he is the shit. His love for himself literally leaks out of every pore. Is this cockiness? Not always, but its okay if it is because who fucking cates? Chad knows when he falls on his ass there probably ain't gunna be nobody there to catch him besides himself (which is why hes in the gym 5 days a week to catch his own 200 lbs of chiseled self)

&amp;#x200B;

Now for a moment, think about something you truly deeply love that isn't a family member or friend. Think hobby or item. You want to be part of it. You want to know more about it, you want to grow with it. You want it to always be there. You are interested in it and want to share it with others, and these examples could go on forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Now imagine being that, taking those feelings towards that love object and building them inside of yourself. Get interested in yourself, who are you? What are your limits. What are your true and honest likes and dislikes? What do you wish you could've done different. Who do you want to be in the near future. Do you know the answer to any of these questions? No? Yes? Maybe? Well figure that shit out and you will be on the first steps to self love. When you love what you do, then fill your life with that, you will see you're the master of your own destiny. Love that you love what you do you will eventually absolutely exude this positive energy from every pore. Do what you love, love yourself for doing what you do. Then bring others into that frame of pure interest, fun, and deep understanding of yourself and the world you surround yourself with.

&amp;#x200B;

Now doesn't that sound eeriely familiar to the idea of what the SJWs want ""being yourself"" to encompass? Where the problem lies is people are lying to themselves that they want to ""be the person they are as they are and not have to ever change anything"". They see these twitter feeds of people accepting themselves for being a overweight and then say if he can do it I can, and use it as an excuse to not to go to the gym.

&amp;#x200B;

Now stop. And be yourself. And no I don't mean like the mainstream, and SJWs would want you to do. I want you to be in yourself, stand in your body. Stand in your life for a minute without thinking about your fucking future, past, or whatever. Be here now. Do you like who your standing in? Do you enjoy being lazy, unmotivated, anxious and socially awkward? No? Do you love any of those things? Well fucking do something about it. Just in the same way you want to work with and help the objects of your love, become the object of your own eye. Turn inward and start changing yourself into something you DO LOVE. Its okay to change. Don't let the media tell you its always okay to be yourself. Its not okay to be an addict and steal from your kids to get high, its not okay to be 950 lbs, its not okay to kill someone else because they are a different skin color. There are many situations where you need to change. And that's okay, be yourself (even if your a complete asshole cause everyone can change). But you'll never be able to be comfortable in yourself, if you don't first learn to find what you do love, and change the things you don't love about you.

&amp;#x200B;

Now there are also many situations where it IS okay to be yourself. Its cool to watch stupid cartoons, embarrassingly thrash around to techno, and write love poems. But if you don't love yourself first and have an aura of confidence about yourself while doing all of those things can looks intensely cringey and can you become hateful towards what you're doing, rather than getting mad at yourself for being the emanator of the cringe. The activities arent cringe, you are. Listen to your heart but please don't be an autistic fuck.  

&amp;#x200B;

Last but not least for today, please remember sometimes what makes you  uncomfortable is exactly what you should be doing. Nobody likes going to the gym at first. No one likes to fail when trying to kiss a girl and she pulls back. There is no one who likes trying to show a cool hobby to a disinterested third party. But we all can appreciate a good healthy body, a good kiss, and someone excited about the music they took years to make. So just because you fail doesn't mean you should stop trying. Just get back in the reigns and keep going. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you truly love something you don't always let go. Sometimes you gotta let it rest, but other times you gotta lay into the mother fucker and hold even harder than before.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck lots of love RP family &lt;3",119,1

They‚Äôre like cats; so they get cats.,"As I‚Äôm waiting for my divorce (aka freedom) my soon-to-be-ex wife‚Äôs cat came up to me, begging for attention. This reinforced the law that the less attention you give, the more attention they give you. The old lady with five CATS and not DOGS is a common stereotype for a reason. There‚Äôs a shred of truth to every stereotype. Cats only come if they need something (to complain, for food, for attention) while dogs come up to you because they love you and want you to know it. Women, love cats. They love to identify with them running away to the streets to gather food and mate. Then, if they require more than they could not access, they come for the rest via you. As a cat ages, it cannot go out onto the streets and collect what it needs. So now, it gives you attention. And medical bills. And it gets fat, and lays around. They still scratch and bite you unless they approach you in need. So, when they are in need, that‚Äôs the time to get all you want. If you chase down a cat, it will surely bite. A dog, however, will run with you; dogs are like men. A dog will gather what you throw and bring it back. A cat will eat it or become disinterested and leave. 
Remember, you are only worth what she crawls to you for. And if she crawls and begs, don‚Äôt give her shit. Remind her she‚Äôs a cat who belongs to the streets. Return her, and she will return back. Chase her, and she will run to the nearest street and stay until she meows and begs for someone else to provide. Let her come, and then you will too. Then, off to 12th and Cherry St. for her.

Women: Creatures of Flesh,"In Gnosticism, there are certain different types of people who are separated based on their abilities to connect to the spiritual world. Whether you are religious or not, this passage should help to illuminate female nature to those of you who see them as beautiful precious flowers.

The four types of people are:

 Sarkic - creatures of flesh  
Hylic - people only capable of material thinking and ""rationality"" based on that, these people have a tough time individuating or going against the grain  
Psychic - people who are awaked in matters of the soul, the place where morality exists  
Pneumatics - people awakened spiritually 

While being redpill aware doesn't make you Pneumatic, we can try and put the true redpills at least in the Psychic category, you are now aware of the nature of women and the world, and reject it. We can place Bluepilled men in the Hylic category. These men are consumerist, are weary of anything controversial, often get the majority of their personality and ethos from either media or which politician of the week is speaking, and are sexually frustrated. Women, and I mean ALL women, are Sarkic, or creatures of the flesh.

What does this mean? Women are, in total, incapable of having a true moral compass. This isn't willful, this is simply the creature they are, women are unable to become 'redpilled' or spiritually aware. They are unable to become immortal in spirit, they are unable to form an ethos that isn't societally enforced (hence the sudden amoral choices they make in private), and are incapable of true sympathy.

I can hear the 'but my girl' replies already so I will break it down further. Men are not usually purely Sarkic creatures, most of the time you will at the very least be Hylic. This is because even the bluepilled man feels as if his life has no meaning, because in the Hylic state you do not have a spirit. Men in the psychic state try and transcend the societal bonds because they restrict freedom, which women cannot comprehend because they are unable to think in terms beyond pure flesh, meaning base emotions. Often the perceived virtue you see a woman have is either a put-on so she isn't ostracized from the community and dropped when she is alone, or something you have projected onto her because of your own biases.

Men are often shocked that a woman will cheat so easily, especially after she decries it in public. Believe it or not, the woman doesn't even see that she has done anything wrong. Women are purely amoral. She speaks out against cheating because we as a society are against cheating on your significant other. When approached by a man she sees as attractive, she may reject him whilst in a relationship not because she values the relationship but because she either sees no extra value in this male compared to her own, or because she is worried that if caught, she will be ostracized. The relationship as a nebulous concept aka 'love' is never considered. This is because the 'love' as men know it is not an emotion women can feel in any sort of ethereal way. There is no love that transcends bonds to women. The reason media that caters to them is so full of it is because they want that higher spirituality innately, as we all do, and yet the love they feel is entirely base emotions, nothing approaching the sort of unconditional love preached by western society as the ideal.

A lot of men want a return to the loving nuclear family of the 40's and 50's, but even then they fail to realize that the white-picket fence ideal did not and will not ever exist. Suburban 50's housewives fucked and sucked just like the women of today, but put forward the societal ideal in public that all women were expected to have. This means that women will adopt in public that which MEN want her to be, in hopes of being well-thought of and desired.

This means that when you become a Chad your relationship problems won't disappear. You are essentially dealing with something entirely different from you, some Gnostics consider women different species entirely. Anything below the level of Psychic cannot love, they can only mimic it. When you fall in love with a woman, she falls in 'love' with the emotions you make her have. When those disappear, she will seek them elsewhere. Too much familiarity with a woman causes her to grow bored easily, and since they act entirely on base emotions, she will usually cheat with a man who makes her feel those things. A woman's loyalty is based on what she feels in that moment and the societal pressure aka, will she be slut-shamed if she sleeps with another man? If the answer is no, and the man she is with makes her feel excited and aroused, she will sleep with him.

Many men will talk of philosophy and be confused when they are bored out of their mind. When men beyond a Hylic level talk of philosophy they are often extremely excited to exchange ideas, as improving their Ego with new ideas and developing their own is a noble pursuit. Women are unable to do this and as such are bored with it. This extends to the schools of thought most women join with by their own choice, their version of Christianity is whatever makes you feel good or is societally acceptable, things that are also apart of the church like the condemnation of homosexuals which is seen as a hot topic are conveniently abandoned by the more liberal among them when pressed by society. This isn't to say women feel empathy for a marginalized group as you would believe if you saw white women and their political rallying today. Women are incapable of actual empathy which is a higher spiritual concept that can only be felt for someone on a lower or equal spiritual tier. Women feel bad for marginalized groups and ideas because they gain social status and approval for doing so, their empathy is calculated and Machiavellian, but also entirely instinctual. The other schools of thought that can extend to higher spirituality like Buddhism are entirely superficial as well. The concept of Karma is easy to understand and adopted as well as aesthetic things like the art and yoga and sometimes the clothes, as well as a very basic form of meditation. Ask a female Buddhist about her view on Noble Eightfold Path or how she practices Right Mindfulness and she will struggle to explain it. Indeed, Buddhists as well agree that for women it is nearly impossible to achieve enlightenment unless they are reborn as a man or move onto the next plane of existence.

What does this mean for you? In short, most of your failure with women is that you think you are dealing with someone who you have much in common with. This is not true. Your perfect virtuous girl is actually unable to comprehend this idea. She operates entirely on emotion. When you are attractive, you make her feel positive emotion, which is why we encourage things like lifting on this sub (exercise also has a key role in some forms of Gnosticism, which I may make a post on at some point). That is it. There isn't a secret pickup line to getting laid because it implies that simple words will make her feel anything. It is emotion, feelings, which get you laid. Women will often get annoyed at a guy who takes his disciplines seriously because she is not able to understand discipline as a spiritual and improvement concept. A man in the gym is becoming one with his ego and improving his state, which she does not consider when she works out. She only works out to become attractive, which to be fair to her, is often what drives young men to the gym as well. Once you see beyond that, which most men tend to do, you become something alien to her. This is why women will claim not to like guys with huge muscles, because her first impression is not the way the muscles when placed in front of her make her feel which is always a form of arousal, but the idea of the gymrat as a sort of modern day monk.

For women, everything is entirely aesthetic. This does not mean entirely superficial, although you could easily interpret it as that. A woman's bedroom often looks cluttered even when it is organized. Although everything is technically 'in a row' there is a disconnect between that and what is ideal in a space. Some women interior designers talk about the ancient Chinese geometry of Feng Shui, which is maximization of energy in a space. They of course neglect the energy aspect as it is beyond them and unable to be felt in anyway other than a discomfort from time to time. This is why most women are fine in cluttered spaces, as unlike most men, even those in a low state, they do not feel the need for much space to move. Most men when caged in such a space will grow weary and tired, as if their energy is being sapped by unknown forces. This is because they are aware that they are in a place with low energy innately. This is also a reason a lot of women are unable to really appreciate nature and natural spaces, because although the energy in such places is much higher than it could ever be in a manmade space, they do not recognize it.

Many men are also confused as to why you should not open up to women with your emotions. This is because although she is a creature of emotion, she is not able to understand yours at all, and will almost always interpret it as weakness. A man in emotional pain looks like a weak male to her because your mental anguish is something she can only feel a simplified version of. This is why psychopaths get along well with women, they often operate on a similar emotional plane. The 'dark triad' that men try and emulate works well because most women act that way regardless. Chivalry is dead because although it is a nice idea which women will publicly applaud, the idea of gallantry and being beholden to a code like that is foreign to them. 

I will finish this post up before it gets too long, and I may expand on this more later, but I will leave you with this. She is not like you. Your concept of women that was pushed on you was a fabrication. They do not understand you, and they cannot understand you on anything beyond emotional instinct. Failure to accept this leads to your problems and your failings with women. When you begin to place your own philosophy and ideals on women, you will find very quickly that she will not measure up. This is not something that only takes place in the west, despite what the asianophiles will have you believe. Japanese women, American women, European women are all the same creature in their base state. Amoral. Does it hurt that you will never really be loved in the way you desire by a woman, yes, but you must accept it or forever live in agony.",83,1

Value Ladder Theory,"Value rules everything to a woman, as in the value she gets from a man and how it benefits her. It is her return on investment for the sex she provides. She seeks commitment from a man and wants the best man possible. This is where the ‚ÄúValue Ladder Theory‚Äù comes in. It‚Äôs a way to determine in her mind, what your worth is to her. I am not advocating being in her frame, but simply providing a way to think about how she values men, from her own mind.  

Below I‚Äôll go over some concepts and then talk about the Value Ladder itself.

First, one must understand a woman has 2 layers. Her base layer, the **Primal Layer**, which every women has. This layer is where hypergamy exists, the need for survival, and desire for resources, leadership, and security exists. The ability to manipulate to ensure survival exists here. Here she uses her senses to determine the worth of a potential mate. This could mean seeing a man with a 6 pack a 1/4 mile away which is VISUALLY stimulating. It could also mean her smelling the pheromones of a man, which is stimulating by SMELL. In this place, she ultimately feels good, bad, or nothing.

The second layer is unique to her. This is her **Personality Layer**. This is where her unique aspects and values lie. This is where chemistry is made with a man and feeds into the primal layer where she then desires commitment but is willing to have sex to get it.  

These layers are important because a man from a distance can look good (have a 6 pack) but then when she is interacting with him and learning about his personality, is he mentally weak or socially unintelligent? Is he ambitious or lazy? These aspects of his personality must mesh with hers so she can determine if he is worthy to fuck. (A side note, being ambitious isn‚Äôt just about monetary success, its about controlling the environment around you and asserting your will. Consider women who like guys with a ‚Äúthug‚Äù like personality despite that man not necessarily being well off financially.)

This is why there is a difference between ONS, dating, and LTRs. A woman may just want a hot guy to fuck (in most cases) but know he isn‚Äôt the right one for the long term. AFBB can also exist here.

Stimulation is also important to recognize here as the concept of **Stimulation/Response** is how we as human beings operate. We see an attractive woman, our body goes through processes that indicate to us that she is attractive (we get horny, get a boner, etc). If we are hungry, our body indicates that by a hormonal process (stimulation) and then we FEEL hungry (response). A woman operates the same way when seeking a mate, even while she has a mate. A man can provide different kinds of stimulation for her and what he provides (or doesn‚Äôt provide) can determine whether she will remain faithful with him or not.

Below is a ‚Äú**Value** **Ladder**,‚Äù the idea being that women always trade up, they will always desire to climb the ladder to get to better resources and forms of commitment. In this place, you are in the second rung, a man who **Demonstrates High Value (DHV)**

**4 tiers**

\-**DHV+** (a man who demonstrates qualities that she is stimulated by and responds to more so than the qualities that you provide and this may or may not be outside of your control. By this I mean, he may be fitter (something that you can respond to, within your control) or he may be taller (something that CAN‚ÄôT respond to, and is outside of your control)

\-**DHV**\-(where whoever she is in a relationship resides and provides positive stimulation for the most part resides, in this case, you)

\-**Indifference**\-she feels nothing and may trade up if something better comes along but isn‚Äôt too active in that search

\-**True Hate and Anger**\-purely negative stimulation-this is when you remove something she values (such as a job, friends, access to drugs, etc. Something she uniquely values but was also facilitated by her, not you, and also created positive stimulation for her)

This negative stimulation is created by you, and whether it was intentional or not, it makes her feel like she has traded down, which is the complete opposite of her feminine imperative. To get to this place, she would have had to trust you and consider you as a man who DHV in the first place and by being in this bottom rung, you in a sense, have betrayed her trust in you. Here she will actively search to trade up and in order to feel good and procure more resources since you are making her feel bad/sad and are not doing what she trusted you would.

**Side Notes-**

All of the tiers can affect both layers in variable ways It just depends on the method which the information is received and which layer that information pertains to whether it‚Äôs her values or her senses.

There are a lot of gray areas and like climbing a ladder, you may not just be on one level, you may be on 2-3 levels, but that will range from DHV, Indifference, and True Hate and Anger.  

You may DHV but over time you could slip into the Indifference tier simply because you aren‚Äôt stimulating her. You may be getting lazy, complacent, not providing push/pull. This is a dangerous place because another man who comes along may be stimulating in a variety of ways and she could ‚Äútrade up,‚Äù simply because you weren‚Äôt doing your part to maintain the relationship.

The lower you get on the ladder, the more likely she will seek to branch swing. The same goes for her interacting with a man who is considered DHV+. As she climbs the ladder, you become indifferent to her while the DHV+ man becomes 

Her personality layer is reinforced by who you are as a man, what your values are, and what your personality is. Whereas the primal layer is reinforced by senses, such as what she sees, how you smell, what she hears, etc. But do remember, your actions, not words demonstrates to her your worth.",36,1

My First 100,"Cold day yesterday when I reached 100 daygame approaches. Busted them out in less than a month. Number 100 was a blowout of course. 99 was a hot Moldovan girl in a biker jacket from all saints. She had a tight ass and her vibe matched mine. I hope she meets up. If not that's okay. Im not expecting one nice swing to be a hole in one. Ive got plenty more rounds in front of me to chop away at my score. Soon I'll be under par... Soon I will be enjoying my first daygame bang.

Learning day game bring back memories of learning to golf. Although I hate the sport, I appreciate what my uncle taught me when I asked to join him at the driving range. I was in my early teens. In the course of a day he was able to adjust my technique to where I could hit the ball straight to about 250yrds. I had to be patient and focus my mind on mechanics and disciplined not to swing at the ball with full might. It was difficult to get my mind where it needed to be. I wanted to hack that ball with full force, watch it sail past the 300 mark. It wouldn't work though and much less on the green. 

When I started golf I thought the problem I had to solve was getting the ball to where I wanted it to be. Just as when I would contemplate daygame I thought I had to seducing women into my bedroom. I was wrong in both these assumptions. The real way to win these games is through discipline and self acceptance. It wasn't until I stopped focusing on the ball and the girls and turned that focus upon my own judgment of my conduct that success began to happen. ""Am I doing this because I want to do it?"" ""Yes"" ""Than good, I am doing good.""

 I love to hit streets these days because I love the feeling I get when I tee up on a girl and effortlessly swing my wood straight. A beautiful sight. I am not bothered by the shots I slice, when I run up to make the stop and she takes a wide angle to avoid me. Im out here accepting myself for who I am and letting the process guide me to who I am going to be. So I show up to practice. And I take my shots unforced. They fly as nature wills as I will my swing. I finally found some love for myself in this acceptance. Ive finally slain the inner self hatred, the thoughts that told me I am a loser, my true beast. 

Now I continue to live it. By going out and approaching. I do it for me.",89,1
Sometimes she just needs some dick,"""Help TRP my LTR has been shit testing me and being so mean and rude and ugh I just don't know what to do--"" 

Stop.

Have you ever tried....  

I don't know.....

Giving her some dick? 

A couple of weeks ago I went to visit my baby mama to see my daughter. We're usually cool and cordial with one another so we were just doin our thang, feeding and playing with our daughter. 

Once she's all tuckered out and asleep in her crib my baby mama starts probing about my life. 

""Are you seeing anyone? Are you fucking anyone?"" Etc, etc.

Usually she never asks and tells me that she legitimately doesn't give a fuck. So I brush her off, ignore her, deflect, and redirect.

But she keeps probing.

""I bet after work you go straight to another bitch's house. All you care about is getting some pussy!"" 

Now she's being beligerent. I roll my eyes in my head, stay quiet, and turn on the TV.

She starts to talk about me not being shit, going all over the place, acting real trifling. 

At this point I get annoyed. Our daughter starts crying, so I tell her to leave while I calm her down. 

She storms out, and after our daughter is calm again she walks back in and talks a whole lot of babble about us ""playing house"" and me chasing bitches. 

Then, it hits me. 

I haven't fucked her in almost a week. 

So I tell her to come to me, and we hug and I pull her clothes off and I knock her boots off.

Afterwards she rolls over to me and asks with a smile ""How did you know that's all I wanted?"" 

---

I've been in situations like those time and time again.   Some dudes here get frustrated, they go nuclear, they log on to reddit and askTRP what magical phrase, word, or tactic will get their bitch in line. 

Have you ever just tried fucking the bitch? Shit good dick will have a bitch forget what she was mad about. Those pair bonding hormones are like crack, and when a bitch acts out she's practically relapsing and going through major withdrawals. 

Give her what she needs, some good dick, even when she seems to completely off her rocker. Just think, when was the last time I have her some good dick? And the key word here is GOOD. Them pair bonding hormones are for ORGASMS. Multiple orgasms. 

Don't be pissy and act out when a bitch does, cause now you got two bitches actin out - you and her. Act like you have some balls, dick your bitch down, and wipe her memory of what happened on some Men &amp; Black shit.",112,1
Why The Average Man Struggles in The Dating World,"Hello my brothers of the Redpill community. Today I would like to share my perspective on the dating world today since being unplugged. Once you are **TRULY** unplugged it is extremely hard to go back to your old ways because you understand the cold truth and must adapt. Here is what I believe is going on in the dating world and why that is.


####The Problem in Today‚Äôs Dating World:

The problem today is that men put women on pedestals and treat them like celebrities, while the man himself has low confidence and feels low value. This causes a man to chase and to feel unworthy of female intimacy. The reason behind this is because we live in a feminist society and the dating world is affected by it. Unfortunately women believe that their Pussy is power and us men have to go through hoops and feel worthy to get a taste of female intimacy. This is why we have females that believe they are entitled to expensive luxuries and other things that men must pay for. This is why women have big egos and make the average man feel unworthy of her love. Beta men gave this power to women because they feed in that toxic ideology by being submissive to anything a women has to say just so he can get pussy.

We have a **DEDICATED** subreddit for picking up women called the **seduction**. I have nothing against the subreddit because there is valuable information that can help you, but most of it is BP because it‚Äôs main focus is **CHASING** women rather than chasing your goals. Again there is valuable information in seduction that can improve your day to day life but if you just take a look at the subreddit you will see what I am talking about.

Fellas, remember that you‚Äôre the prize. No matter how much of a good guy you are, women will end up using you for your resources and will fuck the alpha next door. You must work on yourself before anything. You MUST  become confident and have the abundance mindset. You MUST sexually please a women in order for her to be submissive, not by being nice!",23,1

Khabib Nurmagomedov - The person who showed why a dominant father figure matters in a child's life (The Ultimate Alpha Male),"\-Neglect grammatical mistakes-

As much feminist would want us to believe that man is a useless being for a woman, the truth is that, fathers are the one that make his boy or girl truly shines. Father induces discipline for success while mothers are there to take care for nourishment and nesting needs. Although, most of us are here to get laid but this is not the true essence of redpill; I think this is to achieve glory and excellence is the true focus of the redpill, sex is just the byproduct. Even drug dealers and gangsters get pussy, why attach so much importance to it. I mean if you really think about it, you've this guy on the right and some random Joe who has been having sex every day since 12 years. I am sure all of us will going to vote for Khabib, why because he has achieved his dreams. He has given us good sports while the second guy only pleasured himself. We, men , are made from hardwork, tears and sufferings which we put to get our goals while feminist world is completely unaware of it,for them its just flowers and 'feelings'. They are not aware how value is created in this world which is why even in the age of third wave feminsim where women are more in number in campuses, men are still getting more noble prizes than women. Obviously, those who do have strong fathers in their lives. 

 Indeed, 32.7% of all **Nobel awards** received by **women** were for **peace** (10.4% for males) and 26.9% for literature (11.7% for males). As for men, the highest percents were in physics and physiology, with about 24% of all male-awarded **Nobel prizes** in each discipline, followed by chemistry with close to 21%. 

You see, the STEM field still lacks female noble prize winners.

To briefly put, Khabib has following Alpha traits:

1. A strong nuclear family with traditional roles with both present father and mother to care of his needs. To the contrary just imagine, him being born to a college slut. Do you think he had achieved all of this?
2. He has a strong band of MALE friends for his support. He does not want to cry on the shoulders of a woman. There is nothing with that too but its better to stay away doing this.
3. A clear focus to achieve his goals. A purpose , where women is not the reason because pussy for these men carry no weight when it comes to achieving goals and glory. And yes, it really carries no weight at all, its feminist who think if a man is not fucking a woman, he must be a loser. Sorry my RP bros, I've to disagree with you here. Banging Pussy should not affect our value as men. If an incel is able to create value which benefits the whole world, he is better than that bad boy who is fucking the neighbour's wife. In a free sexual society, just as eating does not affect the value of a guy, similarly, how much is he getting laid should not decide his status as well. 

We should be good fathers to our children even if we are raising them in a single capacity. We should teach our daughters about the dangers of feminism and also how a stable and providing man is still an alpha male and a necessity to a good stable family.

The Red-Flag Date,"Well, it's been a while since I have been on a date, and I got chatting to a lass on FB and we went out for a drive, got some food and just chatted in the car in front of the beach.

It was a fun date but the red flags were pentiful.

The red flags started coming thick and fast as what she started talking about her ex being abusive whilst being with her for 5 years... talking crap about an ex, that's red flag 1, and a history of self harm, (fresh wounds on her body that had surgical stitches) red flag 2, and then came the restaurant.

We get in, they ask me for my name and if we lived together, and when I said no whilst giving my details, she comes out with a completely different name, the crimson gold filigreed flag waving in the breeze and there I am bemused at this point and just trying to laugh off the other two as we sit down whilst processing this decorative red monstrosity flapping in the breeze.

I crack a few jokes to relieve the tension, offer to buy her food, she declines, tells me that she is feeling a little ill so not hungry, and we chat, I order a lovely meal for myself whilst offering starters or nibbles just in case and in the end, I eat my plate full of food in front of a person who is too anxious to eat.

Conversation is good, she is smiling, her face is hurting from all the smiling at the end as the conversation is good, and we park up by the beach and just chat for hours and then she brings up that she has a kid but that she is not allowed to see them, they are staying with the grand parent. As if the other red flags weren't enough but I liked her a lot and went in for the kiss but... she was worried about her breath and... that was that. Took her back home and she messages me telling me her mum has been to see her dealer and regrets not sticking around.

I overlooked a tonne of stuff because I like her quite a bit and went to sleep feeling good but woke up with a cool head and a list of red flags that just don't stop circling in my head, one of which is the fact that I got the impression that she was pregnant, she did outright state that she had periods recently but there was just a really strong gut feeling that paternity fraud is on the horizon.

I don't know man, there's so many red flags and I am sat there in my nice car with good income and no strings on my life looking at a minesweeper board with a tonne of flags planted everywhere thinking, wtf happened to the dating market?",67,1

TRP should be taught at schools to men,"Honestly, if I were taught this during my school years, I wouldn't be in the same position I am today. Most likely I would be care-free and good with women. Instead, I have to use fake it til you make it mentality and pretty much just lie about everything. All men want the same things, lots of sex with lots of hot girls. But most are either too beta to do it or are just simps and believe this ""just be nice and then all the girls will flock to you"" lie everybody repeats - results of our modern-day feminism of course. I should know, after all, I was one of them.

They say TRP is toxic. I admit I have become much more toxic, however, I don't blame TRP for it but rather the fact that I realized what a fool I have been. I have missed stuff that is mandatory for normal human development, however, I will NEVER be able to experience it now. I will never get to have a high school girlfriend and start experimenting with relationships and sex at the right age. Instead, I have to lie and act like I have been with lots of women in order to make myself more attractive because if you are still inexperienced at 26 at today's age, you are a fucking loser. Chances are that I will also never take a girl's virginity. And that has made me hate feminism with passion. Thanks to them I am so behind of everything. Thanks to them I have not been able to satisfy my sexual needs and in turn, it has made me obsessed about it. They and their lies robbed me of the best years of my life and yes, that gives the possibility to make a person toxic.

So, I would say that if you would get taught about TRP at school, it would help prevent toxicity. If you learn about it when you are older, then hate, anger and unfairness clouds your mind and yes, it's much harder to not become toxic. But I've been using hatred and anger as motivation and fuel to my self-improvement and unfairness as an example of how things work in life. 

I obviously have a long road ahead of me in order to catch up, but at least thanks to TRP the road is correct now.",15,1
"Learn to shut the hell up. Never talk about your sexual experiences, even when asked.","**Iron Rule of Tomassi # 2**

*NEVER, under pain of death, honestly or dishonestly reveal the number of women you‚Äôve slept with or explain any detail of your sexual experiences with them to a current lover*.

&amp;#x200B;

When guys who have been sexually / emotionally deprived all their life start committing to self improvement and actually see some results with women, they fuck it up by talking too much. They get laid and blab all about it.

&amp;#x200B;

A potential new plate asks them questions like ""How many girls are you sleeping with?"" or ""When was the last time you had sex?"" and these newly Matrix-escapees do the worst thing you could possibly do when a woman asks you a question: Answer seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

You think telling this woman that you had sex yesterday or that you have a high number count is going to impress her, and actually.... it kind of does. She calls you a player, a fuckboy (which by the way is a fantastic compliment).

&amp;#x200B;

But then she doesn't sleep with you.

&amp;#x200B;

Why?

&amp;#x200B;

By revealing any detail, no matter how small, about your sexual experiences, you have shown to this woman that **you talk**, and that **you will talk about her**. 

&amp;#x200B;

She may seem impressed and call you a fuckboy, but now her anti-slut defence has kicked in massively. Her desire for casual sex now has a potential to be leaked to the public because you have just shown her that you will likely speak about your sexual experiences with her to another person.

&amp;#x200B;

Step By Step Guide on How To Reduce Flaking,"You just had a great conversation with a girl! Maybe you met her through a dating app, maybe you met her in real life.

And she agreed to go on a date with you!

You text back and forth until the day of the date.

And there you are with your cock in your hand, jerking it off to your fantasies about the girl while being careful not to cum - because you're saving that for the date! You cheeky fuck!

10 minutes before the date: ""Hey, sorry I can't make it today because I had &lt;insert bullshit excuse&gt;""

And now you finish jerking off and mark the day as an L...

It'd be great if this was just a one time thing but it happens over and over again and you just can't figure out why! Is it your text game? Is it because you were too needy?

The answer is because you didn't have enough value.

The truth hurts.

95% of the time, when girls cancel, it's because they just don't think you have enough value compared to them. Girls will actively chase high value men while rejecting even the best attempts at getting her to go out from low value men.

And this is especially hard to grasp if you've been working on yourself. You think girls should be hopping on your dick just because you've been going to the gym for a couple months and look slightly less skinnyfat?

So the number one way to reduce flaking is... **to raise your value as a man!** Lift! Make more money! Dress well when you go out!

But you already know that. And if you are looking for a quick fix, unfortunately, it takes more than a couple months to build up your Value as a man and for some people with a low starting line, it could even take years.

So with that being said, in the meantime, here are some ways to supplement your value to get over the top 10% line so you can start getting laid today!

**1) Build a high value Instagram.** Some of you already live pretty cool lives. If you routinely travel and eat out at restaurants, there's no reason you shouldn't be sharing your life on Instagram. If you actually have a lot of cool pics on Instagram, it will make getting the girl to go out with you 10X easier. Now, instead of thinking of witty things to say on text (which she knows is try-hard), she's checking her feed and stalking you! It's literally the perfect tool for making girls chase you. All you have to do is make sure you look good in all the photos and that you have high value friends hanging around you. So delete the old photos of your family members or nerdy friends.

**2) Always Make The Girl Qualify Herself To You:** The ABC's of Sales is Always Be Closing. But with girls, when you keep trying to invent clever ways to ask her out, you end of shooting yourself in the foot because it shows that you're needy and don't have any better options. Why spend so much effort on coming up with witty lines in text if you're actually a high value man?

Therefore, the correct way to deal with women right from the get-go is ABQ. Always Be Qualifying.

When you first meet her, tell her that you're only looking for a certain type of girl and if she's not it, then you won't bother.

After you get her number and you start texting, you're going to force her to qualify herself to you over and over again. If you have a hard time with this, imagine that you are Chris Hemsworth or Brad Pitt and you have millions of hot girls throwing themselves at you on a daily basis. How would you filter out the worthy ones from the average ones?

You'll be asking her questions about her family, what accomplishments she has, what her values are, etc. The more you can get her to qualify herself to you, the better.

**3) Reveal as little about yourself as possible.** When in doubt, Show, don't Tell. Show your life on Social Media, don't tell her jack shit

If she asks what qualities you're looking for, don't reveal it like a dumbass. Mystery breeds intrigue and intrigue forces girls to chase you. Deflect personal question she asks with Agree And Amplify.

When girls ask you questions about yourself, treat it like a shit test. Do not take it seriously and actually reveal what you do - unless you actually do something cool like run a company.

If you're working a boring 9-5 job like most men, there's ZERO benefit for revealing what you do.

You kill any sense of mystery or intrigue and a lot of girls will autoreject you if your career doesn't fit their idea of what a high value man is.

This is hard for most men to understand because they intuitively understand that when a girl is asking them lots of personal questions then things are going really well since the girl wants to know more about them. Then they want to make sure they don't ""screw up"" so they just answer every question like a good beta boy and all the initial attraction they built up rapidly disappears until there's none left.

It may be hard for you at first but you must do everything in your power to keep your cool when things are going well and the girl is asking you questions about yourself. Don't. Reveal. Anything. The rule is thumb is don't reveal anything until after sex. And even then, slowly, as little as possible.

**Conclusion:**

Now, the above 3 techniques are not a long term solution. They are only meant to be a supplement to building up your overall value as a man. So that means you still need to be going to go to the gym at least 3X a week. You're still going to read like your life depends on it. And you're still going to focus on your career or business.

However, if you're actively working on yourself and would like to see some results immediately, then use the 3 above tips and you should see a massive increase in conversion rates for dates.

If you don't see at least twice as many dates as before, write a comment here and I'll work with you to solve your problem because you must be doing something wrong.",59,1

Women and weak men will want you to hate TRP,"This should go without saying, but it's something you will see virtually everywhere else on Reddit and in most social circles online. They will call you an incel, say that no one will ever love or have sex with you. If they know your identify and that you follow it, they will likely try to doxx you. So simply BE redpill without ever talking about it, except to men who come to you for help. It's like men who brag about being a ""dom"" to women. A genuine dom would never even have to say the word, as he simply does.


Why do women and weak men hate TRP as vehemently as they do? For women, it's because they don't like feeling like someone has figured them out, but it's the only way someone will truly turn them on. They will try to take an alpha and feminize him, push him till he caves on a single one of his principles, and then lose all respect for him (and leave). The man they keep around may be a brown-nosing simp so far up her asshole they can taste Tyrone's load from last week, but she won't be able to resist the call of a man who doesn't see her as a ""prize"". A man who passes every shit test she throws without breaking frame. A man who simply is alpha through nature or pure dedication to self improvement. The simps are merely around to push her dopamine receptors when her nature craves validation. What she truly longs for is the other type of man mentioned above. The man who knows her like a precise formula. She will lie to the heavens and tell everyone around her that this isn't the case, that she's somehow ""different"" (or will tell you no women like this), but their actions and receptions show differently. Never be fooled into thinking kissing her ass will keep her around in any meaningful way.


Now that we understand why women hate TRP and don't want you to follow it, why do weak men hate it? The meaning is in my description; they're **weak**. They hate it because they can't break their weak conditioning to embrace it. To them, women are Queens and God's gift to man. You'd think their Intentions would be nobler than the alpha, but they're not. They are also there to get laid, but are terrified to admit to themselves that they have it all wrong. They hate you because they ain't you.


A lion will not be phased by the opinions of sheep. A lion will not break frame to become submissive to the female in his pack. Obviously things in the animal kingdom are different, but you get the analogy. Never let them convince you differently.",169,1
On women's entightlment,"Imagine you are a rockstar/famous politician/ affluent businessman. Your status opens so many doors for you. You go out and people automatically go out of their way to please you. Normal rules that are applicable to average Joe's do not apply to you. Because you are SPECIAL. 

If this suddenly happens, initially you will be suspicious, and start to question yourself and others. You'll wonder why people cater to your needs, you'll wonder what makes you different and all that. 

By time, or if you always had your status. You wont wonder. You'll take things for granted. You will feel entitled to exceptional treatment. You'll probably test how far people are willing to bend for you, how far you can leverage your power. 

Then, you'll have an understanding, that is probably false, that you are THE shit. People going out of their way for you will no longer intrigue you. What will happen is that you will be so used to special treatment that it will be the norm for you. You will be used to getting whatever you want. Furthermore, you probably wont care about giving people what they want or their struggles because that was never a variable. Your status got you what you want. Always. Things rarely were quid pro quo

When this occurs, you will assume everyone must cater to your needs and emotions. If someone doesn't give you what you want, you wont question your own stance, how can you question the baseline, you will question them. You will scold them. You will tell them that they are acting strange and abnormal. You will DEMAND they change to cater to you. After all everyone else does this. 

In the above example, there is a possibility that you have some self awareness and understand that your status offers you the perks you enjoy. 

Now imagine you are a pretty woman. For as long as you remember, people treated you amazingly and gave you whatever you wanted. Not only do you think this is the norm, you probably wont understand that it has to do with your status. You will probably conclude it has to do with YOU. You are SPECIAL thus people love you. 

If that's the case, and you want to fuck/date/ get the attention of a person, and they wont do it. You'll go crazy. You wont understand why. It has never happened before. Everyone wanted to do things for you ESPECIALLY fuck/date/ shower you with attention. Then why does this random guy not want to. Who the fuck does he think he is?! 

I believe this phenomena is one of the main reasons women do alot of things. It's a reason why acting indifferent to women and fucking them gets them crazy. It's a reason why dread game works. It's also a reason why breaking up with women or not wanting to fuck them can elicit some crazy responses from them. It all boils down to: I am special. I was told I am special. I was told so all my life. Who the fuck are you to not agree. 

I stumbled upon this because I wanted to end things with a plate of mine. I didn't want to be harsh so I took it slow and said let's be platonic friends. The idea wouldnt get through her head. She drunk texts me and consistently asks for attention and to get fucked. I want to be nice and thus say I dont have time. She consistently replies with 'well if I'm still available we can meet.' Her entire endeavour is that she has a pussy, and I OBVIOUSLY want to fuck it and by not giving her attention and time I'm losing my chance. 

She fully believes that as soon as I have time I will rush to fuck her. No matter how many times I say I wont. This all is occurring while she knows we wre not exclusive. 

Another instance is actually of me onetitis. I once broke things off with her and treated her as friends and distanced myself. As soon as we got back to talking the very first thing she said was 'well you were treating me as if you friendzoned me'

These women do not understand that maybe just maybe their pussy isnt made of the most precious thing ever. This isnt a hate on women. I love pussy, but sometimes the entitlement baffles me.",17,1

Age Doesn‚Äôt Matter,"I regularly hear this from guys: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in my late 20‚Äôs, it‚Äôs too late for me to get laid with 18-25yo girls now.‚Äù And guys in their 30‚Äôs are even worse: ‚ÄúNo woman under 30 will want me, it‚Äôs too late for me now. Guess I‚Äôll have to date cranky old women now.‚Äù

It‚Äôs a ridiculous, self-defeating piece of propaganda they‚Äôre feeding themselves (usually so they don‚Äôt have to put in the effort and try to get laid.)

Worrying about your age or her age is completely useless. You‚Äôre focusing on something you can‚Äôt change, which is pointless and you‚Äôll only use it as an excuse to not talk to girls and go after that glorious gash. The more you focus on age and obsess about it, the more insecure and neurotic you‚Äôll come across ‚Äì especially if it‚Äôs something you really worry about. A girl will jokingly say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre old lol!‚Äù and instead of taking it as a fun bit of harmless teasing, you‚Äôll get all butthurt about it and make things weird between the two of you.

If you‚Äôre convinced girls won‚Äôt like you because of your age, you‚Äôll create a self-fulfilling prophecy. You‚Äôll get what you subconsciously believe; girls *will* think you‚Äôre too old for them, because you‚Äôre the one making a big deal of it. *You‚Äôre turning a molehill into a mountain.*

I‚Äôm the opposite ‚Äì I know I‚Äôm becoming more attractive as I enter my mid-30‚Äôs. I‚Äôm a more confident man, I look better, I‚Äôm working out at the gym, I know how to get laid with no effort, I have more friends than when I was younger, I dress better, people look up to me as a mentor, I have more hobbies &amp; girls love me. I expect the majority of girls to like the fact that I‚Äôm older, and guess what ‚Äì they do like it. My stubborn refusal to believe anything except ‚Äúgirls love me being older‚Äù means I filter in girls who don‚Äôt care about age and I don‚Äôt even notice the ones who think I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo old‚Äù.

**Girls who think I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo old‚Äù don‚Äôt matter to me because I screen them out immediately and go talk to other girls ‚Äì I literally don‚Äôt even know they exist. They‚Äôre not part of my world.**

I used to be very insecure about my age when I was in my mid to late 20‚Äôs. I felt old and was convinced no girls would like me. I was partly correct ‚Äì girls didn‚Äôt like me, but it was because I was fat, unconfident, boring, had no friends, had no social skills, had very little sexual experience. The fact I was obsessed with &amp; insecure about my age pushed them even further away.

Now that I‚Äôm 33 (as of 2020), age almost never comes up any more. I almost exclusively go for 18-21yo girls (I have my Tinder set to this age range &amp; in person I hit on young university students more than any other demographic). None of them give the slightest shit how I old I am.

It‚Äôs also easy as hell for me to bang older women in their 30‚Äôs, now that I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs ‚Äì 30yo women are much more into 30yo guys than they are 20yo guys.

Truth is, **girls love me at 33 way more than they ever did when I was 20**. Scroll through [my proof stories](https://killyourinnerloser.com/proof/) and you‚Äôll see most of the girls I bang are under 21. And really it has nothing to do with age ‚Äì it‚Äôs the fact I now have my shit together and I‚Äôm someone worth spending time with.

My other mates who get laid are around the same age as me, most of my coaching clients are in their 30‚Äôs or older ‚Äì and they consistently &amp; easily get laid with 18-25yo girls.

Any girls that think I‚Äôm too old for them, no stress ‚Äì we just aren‚Äôt compatible. You can‚Äôt expect every girl to like you and be a good fit for you. I just move on and find the ones who don‚Äôt care about age.

I‚Äôm confident even in my 40s and 50s I‚Äôll still be banging 18-21 year olds. I‚Äôll be much more confident and experienced and better at getting laid, and I‚Äôll be an expert at finding the girls who love older guys. There‚Äôll be a smaller dating pool for me to choose from of course (there aren‚Äôt as many 18yo girls who dig 50yo guys), but I‚Äôll be better at capitalising on the opportunities to bang the ones who are into older dudes.

# The Takeaway

You can‚Äôt let age be something that holds you back. If you‚Äôre insecure about your age, it‚Äôs not the age itself that‚Äôs making you insecure ‚Äì you‚Äôd likely be insecure no matter what age you are. I‚Äôve met guys who feel ‚Äútoo old‚Äù at 40, at 30, at 25, and even a few who are *20 fucking years old* and spout absolute nonsense like, ‚ÄúNow that I‚Äôm 21, I‚Äôm too old to get with 18 year old chicks. I‚Äôve missed out.‚Äù If you feel like you‚Äôre ‚Äútoo old‚Äù at 21, then clearly you‚Äôre insecure to begin with ‚Äì independent of your actual age. That‚Äôs something you can (and should) work on.

You need to stop making excuses and be vulnerable enough to open yourself up to possible rejection. No matter your age, **go out there and talk to the girls you want to talk to**, and just see what happens.

Did I over react?,"

Been in a serious relationship for 4 months. Took my time to see if it was worth investing and I did.
Now lately there are certain behaviors about my gf that have been bothering me, she did them before but I didn‚Äôt care because I wasn‚Äôt taking her seriously at that time. 
As time went on I started having more feelings towards her and that‚Äôs why it started to affect me a little more.
What bothers me a lot is when we‚Äôre gonna do something and she just disappears out of nowhere.
We‚Äôre pretty busy so I don‚Äôt mind us getting our stuff done before but what bothers me is when she suddenly disappears without saying anything until last minute. Last week she did this and I told her how i wasn‚Äôt gonna put up with that because it feels like she doesn‚Äôt care and it‚Äôs wasting my time.
We had a fight but we fixed it.
Now today she hit me up at like 1 am and I replied because I kinda woke up to take a piss. Didn‚Äôt say much and fell asleep. She ignored my reply and at 3 am I was kinda feeling like hitting her up and talking to her.
She was being pretty mean about the situation so I went to bed and told her to talk to me when she actually wants to. She was being nice but I was still bothered by her behavior. Just told her I thought she was being disrespectful and she just said to let it go and forget about it.

It still bothers me because she didn‚Äôt actually apologize, she just said she was having a rough day and that‚Äôs why she was being like that.

Now I don‚Äôt really know what to do, I feel like I just wanna take a break from her because lately this type of stuff has been bothering me more and I feel like she doesn‚Äôt respect me as before. Should I just fall back and distance myself or should i just tell her what‚Äôs up? Thank you guys.",7,1

"Never, Ever try to convince a woman (about contentious issues)","This is often overlooked by us; we always try to give justification about our actions. Although giving reasons to your bros is a good step to gauge where you are ending up but in no way you should ever try to convince your woman about something she has already made her mind even if you believe that's outright dumb. This is for following reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. She thinks from her emotions while ours way of thinking is logical. You cannot make logic so perfect that it could change her emotions.
2. She should have enough trust on you that whatever you say becomes law of the universe to her. If she doesn't do it, she hasn't truly submitted to you. If she hasn't, there is no point in convincing her that she should. Read point 1 again.
3. Her reptilian mind wants to make her feel happy irrespective of future consequences. She wants to secure her 'feelzzz good' supply of stimuli for now, as for future, its too uncertain. If you try to convince her that what she is going for is bad, you are making her feel bad about herself and stopping her from getting that 'feeelzzzz good' stumuli which is present at the moment or near future. Hence, she would pick something which is making her 'feel good' instead of 'feel bad' stimuli which is you trying to convince her.
4. Women are not open to anything which they don't like which is why the female dominated subs get you banned for simply disagreeing with a woman. They would also like to ban words because those words are making them feel about themselves and robbing them of feel good stumuli.

Thus, you should not convince any of your female friends, why:

1. Red pill truths are applicable in western societies.
2. MGTOW is not anti woman but anti marriage.
3. Hook up destroy pair bonding ability.
4. Looks matter more to women than men.
5. Feminism is about matiarchy.
6. Women are emotional and are less responsible when it comes to power.
7. FDS sucks.
8. Making silly youtube vidoes convincing general public about the truth of feminist women. 
9. (Anything you can think of which Redpill guys are trying to convince women)

Hence, you should:

1. Convey your point (if she is decent enough to listen).
2. Make her suffer the consequences without needing to 'rescue' her. Remember it was her choice and you can't convince her (Read point top-most point).

&amp;#x200B;

We shouldn't try to make RP mainstream, no one should talk about fight club. No one should tell that they visit this sub. Simps are everywhere and women shall not be convinced. It is also written in the 48th laws of power:

""DO WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING, THINK AS YOU LIKE""

If society wants to give prize to women for simply having a vagina, let them be. Enjoy the fact that how blind they are. Redpill has not made me anti woman, it has opened by eyes; it has taught me that I shouldn't love a woman unconditionally and I need not to waste my time convincing her.

Good luck mates.",104,1

Here‚Äôs a thought,[removed],1,1
What's usually the first move you make when escalating?,"I'm sure this is gonna earn me some down votes and I realize there is a sub dedicated to these questions but I vibe so much more with this subs way of thinking and I honestly think I could get way better advice on here than some pua forum.

I don't have much trouble approaching women or building attraction but I really struggle when it's time to escalate things.  When I try to do this it always feels like I'm being way too obvious and kinda like I'm forcing it...it simply lacks a certain ""smoothness"".  I think that when done the right way it should be smooth enough that it doesn't even seem like you're making a move at all. It should feel like it's *supposed* to happen and you are both just going with the flow without really thinking about it.

So, I'm just wondering if you can give me some examples. When you are with a girl, what is usually YOUR first non platonic move? Do you like to escalate verbally first and then get physical or do you just start touching her in a casual, subtle way and ramp it up slowly?

The sheep in wolves clothing,"I was sat around my group of friends - naturals and pretty girls...

I started laughing. They asked me what was up. I told them I just thought of a funny memory.

They didn't know what I really thought was ""They think I'm one of them""

&amp;#x200B;

These are people who never had issues with the opposite sex, who were always invited to parties, who didn't have to read hundreds of articles on game, female nature and social skills.

And here's me. The sheep in wolves clothing. The most dangerous of all.

&amp;#x200B;

Even the naturals would ask me for advice. They would say shit like:

""I wish I could pull girls so naturally like you"" My brother you do not know how many hours I've spent watching Alpha Male Strategies.

""Bro you have mad confidence, how do you approach girls so easily?"" By being rejected hundreds of times, faint heart never fucked fair lady my friend. u/VasiliyZaitzev

""How do you make these girls do want you want man? Don't they think you're being sexist and controlling?"" Fam just read everything u/HumanSockPuppet has ever wrote. Then read all of his posts every year of your life.

""We heard you fucking that girl from Tinder, how tf did you last so long and fuck her so hard? My wardrobe was shaking 3 rooms down from yours!"" Check out the Sex God Method and you can too.

&amp;#x200B;

After years of implementing the red pill into my life, I am a master at deceiving others.

The pretty girls think I'm the non-judgemental casual sex guy, so they open up and tell me all of their sluttiest moments. The lays that they don't add to their number count. The quick fuck that their boyfriend never found out about.

My plates tell me all sorts. Did you know these women are all fucking their friends? It's true, we just didn't believe it because we were those needy friend-zone friends. But these friends that the girls fuck, are also the casual sex guys, the guys they go to parties with. The cutest, 'innocent' girls, slutting it up and all the oblivious, judgemental guys will never find out.

&amp;#x200B;

There's so much casual sex here. It's so normal. And because of the thousands of hours of intention I've put into improving myself, I'm the best of them all.

The sheep in wolves clothing is the most dangerous.

[FR] Model Double Feature,"**Intro**

Did a double feature with the model (have tapped at this point) and a new insta girl (1st date, ~500k followers type). Model is essentially in the bag, and she is at the top level of the game. Signed to a national retailer you all know the name of. That's a 300k/yr retainer for her and she posted up $1.5mm in her best year ('18). Top of the food chain. 

She is vegan now because she kicked her coke habit and can afford to hold onto the 15-20 extra lbs because of the Rona, which she is thankful for. That one is pretty much settled.

**1st Date**

However, this new girl, 1st date right after the real model, is a very interesting character. We vibed quite well - she told me upfront that not only do I clearly have the type of direction in life (career, ambitions, desires) that turn her on, but that the way I talk to her is different and made her ""very curious"". I picked her up from her girlfriend's place to go to a raw bar for light food and some drinks. TBH, i rarely do food on a 1st but all rules are meant to be broken and even at her level of the model game I KNOW from her photographs and social media presence she travels for free.

So I have 2 questions to answer on this 1st date.

1.  What is her real level of access? This is answered by getting her to qualify herself to me.

2. What is her side hustle? Even with a half mil insta followers, you peddle some digital market, shill some product, but THEY ALL NEED A SIDE HUSTLE. 

The game is too fragmented and the internet means money can find hot bitches faster than ever.

**The Date**


As we ride over, we're blasting music, I am throwing some song recommendations that are unique to her caribbean heritage - AKA, I am proving I am culturally educated to her original way of life. 

I tease her about how her parents definitely think she is a good girl and try to run her life. She laughs and agrees. We both share stories of the last fucked up relationship we were in, nothing gets the FEELZ going like that.


Once that is done, and she has vetted me to be the type of mover/shaker I am in my career (let's be real, models know finance guys pretty well) she is ready to spill guts. So I corner her. ""So....[name], what is your side hustle?""


She wants to tell me about Maxim and Playboy and working photographers to tag along on bigger shoots, but I shoosh her. 

&gt;""What's your REAL side hustle?"" 

She gives a big, mischievous grin.


&gt;""Well....I am a bit of a madame.""


For those who don't know, that's a female pimp.


She is exceptionally good at finding and directing hot pussy into the laps of rich men.


Very interesting.


For those who don't know, hot pussy is a very critical piece of currency among the upper class. When I say upper class, I mean 0.1%. Middle eastern oil guys, Bilzerans (know he is a fraud but he didn't spend like it, point is that social media type), russian oligarchs, billionaires, etc. If you've met rich people (not to be confused with wealthy) they are almost exclusively single men and dudes with OLTR-style setups. 


She wields that currency, and her street/social smarts build respect amongst that crowd because she is the not dummy amongst a sea of hot dummies, and they do what she says.


""Hmmm....I am not surprised"", I respond. ""We have something in common. Hot girls will do what we want."" She laughed and said I am the first app date she's ever gone on - she otherwise just uses it for attention. Surprise surprise. I don't care if it's the truth, even as a lie it's an attempt to qualify herself to me. 


At that point we've seen eye to eye and I can tell we're going to have fun together. Whether it stops at FWB or not, this is a good friend to hang onto even if we stop fucking. The GAME recognizes THE GAME. She laughed to herself and said the same.

**What's next?**


We will see where it goes. My main angles are to maximally exploit new insta and signed model's social circles for social proof and new contacts in the Hot Bitches game. Also, insta girl is very bisexual so OLTR and I will definitely fuck her together. I suppose I am a magnet for these gay bitches now. Cool.

**Takeaways**


Morals of the story: just be cool. The less you're fazed by their connections and clout, the more they want to share it with you. Two - model tier bitches know lots of model tier bitches, and they all share. Three - there are dumb hot bitches and smart exploitative hot bitches. You can *fuck with* the latter but only *fuck* the former, for your own good.


Last but not least, Rona has locked down travel, which has severely limited the ability for these true 8.5-10s to move around. They are on dating apps. If you have the frame and game, the time is ripe to fish for this type of girl. They are bored, horny, and open to meeting the right type of guy.

My Asian Parents,"I love my parents. I'm 40 years old and they're in their late 60s &amp; early 70s. 

Well, love might be an over-used, vague word. 

I like my parents. I enjoy hanging out with them overall. We make each other laugh, usually. 

However, with them being 1st generation Korean-Americans plus devout Christians, they have *very, very* conservative family-centric values. It's an obsession, a slave-like mentality.  

But I've been there the ringer before. A handful of years ago I was married and I failed. Luckily I didn't have any kids and there was hardly any financial fallout. (Note: If you're going to get a divorce, be broke.) 

*Yet my parents won't give up.*

So last weekend the three of us are having lunch at my apartment. Table full of Korean food. My Mom, with a cheeky smile, tells me to check my phone. She's sent me photos of a Korean woman, slim, nice-looking but clearly post-wall. Mom goes on an unsolicited rant on who this woman is, why she's single at 40, what she does for a living, how I should meet her, blah blah blah. 

(Note: Korean-style set-up dates are purely for marriage only. Any sort of dating without marriage in mind is looked down up and I've been 0-for-whatever in these rice-pressure-cooker boring-ass dates over dinner which I have to pay.) 

I put my chopsticks down and look dead in the eyes of the one who brought me to this world. 

&gt;I married and failed. That failure almost killed me.   
&gt;  
&gt;I will never marry again and I am at peace. My cup overflows, as the Bible says.   
&gt;  
&gt;Several times since the divorce I've told you.   
&gt;  
&gt;I will never marry again and I am at peace.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'd be happy if you found peace as well.   
&gt;  
&gt;But that's up to you. I'm here for you until it's your time to go. 

I went into detail how eating lunch with them and hanging out with them is surreal at times. Why? Because I thought for sure I'd kill myself when my marriage failed. I had failed my parents in the worst way possible and I couldn't stand myself. That's why it's weird just chilling with them sometimes, even now.  

Marriage is cancer to me; I survived it once, I'm not going to do it again. Why do my parents keep suggesting marriage to me like it's a fun Netflix series? 

It's clear. They're not listening to me because they can't. They're plugged in and they don't want to see the truth. They enjoy being slaves. No matter how strongly I share with them, it doesn't matter. 

Let them be. 

I'm at peace.",234,1

The Iron Rules of Poop : Don't be a Poopy Pants," 

# The Iron Rules of Poop

* You cannot allow a woman you‚Äôre in a relationship with to have male friends. Period.
* The goal with a woman is to fuck her. Every move you make should be progressing towards that goal.
* There‚Äôs no such thing as a woman who‚Äôs truly single. She‚Äôs at the very least talking to a few different guys at any given time, so you have to look GOOD and stand out.
* There are multiple external factors at play which you have no control over. Remember, she has a life, too. Her grandpa died. She‚Äôs sick. She‚Äôs in love already. She failed a test etc. If that‚Äôs the case, just move on.
* She gives you a hard time? She‚Äôs uncompliant? Drop your attention to zero and speak to another woman.
* The perfect woman does not exist. She must obey you. Some women are more moldable than others.
* Every single hot girl has a personality disorder. They have attention dumped on them as soon as they grow a pair of tits, and they continue to be showered in attention until their late 20s to early 30s.
* Here‚Äôs a major mindset shift for most guys: what would you rather do‚Ä¶ lavish attention on her, invest a ton of time money and energy, do all this work‚Ä¶ and possibly still not get anywhere with her‚Ä¶ or give less attention, that she values over almost everything else?

**The Ultimate Toilet Poop-Test:** 

Your attention needs to go to nearly 0 once you sleep with her.

You set standards. Think about it...  


Once you fuck her, you are in the position of power.  


If you fuck and she never talks to you again, she‚Äôs a slut.

She should want¬†to keep YOU.

**Off The Roll dunk facts** **:**

* women are designed to share a man
* YOU NEVER EVER APOLOGIZE for sleeping with another woman. Once you admit fault, they will tear you apart. But don‚Äôt lie either. Reassure her that you love her and only her, that you‚Äôre just having sex with these girls and that you don‚Äôt care for them in the same way.
* You don‚Äôt ask girls to go on dates. You TELL them. No ‚Äòsometimes‚Äô. No ‚Äòwould you like to‚Äô.

**""Hey Rational Toilet! This is WAY too hardcore brotendo!""**

If a guy is in a state of abundance with women (either mentally or having multiple plates) he can afford to set his own standards and afford to lose any pussy if it leaves him.

I personally believe in such a radical approach.

For it is polarizing. In both *action* and *feeling.*

This will affect the women you CHOSE to let in because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**A guy can chose to be selective when he has the abilities to do so.**

He can take the opportunity cost and instead of reading *""Alpfa scriptz""* set his **OWN** standards.

I can't set standards for other men.  

A lot of guys hate women because they let poopy women for them into their lives.

Guys gotta learn what they want, then find the appropriate blueprint.

Women are women.

But a bad blueprint is a bad blueprint.

Dependency 101,"&amp;#x200B;

At this moment, in many cities, everything is closed: schools, sports facilities, outdoor recreation areas, bars, restaurants, everything that is a social minimum. The only things that remain open are shopping malls, grocery stores, cannabis stores, liquor stores and pharmacies. In short, the only things left for a 15-25 year old who is not able to control his or her impulses is to develop an *addiction.*

It's very easy to become addicted to something today. Society almost makes it so that you fall into this tortuous cycle so that you can't get out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What is addiction?**

&amp;#x200B;

Addiction is a behaviour that is based on a repeated and irrepressible desire to do or consume something in spite of the motivation and efforts of the subject to get out of it. It can relate to behaviours such as compulsive gambling, video game or internet addiction, pornography, addiction to products such as alcohol, tobacco or various psychotropic drugs. The problem with this addiction syndrome is that the subject engages in risky behaviors, despite the acute awareness that he or she has a problem of abuse and loss of freedom of action, or the possibility of their occurrence.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why does addiction exist?**

Addiction exists simply because of the neural reinforcement circuit. Dopamine is the key neurotransmitter in the neural reward circuit. After a period of time, it signals the anticipation of pleasure. Finally, dopamine triggers a molecular cascade that leads to short-, medium- and long-term cellular adaptations. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How does addiction evolve?**

&amp;#x200B;

For example, let's use Jean, a model man in society.

 John lives a normal life. During the day, he works 50% of his time at the office, he uses 35% of his time to look after his family, 15% goes to his friends, 8% to his hobbies and sports, 2% for a small drink in the evening. Here we notice that Jean uses a voluntary behaviour towards his vice, i.e. the end result is important to know the nature of the pleasure. Pleasure is important to him for repetition.

*Gradual increase in consumption.*

After discovering the new Cerveza Corona with its peach and raspberry flavour, Jean cannot help but buy a case of 24 a week, so his consumption now takes up 25% of his time, which considerably reduces the time he spends on other activities. From this stage on, there will be a routine, he will associate his behaviour with pleasure. The end result is less important, because he knows the nature of pleasure. Pleasure becomes less crucial for repetition, it is the anticipation of pleasure that becomes more important. Jean may have conditioned reactions. Indeed, elements in the environment will now be able to trigger the desire to consume, for example, seeing a bottle of beer on TV, or simply entering the word drink.

&amp;#x200B;

*Progression towards addiction*

Alcohol is gradually becoming an irresistible craving that now uses 50% of its time.

&amp;#x200B;

*Dependency*

&amp;#x200B;

Alcohol is interpreted as a vital need and takes up 85% of Jean time. The behaviour has now become a habit. It has a very strong emotional charge, anticipation and uncertainty have become very important. Then it becomes an obsession triggered by various stimuli.

&amp;#x200B;

Here I used alcohol, but it could be anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand, I'm in a bad position and I want to stop, what should I do.

&amp;#x200B;

Some studies show that addicts who try to reduce their consumption do not succeed in doing so over long periods of time. Other studies show that among addicts who have become abstinent, only a small proportion will be able to return to moderate use. A total cessation of the vice, at any rate momentarily, is therefore strongly advised to optimize the chances of getting out of it.

There are many ways to stop using, the best is to modify your environment accordingly. For example, if you are addicted to coke, you just have to stop buying what is left of it. If it's for video games, completely remove all games from your computer that you could play. If that's not enough, change your computer to one that won't be able to run the games, otherwise don't have any. The first step is always a step of will, if we don't have the will to change something that doesn't work, we can only blame ourselves. We have to make the sacrifice of. Sometimes, the vice is too ingrained in us, it can ask to go to a professional or even to go to rehab.

&amp;#x200B;

**What happens when I stop** 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When you abstain from drug use after being conditioned to it for a while, a process called withdrawal or abstinence syndrome occurs. This occurs as a result of the withdrawal of the substance or activity and the readjustment of the nervous system to the absence of the substance.

The nature, severity, onset and duration of withdrawal vary according to the type of substance use, the doses used, the frequency and duration of use, and the biological and socio-cultural factors of the individual.

Symptoms tend to be the opposite of the effects normally produced by consumption. Withdrawal from long-acting drinks starts more slowly and is usually less intense, but is of longer duration. Conversely, withdrawal from short-acting drinks starts more quickly, is more intense, but is of shorter duration. *Withdrawal symptoms can be so intense that they may cause the user to take the psychotropic drug again.*

&amp;#x200B;

For example, taking a heroin addict gives a state of paroxysmal well-being, peace and fullness almost as intense as orgasm and lasts about 6 hours in the body. A slow withdrawal is obtained from 36 hours onwards, which can continue for 5 to 15 days depending on the level of intoxication.

Is getting a quality girlfriend nowadays nearly impossible?,"Hello all. I joined the red pill community some months ago and while it didn't really change who I am, I could learn a lot about how to approach situations differently and get a mindset thats a bit more positive. One thing that was eye opening to me was how many privileges young women do enjoy. 

That said, I keep wondering what it takes to get into a quality relationship nowadays. I am currently 25, halfway through second year of college (I worked before that and saved a lot of money, I wanted stable finances and work experience first over getting into college right after school). I got multiple people around me, as my friends too, who are 1 year younger or even ones that are 3 years older than me.

But for me and for them getting into a quality relationship is extraordinarily difficult. A bit of info about me, before you say its probably me being unattractive: I am 6'2'', go to the gym at least 3 times a week, minium, often 4-5. I have stable finances, work on the side and am doing a major in computer science and minor in business. I would say I am above average looking at least and I have no problems talking to women. However, most things I talk with them feel shallow and they aren't interested in anything meaningful. Most of them only got interested in me once we started talking and some of them got ""hints"" to how much money I had saved, I don't know how but suddenly they were more ""inclined"" towards me after some talk of what I did before (it was a relatively well paying job that I didn't want to keep doing). I see lots of women around the ages of 21 being REALLY REALLY condescending and picky towards guys that age and even talking about other women their age about rating their looks (usually just ugly, they never say a guy is good looking), its like kindergarden. 

I got an offer or two for a hookup but I am not looking for that, especially if I have to pay for an expensive date beforehand, just to get a chance.... Without just wanting confirmation bias, it feels like most women in their 20s are still very emotionally immature and very very picky, wanting the ideal man, where 6'2'' and good finances and healthy body barely qualifies for a quick hookup. 

**So first question is:** Is this normal nowadays? It makes me a bit cynical but it just feels...unjust. They did nothing to ""deserve"" some of these men. Men who are not physically attractive but they have some of the nicest and interesting personalities out there. I knew one, who was super nice and forthcoming but he was 5'7'' and got literally laughed at when he asked a girl out. 

**Second question is:** How do you go about finding a quality girlfriend/relationship? Approaching women real life rarely works out and so does online. I try having talks with some women my age or 1 year younger and frankly, they are only a tad more mature than the 21 year olds, they are still only interested in ""adventuring"", not in a stable relationship. Will that ever change? Where can you look for high quality girlfriends anymore?",2,1

It Just Happened,"###Intro: 

‚ÄúIt just happened‚Äù is understood to be the female hamster‚Äôs explanation for hooking up with a guy. I believe it also helps to describe a successful mindset when it comes to women. 

###Body:
In order to make it ‚Äújust happen‚Äù you need to approach women with an Idgaf attitude. If you see a girl you think is cute, you approach just to see what happens (could be nothing).

To help get into this mindset, you should get in the habit of talking to everyone. Now you obviously don‚Äôt need to talk to literally everyone (although I am considering doing this when I get back to school), but you should be talking to people all of the time. This teaches you how to not need anything from talking to someone, and how to enjoy a conversation. 

Generally approach people who you think can add value to your life. This can be an attractive girl or a group of cool looking guys. As I said, approach just to see what happens. Go with the flow, but keep things positive (This your frame: stay positive and enjoy yourself at all costs. If you‚Äôre not enjoying it, leave it.). 

In this sense, by interacting with people and just seeing what happens, when something good does happen, **‚Äúit just happened‚Äù**. 

Of course you need good game and high smv if you want any options. Good thing you‚Äôre lifting and talking to everyone. You should still be seductive, but that shouldn‚Äôt be forced, it should be natural and should stem from your confidence, which presumably you have some because you‚Äôve been working on yourself and seeing results. 

This advice is more for people who have balls and are putting in the work, but still can‚Äôt seem to figure things out either women. I‚Äôve recently been starting to put things together and have been seeing a lot of success. 

###TLDR:

Talk to everyone. This will develop a sense of outcome independence. Talk to them to see what happens. 

Whatever happens happens. Don‚Äôt try to control people or outcomes. Just let things happen, and you will find that often times, if you‚Äôre high value, good things will happen. 

You can‚Äôt expect things because then you will be disappointed. 


I‚Äôm considering writing a field report. I‚Äôll only do it if there‚Äôs actual interest.",49,1

Action: The language of success,"When going out and up the mountain of improving one's situation some will be put at the bottom.

In order to climb efficiently, they will need to diminish any bad habits and thought patterns.    

Many use reading books to fulfill this. However, reading can only help so much.

&amp;#x200B;

The brain and it's nervous system best respond to external stimulus. By putting yourself through trials you can gain more awareness and you are better to respond to the issue. 

You can read about lifting weights all day and know what should be the perfect form however not be able to deadlift 400lbs.

You can learn without failing.

However you cannot succeed in the world filled with mistakes if you are determined to never fail.

Early days of Tinder and the loser,"I used to have a friend who I'll call Mike. I met Mike 12 years ago at high school. Mike thought he was hot to trot, slicker than grease and alpha as fuck. In reality he was just attractive, played sports and had decent middle class parents. Not that he needed it after fucking half of the high school girls (likely a tall tale as Mike loved to aggrandise himself) but when Tinder dropped was like a blessing from God, like a license to fuck. 

Aside from his main phone he had a burner phone with multiple profiles/identities. I was doubtful of the stories he bragged to me but I soon saw the proof in the pictures he sent me. While I was beginning my downfall into depression, junk food, gaming and porn addiction Mike was doin okay. In fact he was drowning in pussy. Going around town like Pizza Dick, sending me his 'trophies' for me to 'enjoy'. 

 I'm not even beta (Idk what 'male archetype' I am, omega maybe?) but it I knew it was at best unethical and at worst fucked up uploading pictures he sent to the internet. At the time thought it was a massive fuck you to the girls I couldn't get but it was just a reflection of the shape of my downfall to come. 


As a fat gamer at the time I thought he was the ultimate apex pussy hunter alive and was rather jealous. Mike was an adept manipulator was a many years before I realised what shit friend he was. Mike used my time, money, and even slept at my place as bat cave as I had no other real friends, also as a means lay low. He'd also regale me of his tales which was essentially him stroking his ego. 

The penny took a long time to drop for me but it eventually did. There was no final straw just a gradual acceptance of the facts. But his bill came due. While still slaying he got into drugs getting progressively harder in strength causing health issues at 30. 

Mike ended up broke, fat, selling all his possessions to pay rent to keep fucking his below average plate at the time cos he could no longer get pussy so easy. He is now back at home in his 30s after his thriving drug business dried up due to the pandemic with no plan b after living life in the fast lane, even while raking in big money since his late teens. 

Mike has tried calling me 4x in the past month after not ringing me for 6 month periods at a time when I was going on my journey through hell 4 years ago (wild turkey and box wine daily diet). I can only imagine what Mike wants. 

TL;DR - Asshole ex best friend who would gloat to me how many women he fucked with vivid proof while I was an angry fat nice guy‚Ñ¢ won't stop ringing me now that times are tough (and I assume wants some help).

Value of Female Friendships in LTRs,"I used to see zero to minimal value in having platonic female friends. If we‚Äôre not hooking up, I‚Äôd rather hang out with my boys anyway, so what was the point?

Well, I‚Äôll tell you what the point is...dread.

When you‚Äôre in an LTR, having female friends will level the playing field a bit. You‚Äôll be able to pull the same bs shit your girl occasionally does with orbiters / platonic male friends.

‚ÄúOh he‚Äôs just a friend...‚Äù

Well yeah, maybe he is, but what your girl also instinctively realizes is that a friend of the opposite sex isn‚Äôt just a friend, it‚Äôs a friend who you could maybe fuck. This instills pretty significant dread. They‚Äôre aware of this, hence part of the reason they love telling you about their orbiters.

Plus your girl won‚Äôt be able to get mad at you if some random chicks names keep popping up on your phone. You‚Äôve already used the ‚Äúshe‚Äôs just a friend‚Äù defense in valid context before. Your girl knows you have ‚Äúplatonic‚Äù female friends, so now you have a shield if you‚Äôre flirting (or whatever - amoral) on the side.

Not only that, your girl may actually start texting and communicating with her orbiters / male friends less, since you‚Äôve flipped the script and put it in terms her solipsism understands.

A friend of the opposite sex isn‚Äôt just a friend, it‚Äôs a friend who you could def maybe fuck.

Use this dread to your advantage.",100,1

Recursive Preselection: Any Man Can Fuck Unlimited 10s?,"Curious if there‚Äôs any red pill knowledge about this. 



So we know preselection is the most powerful female attraction trigger by far. If a woman sees lots of other women want you, she desperately needs to fuck you so she can feel superior to them. PUA, redpill, MGTOW all agrees with this. 

So, what if you were to start orbiting a ton of 9s and 10s? Not buying them shit, but simply being friends. Whatever you would do with normal friends, you now invite them along.  I personally would probably outsource all the texting to overseas workers for like $2 an hour, or use GPT3 to do it. Either way, you have built platonic relationships with 10-20 hot women, 9 s and 10s. 


Now, if anyone checks your social media or spends any time with you they‚Äôll notice you‚Äôre always surrounded by super attractive women. When the girl creeping on your tinder sees your IG she‚Äôll wonder how you‚Äôre with so many hot women. If you say they‚Äôre just your friends, it‚Äôs even better because it seems like you‚Äôre lying. 


By being surrounded by 10s your SMV is now 10 to women because of their need to compete. And once the 10s you‚Äôre orbiting see you starting to fuck other 10s they‚Äôll feel like they‚Äôre in competition too. They will probably start to offer sex to you. 



This is completely theory, haven‚Äôt tried it, but all the redpill knowledge I have leads me to believe it‚Äôd work

Beware of the dangerous and covert nature of women!,"This [story](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/16/italian-woman-colleague-spiked-coffee-eliminate-her) just came out in Italy.  
A woman has been drugged for YEARS by a colleague that wanted her removed from the job.

From Lucusta, the poison expert serving under the emperor Nero, to Giulia Tofana who invented the ""Acqua Tofana"", a colorless and tasteless poison, widely used in Europe during the 17th century, the world most dangerous poisoners have been women. 

I usually dismissed such arguments in the past as pure paranoia, until something similar happened to me...

A toxic aunt tried such a trick at the wake of an uncle of mine that unfortunately passed away too young. 

Her goal was clearly to cause trouble and not ""calm"" the people that were suffering from the loss and NEVER requested any medication.

She always had the goal to steal the inheritance of my grandparents, and I wonder what was her ultimate goal on that particular occasion.

I saw her pour a whole two little bottles of anxiolytic in a single bottle of water that she wanted to use to serve water to all the people in the house.

I waited until she started pouring water from the contaminated bottle into glasses to step up and stop her.

I asked her to show everybody what she was pouring, but she refused. So I told her that I would take to bottle to get analyzed but his husband told me that it was outrageous that I would put on a fight during the wake, and his wife just told me that the medication was just for her.

In a 2 liter bottle, with 40 times the maximum dose allowed.

This happened in a room, without other people witnessing. This was my huge mistake because when I told the story to the family, after some days, most of the family didn't believe me or just tried to dismiss the thing... but after that they avoid her going in any kitchen at their houses, and I wonder why...",6,1

So Rollo Tomassi...?," I was watching his video from the other day where he addresses another guys video that went into the glaring problems of the red pill. The guy addressed the core problem I've always had with tRP, in that sure you can game women and get them to have sex with you and and get them to fall for you but then what? If you want a relationship, she will eventually discover who you really are..right?

  Rollo Tomassi, a man whose been married many years, basically said the man is wrong .that he does not game his wife but that he instead became the 'alpha'. So, he doesn't need to maintain frame and play all sorts of games with his wife, that he truly is the big dog that she admires and respects. Hmm this was at least my interpretation of his answer

  So Rollo is basically saying that his entire attitude now is alpha, a 24/7 dominant personality that will make his wife submissive to him. I like Rollo but I just don't understand nor do I believe him here. Anyone else watch this video he put out 2-3 days ago? 

  Thoughts on this?do you believe Rollo? i just don't see how any man could literally maintain the alpha for the rest of his life. That would be like having a second full time job",76,1
You Can't Force Someone to Like You," A tonne of us start out thinking that getting laid is just a matter of being good at *seduction*. ‚ÄúIf I say the right thing, act the right way, make her like me ‚Äì she‚Äôll let me eat her *tuna taco*.‚Äù Then we go out there and try our absolute hardest to win over every girl‚Ä¶ but we find no matter what we do, *some girls still aren‚Äôt into us.*

The stubborn guys double down even harder, wasting years and years learning more and more pickup lines, ‚Äúconversation routines‚Äù, ‚Äúnegs‚Äù, ‚Äúpush/pull techniques‚Äù, etc, in an effort to try and win over 100% of girls (which is impossible). The smart guys realise *getting laid is just a numbers game* ‚Äì some girls will like you, some won‚Äôt, so the only way to get laid a lot (and with minimal effort/drama) is to hit on a lot of girls.

**It‚Äôs like sales.** You‚Äôre not trying to win over every person; you‚Äôre just looking for *one* buyer. Getting laid/retaining girls is basically you saying: *‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what I have to offer. Do you like what I‚Äôm offering? If you do, we‚Äôll get together. If not, no worries.‚Äù*

You can‚Äôt MAKE someone want what you‚Äôre offering. **They either want it or they don‚Äôt.** A particular girl will either want to sleep with you, or she won‚Äôt. You should obviously *put in lots of effort* and *try your hardest* to sleep with her, but if after you‚Äôve done your best she still isn‚Äôt interested, you need to know when to move on and go hit on the next girl. The same applies to friends; you aren‚Äôt going to be best mates with everyone you ever meet. Just find the ones who click with you.

**Not everyone on this planet is going to like you.** Don‚Äôt worry about the people who don‚Äôt gel with you ‚Äì focus your energy on finding the ones you *do* click with.

I'm Getting Closer. Thank you TRP!,"Just a quick field report and how things are starting to finally click for me and I am feeling....Like I am finally starting to get to the point where chicks dig me and I can catch that vibe.

I came out our local Staples and I saw this Sales Associate coming out as well and I cracked some joke like ""I bet your glad to be out of there?"" and she laughed and said ""Yeah"".  I went on to say that ""Yeah it seems like it would be pretty boring after a while"" and she was like ""Yeah"" and smiling as I was walking with her.

During the interaction I could just feel like she liked me and I found myself starting a bit hard because I could sense the attraction and saw her looking at me smiling really into what I was saying.

Anyway I gently touched on the arm to get her to slow down and talked with her for a little bit longer and I think I could have gone further but I thought she was going into the grocery store (The same as I was) and I didn't want to be ""A bother"" but it turned out she was going home (I asked her earlier and it just didn't register in my head) and I think with just a bit more escalation I could I have got her to go with me and could have banged.

So that's it but I did want to thank you guys that all that stuff about being confident, taking control and all of the other facets of the Red Pill are starting to work in my life.

"We need technology for a freer internet (men's rights, conservatives being shut down)","We need a ""Free speech"" form of the internet. Without being crime-infested like the darkweb. You don't want a search for men's rights to come along next to drugs, assassinations and CP. Especially considering that most people for men's rights want a healthier society with less crime.

So we need a ""free-speech"" internet that promotes healthy discussion... untraceable and unblockable.

Heres my idea:

&amp;#x200B;

We use a TOR-like technology. A social-TOR, where your search results are filtered according to a list of ""people whose opinions you value"". In this way, it becomes a lot more like real life. You are more likely to be talking to and listening to people you value. In real life, you aren't going to be hanging around people you hate (by choice).

Basically, you can ""form networks"" of people whose opinions you value. But everyone is anonymous.

So if I value Jerry's opinions... but Jerry blocks some feminists... that makes me less likely to SEE those feminists when I search for anything.

This way... we get a cleaner internet, without censorship.

The idea is to collect ""values"" from all your friends list. For example, I could say that ""I agree with Jerry when it comes to men's rights, but not on the economy""... so Jerry's opinions on who should be blocked... won't affect my searches on economic matters.

If 10% of my ""trusted people"" are against someone, but 90% are for that person... then I can see that person's writing in my searches. Or it makes it more likely.

In addition, if I trust Jerry's opinions a lot, I can say ""I trust not only Jerry, but Jerry's taste in friends"", and so his friends list influences my searches (but scaled down). This helps my friends list doesn't have people who care about a particular topic.

Also... I can allow a certain amount of ""disagreeing views"" per month. Let's say, per month I want to see 10% of my search results be from people I disagree with. Then I don't have to get into an echo-bubble.

We just want a healthier way to discuss and seach for info without having to go down nasty crime-ridden evil things like ""the dark web"".

I think its a good solution and should be implemented.",38,1

How to Take an Effective Tinder Profile Picture,"Probably the most common comment/DM that I receive has to do with ideas for Tinder pictures. Normally I would just say go read mallardcove's guides (and you should still do that), but after reviewing a large number of profiles, it seems that a certain amount of hand-holding is required.

Creativity needs to be nurtured, as does vanity; it took me awhile to figure out what angles and so forth flattered me the most. But I will do my best to help you get started down the right path, because I do think anyone can improve their results with effort.

# The Main Tinder Picture

The first picture that she sees in the stack is by far the most important. **Your profile picture is the single biggest factor in determining whether you get a right swipe.** There are four elements that make for an ideal picture:

1. **Clearly shows your face.** The picture should be cropped from the waist or mid-chest. Your expression should not be awkward and dweeby; see my post ""Creating a Sexual Vibe in Your Tinder Profile: Body Language Analysis"" for more discussion on this point. No sunglasses, eyeglasses, or hats; these things have been shown to significantly decrease your chance of a right swipe.
2. **Shows you are stylish.** Outfit, grooming, haircut, and accessories need to be on point. Wear clothing that fits. Trim up your beard (chicks dig light beards FYI), get your haircut a few days before. It helps to have some jewelry - watches, bracelets, rings. Take your sunglasses and fold them against shirt, don't put them on your face. If you're stylistically rudderless, copy some guy on IG.
3. **Is interesting.** Don't just be standing there like a doofus. This is probably my main criticism of you guys - you're boring as fuck. You need to be doing some exciting activity or holding an interesting object - guitar, camera, football, etc.
4. **Communicates your body type.** Ideally the picture shows that you're fit, although this isn't 100% necessary for the first picture. It may actually be better to save the shirtless pic for the second one in the stack, depending on your goals.

You don't necessarily need all of these elements depending on the nature of the photo, but you really need at least #1 and 2/3 of the rest. 

**Example**

[Zach](https://www.tinderseduction.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Good-tinder-pictures.png) was one of the most right-swiped Tinder men in the United States several years ago. Obviously he's incredibly handsome, but we'll leave that aside. As you can see, this picture hits 3 out of 4 of the above elements. It clearly shows his face, it's exciting, and it communicates his body type. Obviously ""style"" doesn't necessarily apply here, although we can see that he's well-groomed.

You can easily look up more examples on your own. Tinder occasionally releases its most popular users.

# Execution

**I'm not going to post my Tinder pictures, so please don't DM me for them or demand that I show you in the comments.** But I will tell you that my main picture shows me standing with the city skyline in the background. I'm wearing a black shirt ($10 at H&amp;M), white pants ($20 at Nordstrom Rack), watch (Timex), and sunglasses (cheap Amazon knockoff) folded against my shirt. I'm holding my DLSR camera (interesting object). My eyes are squinting slightly in the sun, and I'm smirking (not smiling). 

**Equipment:** You're going to want an iPhone 10 or above. Maybe you can get away with a slightly older model, but this is what I use. The dirty little secret of photography in 2020 is that pros are using an iPhone for many of their shots. 

You will also need a tripod, unless you have a friend to take the picture for you. I've gotten laid off pictures taken by my mother, but then again, I'm pretty shameless about my exploits.

**Lighting:** You want to take the picture during the ""Golden Hour,"" which is the hour before the sun rises or sets. The idea is that you don't want direct sunlight on your face. Wait until the sun is at or just behind the horizon. This will give your skin a nice, even glow.

**Angle:** I really need to emphasize that I'm no model; I look like crap if the picture isn't taken from the right angle. For me, this means that I'm facing forward, with the camera itself slightly above eye level. In my own picture I actually had to squat down in front of my tripod to get this right.

**Location:** It's good to have an interesting background. I took my picture on top of a downtown parking garage with the city skyline clearly visible in the background (thank you to the great mallardcove for that tip).

Make sure you take at least 30 pictures. If you're lucky, a few of them will be good. Hopefully one will be outstanding. Don't rush through this. Make sure you have at least a full hour on location, and get there early so you can set up. Try out different angles, facial expressions, etc. and see what works for you.

# Post-processing

**Touchups**

Again, having the iPhone 10 makes this a lot easier. The editing tools are actually pretty powerful. Use the sliders to adjust brightness, vibrancy, warmth, and so on so your skin tone looks good. You can also download the infamous FaceApp, which has some really nice features too. **These touchups should be minor.** Don't make wholesale changes. 

**Photofeeler**

Before you post any picture to your profile, get it rated on Photofeeler by women &lt;24. Aim for above a 9.0 in attractiveness. My main pictures have ranged from 9.3 - 9.8 in attractiveness, although when I first started out, I scored no higher than a 7.

**Hinge ""Likes""**

Hinge  makes users ""like"" some aspect of your profile, usually a picture. You can use this information to gauge which pictures are hitting in real-life vs. Photofeeler. I noticed that girls ""liked"" the aforementioned camera/skyline picture far more often than my main picture. The latter actually scored higher in attractiveness on Photofeeler, but I switched around the two pictures on all of my profiles. It seems like a small detail, but I've been doing even better now that I've optimized based on this real-life feedback.

# Read This Before You Comment

**Male models.** 

Invariably I'm going to get some comment that male models have it easy on Tinder. Hey dummy - did you forget that male models always post high-quality photos, and that they're thoughtful about how they're coming across in the picture? Because that's what this post is about. 

**Take the Neck Pill (and Lift).**

Every asshat in the Black Pill complains that it's all about face. Well guess what? Lifting improves your face. My own face changed dramatically around age 23/24 when I started working out hard, to the point where this girl that I banged a few weeks ago joked that I ""stole that guy's identity"" when I showed her an old college picture.

Poor body composition shows up in fat deposits in your face, even when you're ""skinny fat."" A weak neck also throws off your proportions dramatically (Google ""Channing Tatum neck photoshop""). Don't skip your deadlifts and overhead presses.

**Be Realistic.** 

Even Tinder's most right-swiped man in 2017 ""only"" got 14,000 matches over two years. Maybe he was only swiping right on hot girls, but that still isn't a lot compared with the quantity and quality of matches that the *average* girl receives in a year.

On Tinder, you will succeed with some of the girls, some of the time. You will not succeed with all of the girls, all of the time. If you're banging even 5% of your matches who are at least HB6, then you're doing pretty well in my book. 

**Competition is greater than ever.** 

Everyone and their mother is on a dating app now. And thanks to advice that guys like me provide *gratis*, dudes are getting savvier about Tinder. Even I have noticed a meaningful decrease in my bang rate vis-a-vis the number of matches. If you aren't improving constantly, you're dead in the water. That goes for Tinder and life in general. 

# Final Word

Guys have contacted me to let me know that my dating app advice works. I know what I'm talking about.

**When I first started off with Tinder, I was getting no matches. Literally zero.** This isn't complicated, but it does take effort. Not only do you need to develop your physical appearance, but you also must cultivate an eye for style and what flatters your face and body. 

Hopefully this helps give you some ideas.",160,1

Emotion is energy in motion. Direct it wisely.,"This post is inspired by RedPillSchool's post on anger.  


I was going to respond, but I found my answer broadening in scope, so I felt it warranted its own OP.  


TLDR: A lot of people feel mastering ones' emotion is done by supressing them, or not allowing oneself to feel them. Or, like a lot of buddhists, stew in them until they eventually subside, but not taking action.   
IMO, bot it wrong.  


eMotion is energy in motion. And like all energy, if directed at the right target, it becomes incredibly useful. If energy is properly and proctively put to use, peace and abundance will be the results.  


If a sudden onslought of rain ruins your convertables seats, you can get angry towards the rain all you want. It just keeps pouring over your precious leather, indifferent to you. You should be angry at yourself, because you were a careless idiot.  


Likewise, if your wife chews you out for the slightest mistakes and you are angry with yourself because you can't seem to get shit right...  
... maaayyyyybe entertain the notion that your work is actually good enough and your wife can go fuck herself.  


Behavioral patterns of misdirecting emotions are buried in the limbic system. They are observable in monkeys and even better in human teenagers.   
They have a hidden short term benefit: It helps us ""keep face"" with others and ourselves.   


Misdirecting emotions is like eating empty carbs for your psyche. And, ironically, eating empty carbs is a pattern of emotional misdirection.

The guy who yells at the rain never has to face the realization he is an idiot. And the complacent husband never has to go through the actual work of becoming a man who has more options than a nagging hag.   


Once your emotions flow into the proper direction, you will unlock tremendous power and your true strength. Correspondingly, if someone is able to not only invoke your emotions, but also direct their flow, he will seize all your power.  


This is what politicians (and women) do if they want to control the masses. Evoke emotion. Direct it at a target.  


This is why you need a mission.  


It evokes your won emotions and directs them in a productive manner.",26,1

Anger is not a phase.,"I see the term ""anger phase"" bandied around a lot, and it's always rubbed me the wrong way. It implies that anger is something bad, a cancer of some sort. When you have it, you want to get rid of it as quickly as possible and move on to acceptance. 

This is the emotional equivalent of letting bullies take your lunch money to prevent feeling pain. Acceptance as a means to achieve some higher Zen is not an admirable quality when it comes at a real cost to you. Pretending you've ascended to a higher plane of existence is a cope.

The mark of a man is not which emotions he has and which he ignores. The mark of a man is how he chooses to act in light of his emotions. Holding frame (TRP's golden calf if you ask me) does not mean stifling or pretending one does not have emotions (faux stoicism). It does not mean admonishing others for experiencing it. 

Anger is one of the best catalysts for change. As with all of your emotions, it's important not to cede control to your anger, but it is similarly unwise to dismiss or hide from it. Anger, when properly directed, can be exactly the fire you need to get off your ass and make changes in your life.

Get angry at your lazy self. Get angry at fatness. Get angry at weakness. Get angry that others are successful and you are not. GET ANGRY.


I hear you say, ‚Äúonce you understand the rules, you don't get angry,‚Äù and , ‚Äúif you understand how the game works, you don't get angry because you accept it.‚Äù

But mating is a zero sum game. LIFE is a zero sum game. If you're playing defense and the other team scores, you don't sit down and accept it, resigned to a life of loserdom. No! You get angry. You get energized. You get invigorated to play harder. You want to win the game and you use that energy to focus on achieving your goals.

People get lost in the rhetoric because they envision somebody stewing over things that make them angry, getting hotter and hotter under the collar but doing nothing to relieve the anger. They call it a phase because ultimately when you do something constructive with it, the anger subsides. Sitting around angry doesn't help anybody. (nor does sitting around sad, or jealous, or any other emotion).

But it‚Äôs being used differently here. They say: *once you swallow the pill you leave the anger behind and what you have left is acceptance and frame. If you‚Äôre still angry, you haven‚Äôt swallowed the pill. You haven‚Äôt internalized it yet.*

**Bullshit I say**. I post, and encourage the posting of, discussions, articles, and news clippings that demonstrate the perceived injustices in the world around us because **anger keeps you sharp.**

I still get angry when I hear about a man who loses his family to feminism. I get angry when I hear about a suicide that was preventable. I get angry when I hear about a woman abusing the good will of others for her own personal gain. I get angry when I hear that a mildly good looking 20-something can afford to buy a house by flashing her tits on the internet.

I get angry because it‚Äôs the other team scoring a goal and I need to stoke the fire under my own ass to put myself ahead. They‚Äôre playing on easy mode and the refs are in their pocket. You‚Äôre going to need a hell of a comeback to make up the difference. **GET  ANGRY.**

Treating anger as an ugly emotion that should be avoided is accepting the feminine, blue pill frame. ‚ÄúReal men‚Äù don‚Äôt get angry. ‚ÄúReal men‚Äù learn to cope, right? Any time somebody suggests that your masculinity hinges on living up to societal standards, ask yourself who benefits from it? Who benefits from docile pushover men who never get angry?

Think of it this way, if you can convince the other team to stop playing, it‚Äôs a heck of a lot easier to win.

No successful, great man in history entered into the history books by accepting his reality as just-so. Every single one of them said ""to hell with this"" and changed the status quo.

The other team wants you to give up, and they‚Äôve been using social scorn, politics, and polite society to manipulate you your whole life. It‚Äôs so ingrained into us as humans that people on TRP unironically denounce anger as the ugly emotion that we should strive to outgrow and avoid. We should not be angry because that is a man who lacks control. *Garbage.*

Anger is not a phase. In fact, it's when you stop feeling angry that you should be the most worried. Not feeling angry means you are resigned to complacency with your status in life. Not feeling anger means that you are not truly living. Anger is the drive that drives the strong to go above and beyond the weak. **Anger is life.**",140,1

It was not until I became subconsciously conscious that I realized women also possess telepathy,"Hello,

I am a man without Narcissisms, therefore I cannot lie and I can do no wrong. To prove the power behind this, say this passage as if it were yourself.

Moving forward,

I am a human-quantum combination, born both conscious and with empathy. This means I possess a bit more ‚Äúcapacity‚Äù in using my subconscious along side my forward conscious mind without needing an unconscious false self in the forward mind to navigate as most men do. Due to this my forward and subconscious minds act as one.

I have been quiet most of my life about certain secrets, however, due to the nature of the world and the society, one cannot change anything without being a narcissist, however, influence is always a capability.

Women possess telepathy and consciousness at birth, and since both male and female are born with narcissisms as apart of natural development of a species, this often becomes a inter-species war if the wrong logic is incorporated into their mode of thinking, as the brain is sensitive to logic as a species continues to develop. This means, if you cast a stone during an early tribe meet you will likely lock those tribes into combat until a woman can introduce new ideas through her conflict to the right persons, however, if that woman is exposed to regular residual narcissism or suppression by the opposite gender then she too will also be considered unconscious within her environment, unlike men, who, when placed, will simply mirror their environment and can only think amongst themselves.

This telepathy allows a woman to, for example, call out to men, to come to her. Women also possess a subconscious advantage over men, meaning they can linger around in your subconscious indefinitely and with much greater effect. As a quantum humanoid, my subconscious has been evolved to the furthest extent possible for humanity, this gives me a perpetual subconscious celebrity status and allows me to view our narcissistic logic from outside-in.

I often ask women, via telepathy, because I possess no Narcissisms I am able to get through a woman‚Äôs natural sexism against men, and speak to them as they are, and truthfully, relationships require a great deal of resistance to begin, this concludes that the men I have grown to know have forced themselves into women, unknowingly, due to the dating mechanics required by women. The only way to get around this is to induce long distance dating which prevents the natural unconscious logic dating back to the development of our species where rape was required for men to learn consent from non consent, however, our society has pushed women into a position where men naturally assume they are inferior, thus subconsciously a woman will immediately realize you are sexist, and as a man, you naturally provide your ins and outs to her as well.

If you are conscious enough, you should monitor the signals from your neurons, why did you think of a certain thing when you passed by a person.

You may find it was never your thought to begin with.

Use this information for what you will.. I will not respond to arguments as I understand they are not acts of hostility, but a narcissists only way of initiating communication for this is how society has molded both men and women to interact, punish/pleasure.

Take care",6,1

A stoic take on expectation,"A lot of what is posted here about Stoicism isn‚Äôt inherently wrong, but it is typically incomplete. In order to fill that void I would like to talk about a stoic take on expectations today. 

Expectations are simply your determination of an outcome about a given action or event. If, for example, I drop a ball, I expect it to hit the ground. I do because every time I, or anyone else around me, have dropped a ball, that is exactly what happens. 


When dropping a ball, there are two definite things at work. The first one, is me, and my decision to drop the ball. The second is nature, or gravity‚Äôs ability to do its job, which will ensure the ball hits the ground. 


For a moment, let‚Äôs make the scenario a little more complicated. Let‚Äôs say that there were someone else‚Äôs hand beneath mine. When I drop the ball, that person can choose to move their hand, and let it fall, or to catch it. With this third element, I have introduced another component to my experiment that may or may not negatively affect my goal of getting the ball to hit the ground. This third component, I have no control over it. I don‚Äôt know whether the person will allow the ball to through their hand or not. 


Frankly, I‚Äôm not in control of the nature element either. The wind may blow and cause my ball to hit the ground in a different spot than I intended. 


In this entire scenario, there is actually only one thing I am in control of, and that is the choice I make to drop the ball. And, the more expectation I create for the ball to hit the ground, I create more pressure to succeed. If I expect that ball to hit the ground, an emotional reaction will occur if it does not. 


However, instead of creating expectations, I can see that the only thing that I am in control of is my ability to make choices. I can remove the external pressure I put on a given situation, the emotional reactions, and instead focus solely on my choices and actions. In addition, once I remove the expectation, I am not longer fragile or exposed. 


I can make the decision to create the experiment. I can make the decision to show up for the day of the test and drop the ball. I may even make the decision that I will not leave until the ball does hit the ground. But, I should never expect that the ball will hit the ground.",25,1
"Don't Hate, Appreciate","So I've got these two friends, Dave and Mikey. Dave and Mikey are in the anger phase. Dave just had a bad breakup with an LTR of over 3 yrs. He can't believe his sweet little innocent princess would go fuck that douchebag asshole former football player that treats her like shit. I had a tough convo with him about why she did what she did and was able to get through to him but now he's pissed off at women and their nature. Now Mikey had a bad break up with his LTR about two years ago, she cheated on him as well. Mikey, like Dave, was pissed off at women and their nature. However, Mikey is *still* pissed off. Now, he mental masturbates to the extremes of TRP and MGTOW all day, and acts like he knows the secrets to the universe. He'll still lift and get with the occasional woman, but nothing more than an HB4-6 with extreme mental or daddy issues. Low, low quality, and annoying as shit (to the detriment of our friend group). 

It's okay to be Dave. It's not okay to be Mikey. It's okay to be in the anger phase when you first find this sub, it's not okay to remain in it. Women are women, and they are going to women.  You take the naturality of women and all of their dumbass quirks that developed completely biologically and use it for the basis of hate. What the fuck is the point. While it is true that a lot of female behaviour is exactly as you now think it is, if you are only ever focused on the worst of what the women have to offer, you will only ever attract the worst of the women. 

I'll say that again, if you are only ever focused on the worst of what the women have to offer, you will only ever attract the worst of the women. So, why hate women and their nature when you can love them?

A lot of us are adamant about speaking ""the truth"" - bitter, harsh and cruel - about women, not realizing that women only act this way as a reflection of most men. Women are the other side of the coin, the yin to the yang. If you disdain women you inherently disdain part of yourself.

Look, women feel men out through a kind of energy, for lack of a better word. These masculine and feminine energies are constantly intertwining in dance and manifest themselves in several ways that we are familiar with. Think dominance and submission, shit tests and manipulation, yadda yadda. But what you have to realize is that this dance is meant to be complimentary. As men we're always in our own heads, but we think about ideas, concepts, rigid structures of reality, whereas women think about that which has already came to be, e.g. the meal she cooked this morning, the dress she's thinking of buying, the guy she wants to date blah blah blah. As men, it mindless drivel of little girls, but women, be they 5 or 50, ALL ACT THIS WAY. It is FUNDAMENTAL FOR THEM to be in tune with the ever changing state of their emotions and feelings, because THAT is how they connect with reality, through EMOTION. Men do it with LOGIC. This comes with a sacrifice at both ends. Most women are very present to the moment and lack the abstract thinking to provide a better future for themselves. Men on the opposite end, have trouble staying present minded, and generally live in abstract world. You can see how both of these sides of the coin make for a complete human being. One that is able to look into the future, and yet remain present to the moment. One that is able to create an ideal within his mind, and bring into present reality and be able to enjoy it when it is there. 

So do not look at women who have access to sex and think that it's ""unfair"", for you have been given a gift far greater than the external banal sensual pleasures available to any woman. Whereas a woman can only use a Man to create more mankind, A Man can create the World.

Women are chaotic, they will stir the waters of your mind and provoke you into a state of disease and instability if you let them. The man who has firm roots in himself and can ground himself is the one who can withstand the chaos. If your roots are weak, its likely the chaotic female element could uproot your entire tree and leave you in a state of desolation. It is for this reason that we say all the time how important it is to build up to an abundant, unbreakable frame. The closer you get to this frame the more you will be able to see through the chaos, understand it, love it. This chaos has caused men to do great things.

For there is nothing more endearing and satisfying to a woman than to help a good man become great. Of course, many women don't realize this themselves, and they will see a good man and attempt to enslave him to satisfy their animal survival desires, of provisionship and security, eventually feminizing the man they are with and thus losing attraction to him. But women must always be in service to something or someone. It is how they feel best, even though they themselves oftentimes don't understand it. So guide them toward this realization and use it to your advantage.

Again, if you are only ever focused on the worst of what the women have to offer, you will only ever attract the worst of the women. So start to focus on the good they have to offer. Don't pedestalize, but learn to love the shit tests, appreciate the manipulation, understand the hypergamy. Be the man of deep stillness with the untrifled directed energy needed to ground the chaotic, emotional female element. Women will love you for this and add to your life. And remember to have fun with it.

My tips," Alright, guys as someone who was a beta male/simp a couple of months ago and only dreamed of even talking to smoking hot chicks, here's my little guide of becoming an Alpha Male:

It's no secret that females of the modern world are extremely hypergamous, but you can easily exploit it to your full advantage. The most important thing, you NEED to go to the gym. Make your body seduce them itself. Also, get a nice haircut and style accordingly. Get some accessories like a watch/sunglasses and the hardest part is over. If you can fill all those checkboxes then you are attracted to the most beautiful women naturally.

Also, don't be needy, EVER. Being needy is when you put a female on the pedestal and think more highly of her than yourself. That's a big no-no. Always think of yourself as higher, not only compared to females but with everybody. Always put YOUR needs first!! You can always get another woman if you want. After all, every day tons of hot women get 18, giving you an unlimited supply of new fish to catch.

Now talking, you need to be bold and direct, let her know from the start that you are interested in her romantically. The longer you wait, the bigger the chance that you will end up in friendzone. If you do get friendzoned, then you have two choices, really. As I am really not interested in platonic relationships with females, I usually just say that good luck and leave or ghost her. Or if you indeed are interested in a platonic relationship you could stay friends, but NEVER try to win her over again, it just makes you look like a beta male.

Okay, I think that's about it, I haven't been on the game for long but that's what I've learned and I hope somebody finds it useful.",43,1
Red Reminder - Women Are Simple. Don‚Äôt Take Them Too Serious,"Women are simple creatures.

They are cute little playthings here to submit; to suck fuck and you, cook, do your laundry, and be cute and feminine, supporting you and your pursuits.

They are very simple in their thinking because they don‚Äôt need to be anything else. They never developed past that because they never needed to. 

Men did all the thinking. Men did all the hunting. Men did all the hunting. Etc. Men needed to have these capabilities because men are the primary drivers of societal advancement. Men always have been. 

This isn‚Äôt from a neckbeard meninist point of view.

Ever wondered why the conversations women have are always about their boyfriends, celebrities, new clothes, or something along those lines?

Ever wondered why women don‚Äôt really get, nor are interested, in anything deep, from how machinery works to the search for enlightenment? 

Yep. 

Men are the drivers of society, and taking women too serious always causes problems. The moment women get taken too seriously (for example, get brought into the workplace) is when shit goes south. 

The men in the past understood this. That changed, hence the head throbbing irrationality of women‚Äôs movements such as third-wave feminism and the false sexual assault claims of #metoo, which grow as a result of clueless soyboys who just *take women too damn serious.* Nothing you can do about that though. 

So, how is this useful to you?

Just don‚Äôt go trying to have deep intellectual conversations with women. Don‚Äôt go ‚Äúsoul searching‚Äù looking for the perfect girl that will finally understand you. If you aim for that you‚Äôll never be satisfied with your women.

In the relationships you do get in, whether platonic or more long-term, the way to keep a woman happy is to always *treat her like children.* Give her tasks and ways to please you. Reward her when she does. Punish her when she displeases you with a removal of attention. Train her as if she is your little puppy. Never try to talk to her about anything deep, she doesn‚Äôt understand nor does she care. 

TL;DR

ALL women are simple, one dimensional little playthings. 

The plight of society was (and always has been) taking them too damn seriously. 

They‚Äôre simple little creatures.

Treat em like children.",12,1

On Romantic Love and Heartbreak,"On Romantic Love and Heartbreak

I have had my heart broken, and I have broken hearts in exchange.

Although this was never my intention, and something I want to avoid in the future, it happened regardless. It is not something I take pleasure in, quite the opposite, I hate inflicting this pain on someone I cared about enough to get into a relationship with. And yet, it seems that this is the price that self-growth and breaking from ignorance demand.  

Upon reflection I find myself still thinking about the love I had in my youth. Now, love has become a science; I know what is attractive, I know how to walk away, how to avoid unnecessary arguments, I know what I want, and what I like. Sex is also a science now. I know how to seduce, how to excite, how to please. 

The more I reflect the more I think it was that innocence, shared between us both, that made youthful love so pleasurable and emotionally powerful. Everything was new, but beyond this simple fact - we didn‚Äôt know any better, we had nothing else to compare it to. I don‚Äôt want to kiss or make love to anyone else, I said in my youth; I thought this because I believed it would never be the same. And, in truth, it isn‚Äôt, but not for the reasons I believed. 

Now, I enjoy hearing different moans, I enjoy the chase, the honeymoon phase - but there is no reason to stay beyond that, unless I get to the point mentally where I am ready to settle and begin a family. It has become a conscious decision. 

This mentality does not sound like love. Having kids, and keeping things exciting sounds like work; this is not what I thought of when I was a child dreaming of a wife. 

The problem was in my innocence I was a slave to my beloved. I was a slave to her affections, her desires, and stopped developing myself; I was always trying to keep her happy. The innocence that gave me unconditional love is the very condition that blinded me from self-growth and caused me to push away the love of my life.  

She did not want her lover to be a slave, she wanted a man; and yet I was still a boy. A boy still growing, discovering the meaning of life, and what it meant to be a man. 
Now, as a man, I cannot seem to find that unconditional love I once had. Ignorant acceptance for another is outside my capacity, even family is not excused from reason and condition. 

I have learned how to take charge of my life, and what values I stand for. I have had different flavours of women, and enjoyed different cultures. I have expanded my horizons and know the traits I seek in a woman. But see, this is not unconditional. I know the conditions; I have a specific checklist, even if at times it is subconscious. 

Oh youthful love; how many times I read that you were fleeting, and different from all future love, yet it did not click how it does now. 

Love for the sake of children, love for family, love for companionship is the reward for losing unconditional love of youth. 

Not to say these types of love are not powerful and right in their own way; but I was sold a dream in my childhood. A dream that did not die, although its possibility did. This leaves a yearning, and now I am chained to a constant game of chasing, pulling back, spicing things up, keeping things fresh, sticking together for children, all the things that don‚Äôt seem to be the unconditional love I hoped for as a child.  

All the things that conflict with unconditional love is all I have left. And, perhaps unfortunately, no matter how much I miss the love of my youth, I‚Äôm not sure I would trade it for what I have gained within myself; and yet there are moments where this realization and power do not satisfy the pain that dream left behind.",67,1

"Are we all chained to Hierarchy , Elitism, and Authoritarianism?","I've been on and off this sub since 2015, and they only thing I really cared about was getting my act together with my dating life and getting my power back. It wasn't until 2016 that I discovered this sect of the manosphere was conservative sleeper cell. Which is both understandable and a bit dissapointing in that many of the views here are from people who are absolutely far removed from reality. I'm not here to argue politics.  What I am here to argue is that the moderators of this sub have taken absolute control over everyone and their ideas to the point, where one of the rules is that we have to respect those who have ""put in valiant, consistent, effort to bring forth ideas and writings of quality"". Their efforts are as a much of a meritocracy as our economy is definitively capitalistic. Meaning they are given the value that the moderators give them and we are told to except them or be banned. Just like we are told lies by the government, corporations, schools, and any other oganization that has an incentive above serving the community.  It's time to ask the lot of you to do some hard thinking about this community? Is it for you? or is it for the moderators, their bank accounts, and their bragging rights. What if all of us here are being told our reality by people who are very insecure who actually give so much of shit about what women in society do to them, that they created this sub and community for them to lord over? Turns out our experts are just suit wearing squares who are up to business as usual. To you old conservative dinosaurs, you can read all the history and quote all the greek masterworks you want, but in reality most of you are more akin to warlords and apes than you are to greatest thinkers of the early world. You can rationalize it all you want, but there is a line in the sand, and I believe this sub willingly crossed it a long time ago, and whether it matters or not the community deserves to be what it will naturally evolve to, and not some pet project of those who ""dedicate their time to the quality"" of an internet space that they themselves did not create the framework nor own. Like I said, you have your own website, if it really mattered to you would be there and not on reddit-but you're still here and its because of statistics that drive traffic which influence each of your independent business ventures, and that would be fine with me if there was any integrity behind any of them. I find it laughable and concerning that I could be censored in a community much for free speech for criticizing a man like rollo tomassi who could not be any more of an out dated, washed up, blow hard who gets off on playing power games with 20 year olds on an internet message board. or Gaylubeoil who is more than willing to sell his personal workout programs off the hot coals of a pandemic panic. I cry laughing over the numerous amounts of bearded militia proud boys that post on here worried about communism and that politically correct LGBTQ community is making america unsafe for them go about their day.  Why don't you guys get another 3%er tattoo and almost shoot a protestor on social media if it bothers you so much. Maybe don't take gavin mcinness so seriously? oh and to redpillschool the autistic rule enforcing bastard of this internet playground, who would rather ban me than admit that I thought of an issue in more depth and relayed to the community in a form which the majority benefitted greatly from it?  You can sit behind your computer and enact checks and balances all you want but you still have to look at yourself in the mirror every day and understand that you are a hypocrite. If you want to be a dark triad pyschopath and control everyone that's fine, but at least do us all in the favor and put it in the sidebar and save people the time. To the late teens and 20 year olds in the community whatever you do just don't be a douche and don't join your daddy's frat and then complain you're under rape charges because you and the boys had too much fun pushing the local slut over the edge. To everyone else I strongly emplore you to get up and start talking about whatever you want on a different sub. It won't have TRP on it because the moderators have created, saved, and privatized every other alternate version of this sub on Reddit for obvious reasons, but they can't physically stop you from sharing your ideas under the title of something else. AND IT WON'T be QUARANTINED.  Otherwise I'm not angry at women, and I don't care what they've done to me, and what they do to society because it doesn't really matter. None of this stupid shit matters and I'd rather smoke pot and play video games, and date girls with tattoos and vote for whoever I feel like because i'm not an empty scourge like a lot of these old, never has been, cookie cutter sellouts who are just in it for the money and the power, no matter how many throats they stomp on. And if in reality I suck and I'm a loser and I'm wrong and I'll never be good enough or pass on my DNA to successfully compete in the meta-homosapien cosmic race then whatever because nothing fucking matters this is all garbage.",4,1

"Diary Entry: 20:21 Mon, May, 18th, 20","I made an entry in my diary today. I thought this previous entry would be something of entertainment to someone:

**20:21 Mon, May, 18th, 20**

Hey, I reach you from a sober state. It‚Äôs been a few days since consuming marijuana, and one night since consuming alcohol. I feel that clarity as one should expect when fasting from those escaping drugs; for better *and* worse. 

I came here mainly to begin to talk about a young woman I see often enough in my workplace‚Ä¶ A mother too, as I learned when she spoke of the child of five on the bus parallel to my own seating, and slightly behind. I listened curiously at the time; but I may be lying there, maybe I listened without choice, for we were stuck in the same vehicle, and I hadn‚Äôt been wearing my headphones. Her partner in crime is a fat gay man, whom must suffer incredibly more than me, judging by his physical state, and sexual orientation; although there I should always be subtle with what I say, for I risk speaking the mouth of a hypocrite. But that's a separate conversation.

Her body is about 5‚Äô6 tall, and beautifully narrow and petite. She wears clothing which hugs her figure tightly. Today, for example, she wore skin tight black leggings, revealing the definitions of the crack of her ass-hole. Elegance? Elegance or not, my DNA gives not a single toss, and certainly not my penis. For when she makes a stand, or a stride past my line of sight, I can‚Äôt help but think of myself inside her, and her small body expanded by my presence. Even as a write, unintentionally still, I feel a flutter of butterflies not in my stomach but my ba‚Ä¶ 

I have thought about her, and those possibilities that exist always between man and woman, or anyone with lust magnetising one another. Perhaps we could play, and laugh together; all the while maintaining intimate eye contact, and forging an energy of great heights. Only five days ago we made eye contact for about two or perhaps even three seconds! Surely that is initiation enough for a life long romance filled with sex and adventures? 

But then I think of that five year old boy (from what I can gather it‚Äôs a boy, for when speaking of him on the bus, the kid seemed to brim with much energy, that of a boy) who sits at home without a father, or at least without parents (it is very unlikely, by what I have heard on those bus journeys, that she is still in a relationship with the father) whom are connected in a way by love, or at least by promise, for the young boys life, and the goal of creating a being more wholesome than one who suffers the separation of his birth parents, and worse, the dismissal or disappearance of his own father. And here my vapid DNA desires quickly subdue. Go away entirely? No. But subdue to a great degree? Yes. I won‚Äôt lie to you here: perhaps now I even think nastier things about the mother, whom fucked a man at a young age most likely whilst intoxicated, and still possessed the devilish audacity to create life, without real financial or mental foundation. 

Perhaps even the word whore comes to mind; but this word I battle with, for I understand it comes from a place of anger and even hatred, but nonetheless it prevails in it‚Äôs recurrence. The defined anus, due to it‚Äôs specifically engineered clothing, designed to pronounce the area where is designed itself to be penetrated by some stupid male, too unaware of himself, to fall into the ass‚Äôs trap, and maybe even create further life from the same womb in question, and thus further chaos, not only in his own piece of shit existence, but for the tragic child that is spat out from it all; all of that absolute mess which is the desire for sex; the desire to ejaculate semen from your sweaty, useless, hopefully infertile balls.

And that‚Äôs where I leave myself I suppose. Filled with a concoction of not only sperm, but anger, and hatred, and confusion. Wow, I must say this sober mind catches me each time; it‚Äôs quite fascinating this way. 

With all of that said, I will finalise by stating my future intentions with the woman. I will stare at her asshole if she so presents it like a baboon, and I will daydream with my monkey brain myself drilling her to tears, but I will never speak a word to her, for I possess a perspective of something closer to what is truth. An understanding of something closer to reality. I will no longer attempt to make eye contact, and I will wish the very best for her tragic sons survival in this hellish land that is the planet of Mother Earth.",16,1

Moving To A New City (A Reflection on 4 Years of TRP),"First time posting here. I've been on TRP for a bit over four years ago.  I'm about to move to a new city, and it has me reflecting on some things I've learned over the past few years. TRP helped me out a lot in the early days when I was 21. Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm going crazy that anything I've gleamed some semblance of truth from ends up getting banned, quarantined, marked as hate speech, given slanderous titles, etc. 

Modern American culture made me hate myself. My life was a fucking shitshow, and I lost decades of what could've been a fun life thanks to it. I still see that same culture at work every day everywhere I look, while groups like this become increasingly more difficult to access. I'm thankful I'm out, but I'm disheartened by what it took. 

Now that the preamble is done, here are some things I learned since then. Some apply to my life, and some apply to relationships. I hope they help. I'll follow these up with questions I still have.  


* If for nothing else, begin working out to increase your level of self-discipline. If you have no discipline, you'll be less able to will yourself into doing what needs to be done. Similarly, willpower is finite from day to day, but you can increase it by building up good habits that compound over time. Life is competitive to some extent, and you have to actively fight if you want a better life.
* What people mean by ""never break frame."" Shit-tests are absolutely real, and I think women do it innately. I don't think it's a malicious act; I believe its origin is biological and gets conflated with the way we socialize. If you really like a girl, it can definitely affect you; but if some girl can break you that easily, how can they trust you to withstand time? I've been called an asshole by girls who ended up fucking me later, and I haven't fucked girls who made me insecure from prodding at my ego. The difference for me was I didn't want to fuck the former, and I did want to fuck the latter lol, but I think the easiest way I've found not to break frame is to have your own mission in life and devote yourself to that. I've read on here before something along the lines of ""a man needs a mission,"" and I found that to resonate. Basically, stand up for yourself and don't get hung up on the little things.
* Sometimes your infatuation with a girl is an anima projection. It's a concept in Jungian psychology where you create a false archetypical projection of who the person is based on idealized feminine qualities you believe them to possess. This is the guy who's taught to treat a woman like a princess and then wonders why she won't fuck him. Women aren't anima projections. Any well-adjusted woman won't feel comfortable around you if you treat her like a God. Hold them to a normal standard.
* Be aware of self-doubt, your fear of failure, and your desire to control things. Self-doubt can show up if you continue saying you want to do something, but then you don't actually end up doing it. If you yourself don't have this issue, you certainly know someone who does. This is similar to your fear of failing. Your ego is fragile, and it has the potential to break any time you try something new. My father never resolved this issue, and both our lives suffered for it. Don't be like him. Be strong for your kids because their lives depend on it. The desire to control things can also play into why people end up not doing shit, but I found it more applicable to social settings. I would tend to shut down in large social groups, and I believe it was because the more people present, the less able I was to control each person's perception of me. I'm still practicing just letting go. It takes faith. You have to have enough faith in yourself to let yourself go. You have to trust yourself.
* Your problems are just opportunities met with fear. If you're at all highly neurotic like I am, you'll tend to be like P. Hoffman in Synecdoche, New York. You'll always find something to worry about. As the band The Books said: ""Enjoy your worries, you may never have them again."" And as Brad Phillips painted: ""What if something is wrong? What if nothing is wrong?"" Sometimes nothing is wrong, and you need to let go and stop thinking something is wrong with you or your life or others lives. It prevents you from being a fun person to be around, and it stops you from enjoying life.
* Lastly, the crab-bucket mentality. This one sucked to learn. I started acquiring the mildest forms of success as an artist not too long ago, and I ended up finding people who I assumed were close friends distancing themselves from me - almost as a form of punishment. This has been well-documented in the friends who smoke trying to give the guy who's quitting a cigarette, but when it's your friends, and you're the guy quitting, it can be hard to accept what's going on. No one wants you to show them up; no one wants to confront that they could be more. The best advice I found for this is don't associate too much with any one thing and don't place your value in any social paradigm. The road to greatness might be lonely.

Oh! Also, for anyone like me, at some point, you may have decided for yourself, no one wants to see you happy. The crab-bucket mentality validates the theory to some extent, but it's not wholly accurate. Some people have worked on themselves and genuinely want the best for others. If you have this same issue, try to address it immediately. You'll surely sabotage your own life if you don't. 

I think the way to do this is by being upfront and honest with yourself about what is and what isn't working in your life. Paint a picture of what you want your life to be and then address why it isn't that. I think there typically ends up being something you told yourself about the world and who you were when you were younger that perpetuates over time to give you some things in life but not others. True freedom is on the other side. 

If you're a millionaire but it's spite that's driving you, I could give a fuck. If you're acting from a default way of being, then you're not truly free, and that'll show itself in the distance between you and your son, or your inevitable divorce, or your loss of friendships, or the success/failure of your business.

Take all of this with a grain of salt. I'm only 25, and I've noticed men in their 20's assume they know a lot more than they truly know. Everything mentioned here I discovered in my own life by failing into them head-first and trying to pick up the pieces afterward, hoping to make sense of what just happened. I like to think I have a fair bit of self-awareness to discern what's helpful and trustworthy from what isn't, but I'm open to that not being the case. 

Here are the questions I still have.

* In what ways can I make myself more charismatic? I'm still on the extreme of introverted, and I don't want that to negatively impact my ability to build a network of people in this new place.
* I still have a poor relationship to my finances, and I've never been financially comfortable or even stable. Have you found anything that helped you?

I'm sure I have many other questions, but my mind is blanking after writing everything I have thus far. I might make a new post with questions later once I flesh everything out. Anyways thanks for the stories, laughs, and advice. I do hope the best for all of us.",76,1

Women love knowing they can break up with you and crush you,"Women love knowing that they can break up with you and crush you

I have grown up with two sisters, a single mother, and have had countless women around me throughout my years on this planet.  One thing that I know almost all of them have in common is how they love knowing that after they dump their boyfriends, those once men are crushed to the point that they beg them to come back or cry to their friends about how they miss her.  They love knowing that they are so good, that men weep when they leave them.  

This is something that CANNOT HAPPEN TO YOU.  Women want to destroy your manhood to the point that you cannot go on without them.  Once that happens, they will leave your ass sitting in the shit box that you created for yourself.  All the while, they are off having wine with their girlfriends laughing about the fact that they heard for so and so that their ex boyfriend hasn't gotten out of bed for days and has been asking about her.

Do not do this shit.  You have to be the man that doesn't give a shit if a woman leaves you.  You have to be the man that has his shit together at all times.  Not only have I seen and heard first hand women revel in the fact that they crushed their boyfriend but I have also had the pleasure of hearing women upset because their ex-boyfriend has a new and improved model version of a girlfriend lined up right after the chicks dump their boyfriend.  They hate that shit even more and will do anything to get you back in their vagina to ruin your new relationship.  Why?  I'll tell you why.  Because women are miserable if they are not destroying a man's life.  And what they hate worse, is a man who is happy without them.

Don't be a man that basis your happiness around a woman.  Be a man that is happy by your damn self.  Be a man that can be dropped off in the middle of the desert without food and water but still find time to have fun drawing big dicks in the sand so any rescue aircraft will see it when they find you.

Please keep in mind that this is not a woman hating post.  This is an awareness post.  Some of the things on this forum sounds like we hate women.  Granted, there are some men who are waking up that have reached the anger phase.  Sure, it turns outward and blames women but really this is just how we, men, deal with disappointment while being blue pill.  We whine and blame others when deep down we know it is our fault all along.  Always remember, when it comes to all this information about women, YOU CAN'T HATE A FISH FOR SWIMMING.  Women have evolved the skills to weed out weak males that will not produce superior offspring.  Since women did not evolve in a strength aspect where they could just overpower someone to get what they want, they evolved mentally and physically in a way that manipulates men into doing what they want.  From the soft skin, plum lips, and hour glass figure to their mental games.  It has all been designed by God to make sure the human race remains at the top of the food chain.  So don't hate the player, hate the game.  Learn the game and beat the game.

Thirsty As Fuck,"Lurker for 5 years here. 

I'm back into the dating scene and chatting to a bunch of girls. I'm fat as fuck but I started back into exercise with a personal trainer. I'm trying to do nofap, but I'm so thirsty its not even funny.

The thirst I feel is causing all sorts of craziness in my brain with psycho somatic feelings. I'm so thirsty I feel like separated from reality most times. I just feel disconnected. I give off (what I feel) are terribly creepy vibes, even though I'm 6'4 and girls have told me I'm attractive.

This thirst man, I want to fuck so many girls. And I feel so impatient about it. All this energy and aggression. I really crave the feelings and intimacy, like into my being. This thirst desire is so overwhelming, I really want what I want, I'm sick of waiting.

That being said, I'm monitoring myself as best as I can and texting nonchalantly, sarcastically, and being chill with my girls. I'm also trying to act laid back and cool with people as I work. But I feel like I have this ravenous beast inside of me, and I need outlets. Meditation doesnt help me as much as action does. I need more action.

Making yourself unavailable,"I haven't been on here in like 3 years so I don't remember all the terminology for strategy or whatever. There's a girl who I was talking to who snapped me asking if I'd cuddle her. I literally clicked off the picture as soon as I read it and then didn't reply forgetting about it in like 5 seconds and I'm not exaggerating. I didn't reply, not because of some long term plan or strategy or something cringy like that, I just literally wasn't interested and my brain didn't register it as important so I had nothing to say back. Not a day later she snaps me in a phroggy hat and a bra and says, ""Would you rail me in a phroggy hat."" That got a reply, lmao

I forgot all about TRP till then, then I thought to myself, ""some dude probably wrote a 12 paragraph article on this on that subreddit"" But yeah, I think as a freshman in college if I got the cuddle message I'd of replied hoping it'd lead somewhere, I'd of been too easy and she'd of curved me or kept me waiting 10 dates.

THE TRUTH THAT SETS YOU FREE.,"Hi. 

So, I think yesterday someone shared a post from this sub with me and sent me a question, asking my opinion about this subreddit. I have my own sub, that's the reason I have people who ask me questions daily about mind and life in general.   


The person asked me ""Is it true that when you become vulnerable women will no longer be attracted to you or love you?"" And he shared a post from here that promotes that idea. I will give you my answer but I have to tell you that that post and that question made me very curious about this sub and everything it was about. 

The more I read the posts of this sub the more I realized how men of this subreddit suffer from ""nocebo effect"" or self ""fulfilling prophecies"".  And I don't say that to be mean or agressive in any way. In fact I take the time because I have compassion for you all and I hope that this post will give you food for thought.   


I will give you now my opinion and I ask you as a brother to think about it deeply and seriously. It is my conviction that if you understand what I say here you will be free from your self imposed hell with relationships and women.   


First of all my answer to the question that the person asked me. **""Is it true that when you become vulnerable women will no longer be attracted to you or love you?""**   
It depends of your beliefs. If you are convinced that to be loved and attractive you have to be cold and distant and have multiple women at the same time then you make it your reality. And you will find people who have the same beliefs and the same reality. No one can deny that.   
But If you're a true thinker and seeker of truth you have to be honest and see all the happy married men who don't cheat and are quite vulnerable with their partner. And are still very much loved. In fact that's the only way to have a true love, a true love mariage. It is not by playing games or having beliefs such as ""I have to be fake or make myself something I am not to be loved"". If you look the depth of that belief you will see a very low self image or even self hate and self pity. This is not the way.   


Now, it is true that FEAR or fear based thinking leads you to weakness, depression, suffering and loss of attraction and loss of partners. This applies to women as well as men. If you are afraid of not being good enough, if you constantly imagine someone cheating or leaving you then you harm yourself and you create a realty that fits that mind and that position. So if you are ""vulnerable"" because of constant feeding of fear then YES. You will be left or rejected. It is not attractive. But this applies to men and women. Its not a men vs women thing.  


MY MESSAGE:   


**This is the ultimate truth you are seeking: YOUR BELIEFS MAKE YOUR REALITY.**   
**You are programming yourself into programs of thinking and behaving that make your hell.** So the first step is to recognize those beliefs. Of course to you they are truth and reality because that is the nature of beliefs. But still you have to be open about questioning them. As said earlier, if you are convinced that you have to be fit, act like an ""alpha"" and be constantly busy or whatever to be loved then it will be your reality. But this is not the reality you want. You want to be loved for being true and authentic. You want to be yourself and even vulnerable sometimes. So you have two options: Keep your old limiting beliefs and act according to them and make strategies that fit those beliefs OR you change your beliefs and give up on strategies that no longer make sense. Ultimately you will see that your way of thinking and strategy making is ruled by FEAR, so is your perception of women.   


**Let's take my example. I believe that I am loved like a living god in my relationship. I don't believe in any strategy of seduction, manipulation, games playing or whatever. So I can express my feelings to my girlfriend, I can be vulnerable, I don't play any games, I don't try to manipulate her etc. I do nothing most of the posts from this sub promote. YET I LIVE THE PERFECT LOVE AND MY GIRLFRIEND SEES ME AS A GOD.  Not only my girlfriend but I'm very popular as well.**   


**Why do you think is this so? How does it apply to all of those posts and probably your beliefs? The difference is that I KNOW I AM LOVED FOR BEING MYSELF. And I act out of trust and confidence. Not out of fear. Everything you do out of fear is bound to fail. If I had fear I would probably think and feel the way you do. I would need strategies, programs, workouts, theories that confirm my fear and that work based on that fear... ALL OF THOSE END WHEN YOU ACCEPT THAT YOU ARE WORTHY OF LOVE AND WORTHY OF A LOVE RELATIONSHIP FOR THE WAY YOU ARE.**   


**All manipulations, strategies, mind games have their end. You cannot be fit forever, you cannot be strong forever, you cannot be young or beautiful forever, you cannot be constantly busy and pretending you're something you are not. I mean ultimately you can but why would you make love and attraction limited to that? It is better to begin to understand the power of your mind and your beliefs and start building beliefs and reality that serve you. YOU CAN BE LOVED LIKE A GOD NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK, YOUR AGE, POSITION, HEALTH OR WHATEVER. TRY IT.**  


The more you think of this message and this truth the more you will loosen your old negative convictions and the more you will start to see evidences that confirm what I told you, because again that is the nature of reality. Your mind creates your reality and I don't mean this symbolically.   


I am open for questions.

"You are not a woman. (Mindset, Environment &amp; Frame)","##If you are in your 20s, your life is just starting. Chill.

This is something that I suffered from for years and that I wish I had someone tell me much earlier. I've only realized it in this year, and while some would think it is a very late revelation, I like to think that it is a blessing I found this out at the age of 26 rather than at 50. I'd like to mostly blame the media for telling me how much youth is important, and partially myself for believing that dumb shit &amp; feeling an insurmountable amount of dread from losing my youth to bullshit that was not in my control.

As a man, your early life, while being somewhat important, doesn't matter as much as when you get to adulthood; and by adulthood I mean early to mid 20s. Early years are the name of the FEMALE GAME: they get pretty, bloom, grow up, become highly desirable, cock carousel, do all the shit they wanna do and then marry in their mid to late 20s. Men, however, are different. They work in the other direction. Most of them are not that desirable when they're young but, as they grow up, they lift, they learn, they get talent and riches and experience that matters. This goes double for teenagers here: your time will come.

Youth Importance is bullshit media pushing that only applies to women, and has absolutely fucked up so many men mentally because they don't work the same. Women's prime is in their late teens to mid 20s, and they have options that men don't; which is why men who focus on youth get depressed. Men's prime is dependent on their success and age which is, on average, in their mid 20s to late 30s; with some men never losing their prime. Never forget that.

##Lifting is very fucking important. Do not use bullshit examples of Pretty Model Boys to cope.

This is something I've recently seen when it comes to modern men, and I blame Instagram / Twitter Culture for it. They start saying how they're too short to lift, or how only looks matter and lifting is ass, or how ""gymcel is coping and you only lift weights and eat chicken to hopelessly find someone to love you"". If you think that, that's great and all but you don't know shit so maybe stop talking out your ass and find out where your mouth is.

Men tell men to lift because it works. Lifting is masculine, and looking good can be one of the biggest confidence boosters you will ever have. I had a shitty upbringing where I was a fat, weak loser and I would like to thank lifting for getting me to where I am right now. I thank it for being able to walk without suffering, I thank it for being able to have women turn their heads and see me as attractive, I thank it for the pain that I don't have &amp; that my father does at his weight, and I thank it for letting me get through COVID with no less than a bit of a fever and some sweating.

Having muscles on and looking good is important, and any man who says otherwise is naive or doesn't mean you well. Francisco Lachowski once said: ""Why lift weights when it is all about your face?"". Francisco Lachowski is now in the gym working out and punching bags because his looks are fading. Aging pretty boys often look like dog shit when they stay lanky and their skin turns to ballsacks because they decided that being a feminine boy is more important than being a masculine Alpha. There's a reason why Nature is a MOTHER and Time is a FATHER. It will smack you; hard.

There are numerous reasons why lifting is a must. This is because:

a) Some men will pick on softies. Most men will leave you alone but some men will try to shit on you if they think you're not a threat. I've seen a video where a guy picked up a skinny guy from a bar and carried him like a child  to take his place. He would have not tried that if the man was built strong. By lifting and looking tough, you aren't being a target. AMOGing starts on the first glance, and a man who is lanky is 99/100 times not doing the AMOG. You will get respect from men which equals social proof. Men respect men who lift, and don't usually fuck with guys who they think are tough.

b) Women just love muscles. I'm a man so I'm not gonna beat around the bush like a woman saying I'm putting on lipstick and making my boobs bigger and my ass tighter for oThEr WoMeN. I lift for the women, too, because I wanna look good and have her touching my muscles while I'm pounding her pussy; and to be good looking at the club. Lifting is an ego boost, so Deal With It. I know a lot of you will say that ""lifting for women is beta"" but I don't care and I know most of you lift so women would drool over your Adonis like body so stop fronting.

c) Being healthy &amp; fit is just nice, and being able to eat more food without worrying like a Victoria's Secret model is a bonus. I put health last because, to tell you the truth, I like it but don't really give that much of a shit about it. It's nice to stay out of the hospital but I also lift so I could eat and drink more shit which is sometimes unhealthy. Some of you say that health is #1, and then shoot T in your assholes and do a bunch of unhealthy shit. I'm direct and forward, and I don't try to dance around it. I'm not about to trade my youth for being a healthy 60 year old loser.

So lift, because it works and it is good for you. Lifting is a core thing that helps keep you in your prime, but..

##You still need to approach women. Lifting without approaching is like winning a lottery ticket and never cashing it in.

There's a trope that exists with men who lift, and it says that men expect women to be all over them when they get buff but often have just men telling them ""nice muscles bro"". This happens because men lift to look good but fail to use that shit to their advantage and hook up with women. You have to go out and get yourself out there. Lifting simply makes it easier and makes you more confident. If you don't use it, you are wasting it. Feminism might exist and women might talk shit about equality, but they ALL want to be approached by a fit looking tough man because a) it makes them feel desirable &amp; b) approaching is risky, shitty and can hurt your ego; ergo put your man pants on.

Like I said, lifting is important. It's only half of the puzzle, though. Looks are important but average looks &amp; good game beats nice looks &amp; no game. That is why..

##GAME is the name of the game. Experience matters.

Game is why men have a late prime and women have an early prime. Female game is LOOKS and ATTITUDE. They don't need game, they sit there looking pretty, acting sweet, and men come for an ""interview"". Male game is EXPERIENCE and STRENGTH. If you have lifting covered, you have the strength part covered. Experience is something that is invaluable and incredibly important. Observe any girl who likes a man older than them by half a decade (the vast majority of them) and they will all show you that they like them for their experience and what they are able to do.

And this is the absolute major key to success and something that most men don't want to hear because it implies responsibility. I don't care how shitty you look, I will tell you what women want to hear and what makes them fucking tingle: when a man says **""I can do that""**. Those four words are top of the shelf. There's a reason why women LOVE fixer uppers; because they're guys who know how to do shit and that shit is manly and attractive. Lizard Brain fires up when a man just KNOWS. ""I can do that"" is one of the biggest turn ons that you can display to a woman: you can fix shit around the house, you can make her laugh, you can fight, you can do this and that etc. If you are a man who can do ANYTHING, you are incredibly valuable to women AND men, and this is incredibly important because it is something that you can work on and that is in your ability to do so. Also, I'd like to say that if a man comes at me saying ""oh I can do so many things and yet no one wants me"", he should expect a reply saying ""you can't attract a woman, therefore you can't do something, so don't overestimate yourself"".

Now, let me say that looks will impact the way you get shit testing responses &amp; how much; this is true. At the end of the day, all you have to do is pass that shit because..

##Shit Testing is good and natural. If it pisses you off, you have a feminine mindset.

&gt;There are only two kinds of programming languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.

The vast majority of men that women like get shit tested to some degree. The only people I can think of that don't get shit tested are very famous people who women have already assessed that they wanna fuck and get attention + riches from, and shit testing could fuck it up. Ask the Chad that bangs women and gets pussy, and he will tell you that he gets some level of a shit test: women implying they're being taken advantage of, calling them a fuckboy, saying other snarky shit, asking if they're the only girl they're talking to etc. Really, just ask any experienced TRP man what women say moments before they're bent over. They do this to see how the man reacts.

If you take it personally, you fucked up and you should change your mindset. Hot guys get shit tested some, and average guys get shit tested plenty. 90% of men who bitch about women giving them shit got shit tested and failed; and the other 10% met a BPD hoe. Shit Testing is biological and merely a way for women to challenge men and see if they're able to do what they look like they could. Again, mindset. You're not jumping through hoops and passing tests like a monkey, you're showing a silly bitch who wants to test you what's what. The only other people besides famous dudes who don't get shit tested are the ones who aren't desirable. Candidates who don't get invited to an interview don't even get the chance to get the job. When a woman doesn't like you, she will stay away from you; and she will tell other women to do the same. Which is why..

##More women equals more women. Gossipping works in your favour.

Gossip is a man's single greatest double-edged sword. This is how a guy ends up fucking a girl and her girl friends: because she can't help telling them how great you've been (this isn't for you, they're bragging and showing you off because women) and now, women being women, want to have a taste of your dick. If they don't pursue you while you're together, they will pursue you when you break up. She will tell them all the details and all the intricacies. Especially if you've given them pleasure: women getting pleasure from a man is often very fucking rare. Even if you have an average / smaller dick, a woman will want what most men can't provide: tingles. This also works in reverse: they will talk shit about you and you will suffer. Therefore, if you're coming for the king, you best not miss.. but even if you do, it's no skin off your back because..

##Abundance Mentality is something you NEED to have. Hooking up with women isn't a competition: it is a dance.

Relationships are like a dance, and good ""dancers"" get attention. What do I mean by this? I mean that if you got rejected by a woman or a group of women, don't stress it. And don't wait for them to take you back. Waiting for someone to reaccept your offer makes you look thirsty and desperate. Just go somewhere else, flirt, have fun, show that you're actually fun and 9/10 times those SAME WOMEN will later on try and get you because ""oh shit he is actually fun and interesting"". Abundance Mentality exists by default in a mind of every single woman because they know that so many men want them. If you apply the same thing to yourself and show it to be true, you will get a lot of success because abundance = options = desirability (when it comes to men). Again, gossip works in your favour, and men don't work like this. If a man sees a woman dancing with another man, he will probably move on to another woman. If a woman sees it, she will wait her turn because ""who the fuck is she to have fun and not me with the cool man? thats not fair, I want to have fun too. Me me, I want fun me yes fun me fun"".

If all else fails, listen: chubby chicks need love, too. Why? Because women see that shit, they see the chubby girl having a fun with an Alpha, they see her giggling, they see you having a good ass time and they get self conscious and want a piece of the cake. Now, you can stick with the girl and tell the Stacy to beat it if she comes to try and claim you; in fact that is exactly what you should do at first and I mean DO NOT give up on the chubby girl. The flurry of shit is entertaining, and Stacy's lizard brain will like that you just didn't give up on the chubby girl as soon as she came back for you to scratch her ego. You can always flirt with her later. Just realize this: **women want what women have.** If you can't dance with the prom queen then dance with the grenade and better will eventually come. Being an interesting, fun person is worth like diamonds because..

##Being funny, and I mean actually FUNNY, is a skill that most men don't have.

There's something you need to know about women: **they're both bored and boring as fuck.** The #1 thing women say most of the time every single day before they're about to do some shit, want you to do some shit or just wanna notify you that they don't like you (rare) is ""im bored lol"". They want to have fun, they want to feel something, they want to be entertained and there is no shame in that. Guys have adopted this shitty mentality where they cope by saying ""oh im not your monkey"" and while this does apply to women on Tinder and shit, if I'm trying to be funny I am doing it for me and she is simply a part of me entertaining myself. That is, at least, how I see it.

There's a reason why Alphas tell you to lift and why Boomers tell you that being funny is important: because it is fuckin' true. This is how shitty looking men get good looking women, and how guys get social proof. Being funny works on women AND men. Alphas are fine and all, but men who know how to keep shit entertaining always have one of the highest social proofs in a group and is one of the greatest skills you can have. Being chill, knowing how to crack jokes and being able to take them and shoot back is very important and attractive.

Now, being funny is not that easy. To be funny: you need wit, quick response time, you can't get offended, gotta know know what to say, when to say and how to say it with unapologetic confidence; and you'd need to do it in real time and not over text where you have time to think up a """"""clever"""""" mile long response. As you can see, it isn't easy. Your name puns, Star Wars quotes and geeky shit doesn't push the button of most women and it is not impressive. Being funny, in real time, to women who you're talking to is impressive; and it can be done to great success.

##And finally: just work on yourself and never stop. The goal of life is to put Nihilism in its place and never quit.

To leave it off with some little wisdom, it is this: follow what I've said above and you will live a very nice, happy and interesting life. However, you have to do it, you gotta keep doing it, and you can't stop doing it. **Ever.** Humans &amp; animals in general are predisposed to rest on their laurels and stagnate. That is why pets, when given an access to buncha food, eat themselves to fucking death until they're not able to move. It is why Americans put themselves fucking disabled with fatness when given the option. This doesn't happen in the wild because it doesn't support it, but it shows the very nature of living beings when given multiple options.

Putting it simply, we are fucking confused after living for thousands of years as clothed apes, women AND men are dominated by lizard cavemen brains, and for the past hundred years we have entered modern life which promotes decay. Even at my young age, I've noticed something important. The default of modern life isn't progression: it is pure, raw NIHILISM. It is why women get fat when they have kids and don't care, or why already fat women give up on themselves and stay obese. It is why incels Lay Down and Rot, and stop trying. It is why Alphas turn to Betas and get fat and lazy across the years. People get too happy, or not happy enough, and they stop caring and give up. 

Finally, brace for a punch in the guts because this is something every man must realize: you can lose everything and you MUST be prepared to do so. Everything in life is not permanent. Your house. Your friends. Your social proof. Your fit body. The girls that like you and the girls you're dating. It can all be gone tomorrow, and you MUST be prepared to move on and carry on, or to defend it to the best of your ability. The goal of life is to work against you wanting to just fucking quit, constantly, without ever stopping. Father Time will beat the fucking shit out of you and everyone else. Everyone dies, and everyone gets their shit kicked in by Father Time. That is why people who were once attractive or successful turn into wrecks across the years. The real winners are those who take Father Time's punches, kicks, beatings and lashes.. but go through years, run out the clock, don't let themselves get knocked out and leave a fucking legacy to be proud of.",136,1

My experience with Online Dating Apps and why you should delete them all now,"


We all heard about reasons of why is bad to be on dating apps, the main reason is because for many guys even getting a match is hard,¬† I will talk about my experience from someone that has been in many many dates and was ""succesful"" with many of them. This why I believe most men should do better off. I think many can relate or learn from my experiences.

Background:I have been using on and off online dating apps for the last two years. I had more than 40+ dates during this time that were with ladies that I met through the different Apps. I was also still meeting people in IRL. I will say that from all my matches, at least 60% answer once,¬† from those 30% will agree on a date, and from those a bit less than half will flake the same day.¬† There are some weeks I will schedule 1 and the maximum I did was 5 from dating apps. Most first dates were a ""Coffee after work"" and the average time was 2.5 hours¬† I have had one night stands, after second date or after third. Usually I will ask 2 or 3 generic questions, or very rarely something about their bio and then ask for the coffee. Average amount of dates was 2, and the longest relationship I had was 4 months (corona affected negatively here). Of all the ladies I met only 3 I will have ""considered"" for a long term relationship, and only one of them didn't go beyond the first date. The other 2 were the longest ""relationships"" through these apps

This is my experience and what I have learnt.

1- All the girls were very polite and even when flaking the same day, they will always tell you.

I am also socially skilled so no date went so akward that someone will leave or something bad. All of them were in good terms.

2- If a girl goes beyond a third date she is interested in something serious. If you don't give a hint¬† or¬† pick on it, they will replace you fast ( optimization of monkey swing). Big contrast with girls I met through friends IRL that will be Ok going slower 

3- Women know the game, they will optimize and ask you for half hour coffees ( I guess it is to make sure you are hot enough). They will politely shorten a date if not interested.

4- Most flakes occur the same day and a few hours before. Some will offer to reschedule right away, but if you offer a time you are free they will ghost you after. For some I will re ask 2 weeks after playing cool and a date will actually happen.

5- You have to play their game,¬† you fight flaking with flaking, I will schedule 2 - 3 on the same day. I had to cancel only once one of them, and then the other girl flake 30 min before meeting, so I ended up with nothing that night.¬† If anything the game has become so fuck up for both sides that other's people time is worthless.

6- Girls are trying to disqualify you, they all are looking for a reason of why you are using a dating app. Girls will put you in 3 categories: the guy that only want hook ups, the ""not so good"" that's why he is in the app, or the unicorn. I feel is a great difference from meeting women through friends.

7- Patterns start to become evident

8-Girls will match you in different apps or multiple times ( if for example you deleted your account),¬† and many times they will forget completely that you match with them before. After 2 years, you start to see the same people or known people that you thought had boyfriends ( not anymore)¬† 

9- There are the women that only want to get the attention through a match or if you start a conversation. For many women this is not longer enough, they look for the rush of a hook up even if they are not really interested just to get validation.

10- I will categorize them into 4 groups,

A- The normal average trying to date up, they are usually Ok, nothing really exciting, nothing very bad. Usually not the one that you see yourself in a LTR 

B-The girl that just move in town or just broke up with her BF ( this group tend to be the best as are women that do very well IRL, but happened to just get into dating apps). Not so common

C- The girl with no friends / social life, this¬† one is a sad. Women that get ton of matches, but have not many real friends or hobbies so their only social life is through dating apps. Some of these ones can be very attractive at first, so you try to meet them more than once, but later on you realize they have nothing going on for themselves, you can feel they are lonely and some have no interest in anything romantic but will go out with you even if not attracted just to have something to do in their free time. 

D- The attractive girl, with a normal social life that you will think has no need for a dating app. Then you discover their is something off, she cannot pair bond with guys. She might be desensitized from so much attention and experiences ( + probably hormonal birth control, but this is for other topic) and is as well victim of dating apps and social media. This is the one that you have a perfect date or you hook up/ sleep with and¬† you think things went very smooth, and all of sudden she does not want to meet you again. This will usually blow my mind, even with all the TRP knowledge. This is a huge contrast with girls I met in real life,¬† that will not get intimate¬† if at least they have some interest level. Here anonymity and the fact that social circles are not related play a huge role.

Effects on myself and why I decided it to delete all dating apps.

1- It is a giant waste of time, I tried not to over-invest in texting or random stuff, but anyways going on dates or getting ""comfortable"" takes time. Personally I don't like to bring strangers home or go to theirs until I know them enough.

2- 90% of the girls I met, I was not really interested in or I will not connect or have any chemistry with them. Anyways I invited many for a 2nd or 3rd date because they were OK or for self validation. Many, that I will regret after.

3- You see the patterns, and you will spin plates just because you can but you do not really enjoy it anymore.

4- It affects your emotional stability, after so many flakes or hooking up with a new girl every week, because the one of the week before either you or her lost interest after the first time.¬† 

5- You see women as replaceable and they see you the same way. If there is something that objectify us more than nothing are dating apps.

6- You also lose your ability to pair bond

7- You become lazy and stop meeting girls IRL, you start thinking that if she is not in a dating app then she is not available. 

8- You go on dates for the sake of going into dates but you do not feel any excitement.

9- The energy you use to meet someone new every week is very large. You realize the importance of actually clicking or having chemistry

10- You start seeing that it is completely different the way you feel with girls you meet lRL compared to those onlne.

11- It is a roller coaster for emotions, it is no different from porn or social media. Unlimited attention and dopamine rushes, but almost no real human connections. Even if you are meeting in real life.

12- You use your free time with friends, hobbies or goals. 

13- I was not chasing a woman, but women in general. Even though I was low invested it is still the same.

14- Dating apps give you the same dopamine rush of¬† a like in FB, it is toxic and artificial. I felt better with myself out of it.

15- I start puting the effort to meet with the people I am actually interested¬† IRL.

16- Women have too much power, which they do not want or do them well.

Dating apps are toxic, for many women it is probably one of the causes of their anxiety and loneliness. 

Tl:Dr - Dating apps are toxic even if you are succesful, it takes out the excitmentent and humanity of inter gender relationships.",59,1
Most People Fail At Most Things Most Of The Time,"These words came to me as I was re-adjusting a younger friends head. It's probably old news for some of you, but I can imagine there are still guys that need to hear it.   


**Most people fail...**  
**...at most things...**  
**...most of the time!**  


**Let that sink in. Ponder it.**   


Failure is the default state of nature. Failure is statistically inevitable.  


**This is why we like winning. Winning is hard. And rare.**  


Most of the things most people try will end in failure. Going to the gym to get ripped? Failure. Learning how to interact with women? Failure. Making money? Failure. Getting a good career? Failure.   


Most people will fail at all of the tasks listed above. Yet, their own failure seems to hit them out of the blue - sometimes they even do their best to forget they even had goals in the first place. They can not handle what was almost guaranteed to happen.   


Now here is the kicker:   
**""Most people"" includes YOU.**   


Yes.   
You.   
You will fail.   
At most things.   
You will probably fuck up a hundred more things by the end of the year.   
And there is only very little you can do about.  


**What will set you apart from ""most people"" is how you handle failure.**  


Expect it.   
Embrace it.   
Cherish it. 

Because if you persist, failure will become the currency that buys sucess.   
The more you had to fail to achieve something, the bigger the success.   
And correspondingly, any success that can be achieved by most people is not a success - it is the illusion of success.  


Shitting out babies? That worthless degree? That soulless dead-end job? That little bit of cardio? Playing video games? Participation trophies? Being a nice guy? Having a (lame-ass) girlfriend?  


Those are not success. We try to frame them as such, but on a gut level we can't. If we are honest with ourselves - trying to do so disgusts us to the core. And it should.  


**Reject those illusory successes for things that are HARD to achieve.**   


And then fail.

Until you don't.",30,1
"Finished grad school and bought a house, all thanks to inspiration from this sub","No lessons here. Just wanted to say thanks to a sub-reddit and community that catches SO MUCH undeserved shit from the MSM that does not or will not understand what this community is about 

The typical liberal/normie view is that we're a bunch of masoganostic incels who are just angry at women/the world/etc and are looking to promote toxic ideas of masculinity, while dehumanizing and exploiting women.

Nothing could be further from the truth. The true principles (at least to me) are simply to teach young and aspiring men how to maximize their potential and set themselves on a positive track in life and accomplish their goals,  whatever they may be

In my case, this sub taught me a simple lesson: Time

While I knew it would help me advance in my career, the thought of spending two more yrs in grad school seemed after having to sacrifice so much of my social life becasue I was working full time seemed like a nightmare, but then I thought about something I read on this sub.

I can't remember who said it or why, but it was something so simple, yet so profound that it always stuck with me. The gist of it was that time will pass no matter what, so you can either have something to show for it or not. In my case, I could either have a Master's degree in two years or not. Such a simple notion, but it totally changed my outlook and helped pushed me through grad school. Whenever  I had to say no to a party or hot date, I thought about it every time.

All the while I stopped  wasting money on alcohol, drugs and restaurants, and spend what free time I had on positive activities like working out. Thanks to that, I was able to save up enough money to put 10% down on my first house.

I orbited her but in a way that I‚Äôd consider alpha. I‚Äôm aware this is an oxymoron. What I mean is I didn‚Äôt throw everything I learned here out the window. I still knew my worth and carried myself with that value in mind. I‚Äôm the prize. I still wanted her bad. She went hot and cold on me, couldn‚Äôt figure out what she wanted and this made me even more into her. I sent her thoughtful, interesting and creative messages when we did talk. Even wrote her a poem that I‚Äôm actually proud of. Zero cringe I promise. While she‚Äôs in one of her cold phases I post some pictures of a recent trip to Niagara Falls with a girl who is very close to me. She loses it and begins screenshotting our Snapchat messages. I tell her she‚Äôs going to look foolish if she posts those screenshots. I have no shame everything I said was in good taste.

They get posted and girls come to my rescue telling her how crazy she looks. As much as it bothered me I was thankful for the publicity.

FWBs with HB9.5 - Hot/Cold,"Brothers, would like your thoughts on how this situation has been handled, and opinions on what to do next. Been a follower of trp (and natural trp) for a few years but occasionally beta creeps in and then I wake the fuck up.

Have been nailing a HB9.5 for a few months. Incredible sex, and we can't get enough. However - she's in a ltr. Please don't quote me on the morals etc. - for me it's an extremely convenient setup. I've been so busy with work and she's always up for sex with no drama. Her bf is beta so I feel kinda bad - also I didn't think it would last this long. 

Anyway, problem is that every so often she will pull back.  To generalise, there are patterns where she will start to act emotional towards me, saying how much she'd want me in her bed at night etc. and then when I reciprocate, she will say she's worried she's getting too attached. More recently she told me that she had planned to end things every time she saw me but couldn't. How I typically respond is by saying ""if you want to stop, you just need to tell me"". Now, is this correct trp form as I'm getting like I don't care? 

Other things she does which I've noted in her cool spell:
- Rarely arranges sex (although has never done)
- Will generally message me first most days but rarely asks how I am, how's my day etc. 
- Tends to end interactions first (whether in text, phone or person)
- When arranging a meet, she's incredibly laid back about whether she sees me or not, almost where it's obvious she's trying to play it cool and feigning disinterest (infact, I find this a turn off) 
- Will tease by sexting and touching me in person but will want to stop after I've validated her etc.

To me, the points above demonstrate she's playing a game to try and keep me interested. But it has made me question whether she's losing interest. Mixed signals by saying she's too attached and then playing it cool with me. 

How should I proceed? Classic trp method and being more unavailable? She's quite insecure as with most HB9/10s so sometimes being too cool backfires. Interested to hear some thoughts as I'm a bit confused...",11,1

Why would you want to get married?,"**Summary**: Marriage *was* a solution to a specific problem.  That problem has now been solved by other means, therefore marriage is obsolete. 

**Body**: A friend of mine is going through a phase which seems common amongst right-leaning White/European men, especially those with above-average IQ's.  This phase can best be described as 'I/we/you should be getting married and having children because it's our duty to our people/race/culture, etc.'  This is usually a reaction to seeing the dire situation that our (Western) culture seems to find itself in, namely demographic decline due to feminism and the resultant solution of importing a mass of third world foreigners to make up for our lack of babies.

While I agree with the analysis and prognosis, I disagree with the solution.  Getting married was only ever a practical solution to one problem: how does society feed its dependents, i.e. women and children?  For the last few thousand years, and across most cultures, the best solution we could come up with was 'make a single man responsible for taking care of a woman and their children.'  We called this 'marriage'.  As the centralized state has risen in prominence, we see the decline of families.  The state has a direct incentive to raise your children for you, because the state wants to raise mental slaves.

Here's a thought experiment: if the state could raise people in test tubes and laboratories, with no parents involved, do you think it would?  The answer is obvious: OF FUCKING COURSE.  But guess what, they don't need to.  They've found an even better way of farming human slaves.  By liberating women from the shackles of marriage, the state has created a system in which women will get impregnated, and then figure out how to get a man to pay for the kid.  This is far more efficient than the government trying to produce and fund the slaves itself.  It's like the difference between FedEx and USPS: one guarantees your package gets delivered tomorrow morning, the other makes you stand in line for 40 minutes just to be told by a sassy black woman that you filled out the wrong form.

Trying to get married today in order to provide a stable household for raising children is a fool's errand.  It's like trying to catch a bullet for your friend to save his life, but that friend doesn't even like you and the bullet wasn't going to hit him anyway.  100 years ago men get married because they were forced to, not because they thought it was fun or their duty or a good idea.  Today, nobody is asking you to get married.  Nobody wants or needs men to get married, because the initial problem of how to  provide for women and children has been solved.

I get that guys want to 'Save the West.'  In a sense, I do as well.  But getting married isn't the way to do it.  Hell, there may be no way to do it.  We may be entering a new age of society, similar to the transition between hunter/gatherer cultures and agricultural ones, or between agricultural and industrial.  Maybe fighting to save what he had is as useless as trying to save the Native American way of life from Imperial Americanism.

\*Note: I'm not saying I agree with this system.  If I had a choice, we'd all be living in a hard right dictatorship, and our cities would look like medieval Europe on steroids (think Lordran from Dark Souls).  I'm just calling it like I see it.",81,1

&amp;#x200B;

This was my first mistake. You see, women weren\`t told as a child to not love. Their moms didn't walk up to them one day, showed pictures of beta billy and Chad Thundercock and explained how she is supposed to be a bitch to one, not give him sex and take his money and be sweet, submissive and slutty to the other. Women don\`t go together to the mall to have their nails and hair done, eat chocolate and talk about boys, shoes and alimony.  A girl doesn\`t wake up one day and think: ""hihihi today i\`m gonna make that beta guy in my class regret being born.""

Women don\`t see the patterns. Women don\`t think about their lives and their choices nearly as much as men do, especially not as much as men who come to the internet in order to understand these patterns do. We all have that hobbie, maybe it\`s the guitar, maybe it\`s some sport, or maybe it\`s a video game that just gets you ""in the zone."" You are not sure why or when it first started but you just get drawn towards it. You come back to it because you just love it, it makes you feel good, you forget about the rest of the world, you enjoy it and you could  spend an entire day doing it. It\`s a part of you, it\`s just who you are. It is exactly the same thing with women. They don\`t consciously think about it, they go back and stay around chads because it makes them feel good, it\`s fun, ""it just happens"", they get to forget about the rest of the world, they are just dawn towards him, it is a part of them, it is just who they are.

It\`s a dog, it barks, walks and loves like a dog. Just like a women. She walks, talks and loves like a women. She can be caring and loving, as long as it is for the right type of guy, as long as she is motivated to do it. She will ""love you for who you are"" as long as you know how to carry your burden of performance with grace, as long as you know how to have fun and be fun to be around and as long as you know how to be the right type of guy.

So... How do you become that right type of guy?

Extra: Changing your mind

&amp;#x200B;

\-First things first, just go to the fucking gym. If it\`s your first year at a gym, you should go at least 5x a week. Stop saying that bs about ""I don\`t have time"". Wake up at 5 am and work out before your day start. Work out in your lunch break, I don\`t care. If you have the time to play video games, watch tv or binge on YouTube and Netflix crap you definitely have the time to work out.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Surrender to reality. Accept women for what they are. Accept women\`s nature and surrender to reality. Turn your tears into lube and men the fuck up, deal with it. Then you can start molding reality to your will.

&amp;#x200B;

\-At some point, you need to stop ""faking it till you make it"". I realize a lot of people here will come raging at me for saying this, but eventually, you have to start being yourself. Just hear me out. In due time, if you have been hitting the gym you will realize that things are changed. The responses you get from people in general is changed. When you walk into a room, heads turn, when you walk up to a girl you see her eyes widening up and a discrete smile on the side of her mouth and when you tell her to suck your dick she isn\`t disgusted, she is flattered.

Your confidence is no longer the same it was before, you need to eventually change your mind about yourself, you are no longer faking it, it is just who you are. Congratulations, you became Chad. It is ok to not have rock solid game sometimes, game and The Red Pill is a constant learning dynamic, it is never perfect, just like your personality, it is always changing,

Women Are For Sex ‚Äì The Sexual Marketplace in ‚ÄòCurrent Year‚Äô,"** Women Are For Sex ‚Äì The Sexual Marketplace in ‚ÄòCurrent Year‚Äô.**

There used to be an expectation among both men (and women, for that matter) that if you stayed in school, stayed off drugs, got an education or a trade, eventually, you‚Äôd find your **[Disney Girl](https://archive.is/xlVcS)** to marry and have kids with, and live happily ever after in a [little house with a white picket fence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQEh8h7diw), a tire swing, and an apple pie cooling in an open window.

Let me disabuse you of this notion.

This is the state of women in 2020, in [fourteen seconds](https://twitter.com/i/status/1308193085071990786).
{Suggest watching with volume OFF or at least very low.}

Anyone want to wife one of them up?  Anyone want to put them in charge of mothering your kids?

I hope those answers are *‚ÄúHard no.‚Äù*

There are two primary problems ‚Äì the men and the women.

**First, The Men.**

Faaaaaaaar too many of the guys here are what I call ‚ÄúTRP Oreos‚Äù ‚Äì red on the outside, blue on the inside.  This got exposed, badly, in the comments my recent post, which I (intentionally) provocatively titled ‚ÄúNever Put Kids First‚Äù. 

Two things happened: 

There was a general freak-out as a lot of dudes showed up and promptly had apoplexy out about how you should *ALWAYS* put kids first, which explains, in part, why we‚Äôre producing a generation of anxious, entitled shitheads who have *‚ÄúFEEEEELINGS!‚Äù*, why the West is circling the drain, why our space program will shit the bed and why the America I die in will only vaguely resemble the America I was born into.  

Then there are the folks who evidently [can‚Äôt fucking read good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRPfY4mE4ME&amp;t=0m12s), because they *thought* I wrote: *‚ÄúNever have kids.‚Äù* I did not.  Go have 100 kids.  Just don‚Äôt be the dad equivalent of a SIMP.   That was Tiger Woods, btw.  *El Tigre* went from smashing some megahot piece of tail to being 4th out of three in her life after the kids were born, which is why he lost his damn mind and had to go fuck his way through a smorgasbord of pussy.  He wasn‚Äôt getting any at home.  He didn‚Äôt know how to pull it off ‚Äì not having a ‚ÄúBatphone‚Äù with a password on it that‚Äôs the same make/model as his caddy‚Äôs, boning his way through club girls and porn stars instead of selecting women who would protect him ‚Äì people in Namibia know what that guy looks like so I‚Äôm not sure how he thought he was going to keep things on the Down Law ‚Äì which led him to being chased out of his own house by a golf-club-wielding scorned wife, and her taking half of his shit.

I get she was hot, but really, there is no pussy in the world that is worth $400M.

*""His answer to every problem, every setback, was `I will work harder!' which he had adopted as his personal motto.""*

-Said about Boxer the horse, in *Animal Farm.*

Most guys here, particularly those early in their journey, need to stop projecting their bluepill fantasies on to Thots.  The conditioning that there is ‚ÄúOne Special Girl‚Äù is so difficult to eradicate.  They will be the plow horse and double down and double down until they have won their Maiden Fair ‚Äì usually after she‚Äôs done fucking every drug dealer, outlaw biker and escaped mental patient she can find and has entered the Epiphany Phase, or until they have some sort of breakdown, which, best case, brings them here, and, worst case, makes them the back half of a murder-suicide.

When you‚Äôre young and you haven‚Äôt quite gotten it, you‚Äôre frustrated and you think nobody else is having sex either. 

Except they are.  

It‚Äôs going on all around you.  An old Tyler Durden post may be of use in helping you understand:

[Secret Sex Society](https://archive.is/XTc82)

Here are a couple of pieces by Rollo that illustrate how much damage can be done by the Blue Pill Delusion:

[Saving the Best](http://archive.is/XgGID)

[Hats off to the Bull](https://therationalmale.com/2015/07/05/hats-off-to-the-bull/).

Those should be pretty horrifying.  Don‚Äôt get sucked in by the Cathedral‚Äôs programming or the Dream Machine‚Äôs hypnotic promises.

**Second, The Ladies.**

See that girl over there, that cute, demure little hottie with the ponytail that you just want to take home and keep?

She likes getting pissed on.

The Erotic Mind is very Dark and Deep, and the very things some folks protest against during the day are also the very things they do in in the dark of night.  Feminism unshackled the Female Id, and it‚Äôs a very powerful creature indeed.  So much so that entire societal institutions (organized religion, marriage) had to be created to control it.

**Girls are made of sugar and spice and ~~everything nice~~ dirty, dirty, twisted little secrets.**

Even the 'good' girls.  And that‚Äôs fine.  Everyone is entitled to their own kink.  But we‚Äôve arrived at a point where we *shame* male desire, but the *‚ÄúWIMMINZ is WONDERFULZ!‚Äù* bullshit narrative is pushed. 

Guys tend to [project their own dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEnC5gwNAN0) onto their ‚Äú[One Special Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGRxmYXi4Io)‚Äù, who is going to love them in a way that they want, have a dozen of his kids and never cheat, or get even one stretch mark or complain a day in her life.  

Except she won‚Äôt love him in the way that he wants because she doesn‚Äôt know how.  

When I say [I don‚Äôt hate women for their nature](http://archive.is/6eMFD), I am not White-Knighting for them.  Our soupy, primordial brains are not prepared for modern society.  They are prepared for keeping us alive and selecting partners that will produce the strongest offspring back in the Bad Old Days of the Saber Tooth Tiger.  Women shit-test men, because they have to know that he will protect them (and their offspring) when the tribe from the other side of the hill comes raiding, and if he can‚Äôt even stand up to a *woman* how will he do that?

Thus, guys can either bitch about how **[Why ‚ÄòAssholes‚Äô Get Laid, And You Don‚Äôt.](http://archive.is/nso5T)**, or they can‚Ä¶what was that Mr. Darwin?  Oh, right: Adapt.

Do you think that, when a **[Slave Girl](http://archive.is/12qmg)** shows up at my house, she wants to be treated like my *equal*?  Fuck NO she doesn‚Äôt, she wants to fulfill her Deep Female Nature and serve as the sexual plaything of a sexist, masculine man who does whatever he wants to her.  

*‚ÄúThese hoes ain‚Äôt loyal.‚Äù*

So stop expecting them to be.  

[The Girl Next Door](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujN721ZUpiw)?

Yeah, [she‚Äôs a porn star now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPtglcZrh2E).

You get up to take a piss?  The [girl you just fucked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YrWsmlJSiw) is sexting nudes to Chad and swiping right on Tinder while you‚Äôre gone.  And if not that, she‚Äôs feeding thirsty orbiters on InstaWhore or OnlyFans. 

*‚ÄúBut Uncle Vaz!‚Äù*  you say.  *[‚ÄúNot All Wimmiz Are Like That.‚Äù](http://archive.is/LQS2C)*

They don‚Äôt have to be.  It‚Äôs not that *EVERY girl is doing that, but ANY girl could.  And there are plenty of thirsty betas in her contacts hoping to be that Number 1 Draft Pick when you slip up.

**Your Path Forward in 2020.**

The social contract between the sexes is broken.  In breaking up the structures of society ‚Äì dismantling the nuclear family, an end to slut/adultery shaming, free and ready access to abortion ‚Äì [the feminists of the 20th Century were attempting to free themselves of the perceived constraints of conservatism](http://archive.is/Ass3q).  The end result is what we see today.  Women won the battle but lost the war.  The pussy cartel (to the extent that it existed) was broken, which liberated *men* from societal constraints as well.  

Too many guys here think they are going to use Red Pill tools to fulfill their bluepill goals, that they will play the Game of the Modern Female, play around and fuck a lot (or try to) and then ‚Äúsettle down‚Äù when they‚Äôre 40 into the nuclear family which isn‚Äôt the sexual and economic sinecure that they think it is any longer, if it ever was.

And hey, don‚Äôt bitch at me for being the bearer of bad news.  The West is [approaching End Stage Decadence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2Fnet0y9Ts).  I‚Äôd do quite well in a TradCon environment ‚Äì indeed, I was present if not for the TradCon Golden Age, then for its Renaissance in the 1980s.  I didn‚Äôt create the world today, I‚Äôm simply telling you how it is, and not to bring a knife (TradCon thinking) to a gun fight (the 2020 SMP).

The landscape has changed, even if her hindbrain [has not](http://archive.is/epSGX).  Sexual warfare is more asymmetric than ever.  What is my *Numero Uno* response to whatever guy is chewing through his own tongue over some girl in AskTRP? 

**[‚ÄúIf you were maintaining sexual relationships with multiple women, none of this would be a problem.‚Äù](http://archive.is/MG9ZP)**

Fish with a net, not with a pole.

If you are not a disruptor in the SMP, [then you are being disrupted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl5yCSYufeg).

Do not think that just because you‚Äôre in an LTR or get married that you‚Äôve won and the struggle is over; in reality, it‚Äôs just beginning.  There‚Äôs a *reason* we call marriage Red Pill on [Hard Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZlxvn_jWgM).

Never let ONE woman decide if you‚Äôre going to fuck tonight. Never let ONE woman walk out of the door with 100% of your pussy supply.  And beware giving ONE woman the Ring of Power, especially if you don‚Äôt‚Äô want a better than 50% chance of giving up 40% of your gross to pay a woman to bang other guys and teach your kids to hate you. 

But hey, it‚Äôs your ass, Cochise.  Just don‚Äôt be an innocent abroad in a world that isn‚Äôt innocent.  You‚Äôll get wind up getting an anally-injected education, and it won‚Äôt be pleasant.

Amoral (Evil) Sexual Strategy: Right or Wrong?,"So a post I made the other day that was taken down shed light on a specific sexual strategy. Some people called for censorship, some were in beta denial, and some called for morals in sex (when women have proven time and time again that they are AMORAL sexually[AWALT]). The post specifically concerned tactics used to lower a woman‚Äôs self esteem in order to get her in bed. Not making her cry or want to kill herself, but still shattering her ego, before proceeding to game her, bond with her, and escalate to sex. 



Now I‚Äôm not saying I do it. I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not even saying it‚Äôs okay to do it. I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs a valid strategy. Some people come here for bodybuilding advice. Some people come here to find big brothers. And some people simply come here because they want to fuck as many women as possible as easily as possible. Sexual strategy is the way to do that. 


Breaking down women‚Äôs egos and self esteem WORKS as a way to get sex. It‚Äôs just a fact. The military does the same thing when drill sergeants yell disgusting evil things at their recruits. Does the drill sergeant hate the recruit? No. Does he believe the nasty things he says? Probably not. He just knows that to build up an obedient, compliant soldier, that he has to shatter their ego to do it. And women want to obey and comply. 


It‚Äôs not okay to JUST shatter her ego, that‚Äôs just sadistic. But if you JUST game her and tell her what she wants to hear, you‚Äôll have a harder time getting her in bed. If you don‚Äôt believe me try drowning a girl in your best game. Then try shattering her ego first and see how much better it works. 


So is it right or wrong? It‚Äôs wrong. And so is a ton of other shit about this world. If a guy‚Äôs willing to do this to get some pussy why should this community keep that knowledge from him? These tactics can be used against men as well, and often are. If you‚Äôre talking to a woman in a bar and a guy comes up and breaks your ego in front of her and makes you look like a bitch or gets her to laugh at you, she‚Äôll lose attraction for you. 


So shatter her ego if you want. It‚Äôs the easiest way to get 9s and 10s to sleep with you fast.",48,1

"Beware The Archeologist, The Three-Headed Monster &amp; The Entitlement Monkey","As we are now in the month of Hallowe'en, I thought I would entertain the group with a horror story: *""Beware The Archeologist, the Three-Headed Monster &amp; The Entitlement Monkey""*

**The Archeologist**  

*""Women make great archaeologists, because they are always digging up the past.""*

-From, The Sayings of Chairman Zatizev

So a buddy of mine who has popped up in a couple of my posts - **[AWALT, a Valentine's Day Story](http://archive.is/qLRiH)** and **[Uncle Vasya's Guide To Threesomes](http://archive.is/Uqm0C)** who was married to an ""Archeologist"".

I also refer to Archeologists as ""wound collectors"" and/or ""scorekeepers"".  They remember everything that didn't go their way and they enter it into their ledgers until one day it all comes pouring out.  

With regard to my buddy, a few years ago, his wife walked into their family room (ironic, because she was about to destroy their family) to tell him *""We're getting a divorce.""*  

Now, they had been married for 18 years at that point, so he did feel like he was owed and explanation or at least a reason or two.  When he asked why, she brought up shit that happened *before they got married.*  So shit that was more than 18 years old.  This guy has a good memory but as he put it, *""I don't even remember those events.  And when she explained them, it turns out that she 'won' the argument.  And yet somehow she's still mad about it and it's a reason we're getting divorced.""*

That's the Archeologist.  Nothing is ever in the past.  

I worked with a wound collector/scorekeeper. She would tally up every ""benefit"" or ""advantage"" that everyone got and would demand the same thing so that everyone was ""equal"".  By way of example, her ass was chapped because I *""got to go on those dinners.""*  She was referring to business dinners that I would sometimes host in NYC for our deal-makers with high-value clients.  Never mind that I had developed relationships that gave us ""behind the velvet rope"" access to some posh spots to wow our clients with, and that I had to attend and basically be the Master of Ceremonies, the Sommelier (I am a wine guy as are some of our clients, and I get put in charge of selecting wines for the evening) and so on.  In her mind, she was ""entitled"" to dinners because I got them.  Never mind that they were for work, and nobody was going to fly her in to NYC so she could go to dinner on the company dime.  

I pointed out that she was free to develop relationships in the city where she worked, as I had done in NYC, and worked clients with her team as I did with mine, but that would require ""work"", you see, and she just wanted the bennies.

**The Three-Headed Monster**

So another pal of mine got bought out when his company got taken over.  He and his wife took an approximately year-long trip around the world - a month in Tuscany, SCUBA diving in Australia, yada-yada, the works.  They came home intermittently, but when they finally got back it was mid-October of whatever year, so not prime-time hiring season.  

So he set up his own business, and soon he was actually doing better, salary-wise, than he had before.  2x, in fact.  But he was working on his own so she decided to get a teaching job so that they would ""have benefits"".  Never mind that he could have set up an HSA and gotten a catastrophic policy.  Doctors also accept cash.  I had a check-up once when I was between jobs and my then-doctor knocked off 35-40% and happily took cash.

So she got a teaching job, and went from being a happy, stay-at-home mom to being an unhappy, stressed out teach who was [surrounded by co-workers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goVL5dUykzs) who (a) hated their husbands, and (b) wanted nothing more than to interfere in her relationship with a guy who was a great dad and pulled a half-a-mil a year.  

**The Entitlement Monkey**

Some years ago, a friend of mine set up one of her guy friends with a woman we both knew.

Me: *""Why did you do that?  Do you not like him very much?""*

Her: *""Why?  She's attractive.""*

Me:  *""Yes, she is.  But you noticed that I've never tried to bang her, right?""*

Her: *""Maybe it will work out.""*

Narrator: *""It did not work out.""*

So this girl liked expensive things.  Expensive meals, so on and so forth.  So the sad sack she was dating was hemorrhaging cash and not getting much return on it.

Don't be that guy.

Narrator: *""Yes, don't be that guy.""*

So he takes her to some charity function that involved a wine tasting.  He paid for their tickets and there was a raffle.  His ticket won an iPod (they were a thing back then).  He was, ofc, quite pleased.

His date: *""I don't have an iPod.""*

Evidently, he didn't ""get it"" that he was ""supposed to"" give her the iPod.  He actually stood his ground on this, and it soon escalated to *""I am your guest.  That is my iPod, give it to me.""*  They broke up shortly thereafter, but she [was not going to be deterred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z9Cg46Nktw&amp;t=1m18s). She actually *called his dad* and said, *""Are you aware that your son is stealing people's iPods?""*  

She was the 800 lb gorilla of Entitlement Monkeys.

And so ends my horror trilogy.

If you are dating a girl and she constantly brings up her exes and how bad they were, or she has evil co-workers, or seems overly acquisitive, it's time to cut her loose.",18,1

Closure is Bullshit,"Closure is Bullshit

As a man, you don‚Äôt need closure.

A girl either wants to fuck you or she doesn‚Äôt.  A long, emotional conversation will not change this fact.

Girls, however, need to put a man they are dumping into a desexualized box and wrap a pretty bow of closure around it.  

By participating in the closure process you are helping her tie the bow around your desexualized fate.

If a girl breaks up with you:
Do not talk about your feelings
Do not talk about her feelings
Do not argue with her reasons
Just accept it and grieve on your own time.
This is hard.

Why?

Because a woman will never give her ACTUAL reasons for breaking up with you.  She will only give you society-approved bullshit that makes her look innocent.

She will never say ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt fuck me good enough‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too nice and not exciting‚Äù or ‚Äúno other girl I know wants to fuck you so something must be wrong with you‚Äù.

She will say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really busy with school and work and don‚Äôt have time for a relationship now‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre great but I‚Äùm not ready for anything serious‚Äù or ‚ÄúI care about you as a friend‚Äù.
Sometimes the reasons she give will be SO false, such obvious flowery bullshit, that you will feel a deep burning need to set her straight, to correct her misunderstanding.

Don‚Äôt.

You can‚Äôt logic a woman.
You can say ‚Äúokay‚Äù, walk away with a smirk and never contact her again.

Being robbed of emotionally dripping closure, she‚Äôll always feel a little incomplete.
Why didn‚Äôt he fight harder for me?
Did I really not get to his emotions?
Am I not as desirable to him as I thought?
Is he more desirable than I thought?

Girls have egos.  They WANT to know you‚Äôre emotional about her breaking up with you.  It validates her.  So don‚Äôt do it.

You want a girl dumping you to question her reasons, not verify them.

When a girl dumps you, you want to be able to look back on how your handled it with pride.
When you give a girl closure, you give her your pride.

ùìñùì°ùìîùìêùì£ùìùùìîùì¢ùì¢ ‚à• On Being Great,"# ùìñùì°ùìîùìêùì£ùìùùìîùì¢ùì¢

&gt; ‚ùù Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them ‚ùû  
&gt;  
&gt;**„Ö° William Shakespeare** 

 ‚Ö†n my opinion achieving greatness is much greater than being born with it or, having thrust upon you. Starting at 0 and working your way up to 100, by doing it yourself it is much more rewarding and meaningful. Things that are given to you by others don‚Äôt show any work or character. To me creating and then being the best version of yourself that's what greatness is. 

There‚Äôs always someone better but, there can't be another you. All the external things such as status, money, and sex mean nothing if you‚Äôre unhappy with who you are. I do agree that it's fun to have those things however, when we're sitting back at the retirement home playing bingo, we will mostly be thinking about what we‚Äôve done, not what we had. 

The idea of greatness is very important to me. 

Every person has their own ideas of greatness so have I. 

Being WHO you are, staying true to WHO you are despite the backlash. And caring more about ‚Äúbeing‚Äù than ‚Äúwanting‚Äù. That's how I connect greatness to my life It's hard to really find yourself, it's even harder to be. 

&gt; ‚ùù You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life. ‚ùû  
‚Äï **Albert Camus** 

 Greatness is up to the individual, as is life. 

To me being greater than others doesn't matter. I think we should all aim to be better than ourselves, not others.

 In my opinion, being a good person is a mark which is reached when a person can look at all their insecurities, doubts, fears, and understands that their human, as is everybody else.  

While a great person knows that of the good but **takes action.** Does not give into their insecurities and stands up to them. A great individual is not afraid to admit their human but also knows they can work harder and can always improve themselves.

‚ÄúEnjoy the Decline‚Äù,"The ‚Äúdecline‚Äù will end in the next 5-10 years. 2020 has taught many men a great lesson. In the next 5 years men will have shifted from a generation of bitch betas to men in recovery. The shift is already starting now, as things start to get more and more extreme and absurd, and many guys are starting to realize how blue-pilled they are and are actively trying to make a change. More men than ever are starting to hit the gyms. Soon, it will no longer be okay to be a weak man in society and those who don‚Äôt catch up will be left behind. 

     Hard times create strong men
     Strong men create good times
     Good times create weak men
     Weak men create hard times.

The stage we are in now is hard times. The hypergamous nature of women is taking them over, and it is weak man‚Äôs fault. Good times are when civilization is monogamous and every man is the alpha of his woman and the household. Hard times are when women lack high value men to mate with and therefore go for the highest value men who wont even commit to them. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle, and it‚Äôs ending now. 2020 is the year of awakening for many men, especially because of all the ‚Äúbad‚Äù things happening right now. This is all happening as a reset to social hierarchies and to give men a chance at creating good times again. Give it a few decades and many men will rise in power and be strong again. The change is happening now, so get ready to grind because your hard work and mission matters more than anything today. Being 17 years old, even with high SMV which i have dating is just not a possibility now. Every sexual relationship was not able to last long at all, and i‚Äôm blaming social media apps like snapchat and tiktok for that because teenage girls are even more hypergamous than the adult ones. Statistics show that romantic relationships in teenagers are at an all-time low. However I‚Äôm seeing many guys I once knew who were the weakest in the room suddenly emerging and rising in power and getting stronger and that‚Äôs how I came to this realization.

Red Pill truths written 2400 years ago in philosophy dialogue Lysis by Plato: Do not put woman on a pedastal,"I read philosophy and it is insane how many redpill truths have been written on and off in writings. I am going to start posting them here because they are very interesting and are thought provoking. This dialogue is about friendship and love. In this excerpt, Socrates (a wise old man) is talking to his friend (Hippothales) about why he is a fool for writing poems and singing songs about the one he loves in an attempt to capture them.

From Lysis by Plato:

*Socrates: Most assuredly, I said, those songs are all in your own honor; for if you win your beautiful love, your discourses and songs will be a glory to you, and may be truly regarded as hymns of praise composed in honor of you who have conquered and won such a love; but if they slip away from you, the more you have praised the, the more ridiculous you will look at having lost the fairest and best of blessings; and therefore **the wise lover does not praise his beloved until he has won them, because he is afraid of accidents. There is also another danger; the fair, when any one praises or magnifies them, are filled with the spirit of pride and vein glory.** Do you not agree with me?

Yes, he said.

**And the more vain-glorious they are, the more difficult is the capture of them?**

I believe you.

What should you say of a hunter who frightened away his prey, and made the capture of the animals which he is hunting more difficult?

He would be a bad hunter, undoubtedly.

Yes; and if, instead of soothing them, he were to infuriate them with words and songs, that would show a great want of wit; do you not agree.

Yes.

And now reflect, Hippothales, and see whether you are not you are guilty of all these errors in writing poetry. For I can hardly suppose that you will affirm a man to be a good poet who injures himself by his poetry.*


Later on in the dialogoue, Socrates wins Hippothales lover over by humblng them, and making them realize they are not as good as they appear.",63,1
Don't shit where you eat,"""Don't shit where you eat"" is a catchy phrase and at first it seems to have some common sense built into it... and maybe it does, but it does not give you enough information on why you should not fuck your co-workers. The common theme around here is ""to avoid drama"" and it works very well for that, but I think it is valid not only because of this. 

You should not seduce and/or fuck your subordinates or co-workers because people look up to you. People look up to you, because you're a strong, alpha male. Your role is to lead, to teach, to give example. You're a father figure, even at work and good fathers don't fuck their children.

""But I'm not that alpha and I'm not that old and I don't have children"". Even if you are a skinny 17-yo, a lonely beta in an office full of cougars and MILFs, those women will still defer to you because of your strengths or just because you're a much better being a workhorse. This is how things should be, how they always been. 

You're a man. You lead, you teach, you give example, you take all the hard work and you do it and you come back stronger afterwards. Of course it is perfectly possible to use your position to have sex, but don't be surprised when it backfires and then you won't have your position any longer. Guess what, people above you perfectly understand this dynamic and if you do shit where you eat, it means that you're not that strong and not that valuable to the company. 

As for power and women... women will find men in position of power attractive, but while you work... is the power you wield actually your own? Chances are it's being lent to you by someone more powerful, who will take all this away when things go wrong. Just think about it for a moment.

At some level, (ab)using your position at workplace to have sex will seem like a form of pedophilia. Children depend on you, they depend on your life and on your wisdom, just like your subordinates. 

There are more situations when acting sexually is not recommended. Gym is one of them. Until today I saw those situations and those contradictions as simply rules, without any understanding of their deeper meaning. This doesn't means they don't have it.",74,1

An Unfortunate Way To Increase Your SMV Instantly,"There are three Aspects of sexual market value for men. Looks money and status. This is a known red pill truth. And if anyone asks how they can increase their SMV The default answer is ‚Äúgo lift‚Äù, which increases your looks. However, you could be the most muscular guy in the whole venue and still get no action, especially if your face isn‚Äôt the greatest. And it takes 6 to 12 months to see any true progress from lifting weights anyway. 


Money is no good either. While it does help you have access to a nicer life, there are plenty of rich guys who couldn‚Äôt get pussy to save their lives. And, nobody really wants to go digger around. Even if you don‚Äôt give her money, it can feel pretty gross to be around someone who you know only wants you for one reason. Especially if you‚Äôre not so good looking.


So now we come up on studies, it‚Äôs the most powerful of the three. Women will gladly and happily fuck and attractive guy was status. In fact, it‚Äôs been shown that having a higher studies literally makes you more attractive. But what exactly is high status? And how do you increase it quickly? The short answer is bullying. 


Studies show that if you lower someone‚Äôs self-esteem before making a sexual advance of them, it‚Äôs more likely to be excepted in every form. Humans have a natural submissive response to bullies and women and she‚Äôll leave you people they submit to us higher status. They want to submit it‚Äôs part of their psychology. On top of this they are extremely insecure. They spend most of their day worrying about their appearance. Their ego is a fragile house of cards and if you have the confidence to knock it over and stomp on the wreckage, then your perceived status will increase heavily.

This theory is backed up by the fact that any red pill posts you see about sleeping with  nines and tens say that it‚Äôs necessary to break down their ego. Because they are so attractive, their house of cards is much bigger and much more imposing. Do you guys flirting with them everywhere they go. However it‚Äôs just as fragile if not more so. But most men don‚Äôt have the balls to knock it down. And if you prove that you can, they‚Äôll fuck you.


Know what exactly am I telling you to do? Hurt their feelings with FACTS. if you were simply walk up and say bitch you‚Äôre ugly, you would just come off as mean. YOU are the threat here, and if it‚Äôs you vs. her she screams rape an you lose. Or just says ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù and ignores you. 

Instead, the threat to her ego must come from somewhere else. You just have to be the one pointing it out. Ask her the last time she took a shower or offer her some gum and say ‚Äúyou really fucking need it‚Äù Before she was in unreachable 10 out of 10 would never date let‚Äôs say five out of 10 like you. But now she‚Äôs a stinky 10 which might make her a four or even list. Her confidence has dropped through the floor.. She now sees herself as directly equal to you if not even below because after all your breath doesn‚Äôt stink.


No all the normal rules of game still apply. You can‚Äôt just break down her confidence, at some point you have to get her to like you and build rapport with her in order to smash. However, it will be much easier, because you won‚Äôt have to compete with her ego. She‚Äôs already submitting to you. 


If you want more info on this, look into how pimps ‚Äúbreak‚Äù females. This is the process in which a guy, no matter how ugly, broke, or homeless, convinces a very attractive woman to pay him $1000 up front for the RIGHT to sell her pussy for him and give HIM all of the money. If you don‚Äôt believe me look it up. Pimps accomplish this through inflating their perceived status and destroying hers. If that‚Äôs not proof that women will do anything for status I don‚Äôt know what is",54,1

I highly recommend getting some platonic female friends.,"Hello TRP. Long time lurker here.  Have to say while I agree with a lot of stuff here, I don't agree with everything. With that in mind, I want to give you all a piece of advice that might be controversial here as I haven't seen too much about it: get one or two platonic female friends and place them in prominent positions in your life. It will benefit you immensely.

Now, I know what you're thinking: AWALT, this dude is a cuck, wtf is he on, etc. so there's a few caveats to this. First, these women have to be completely platonic. You don't want to fuck them, you've never wanted to fuck them, you're never going to fuck them. For all intents and purposes, they are as much of a sexual object to you as your sister is. Two, you have to genuinely enjoying hanging out with them. It should be  natural, genuine friendship with no phoniness or alterior motives to it.

Ok now that you've done that, what the hell is this supposed to do? What's the catch? Well gents, take a look at everything posted here and ask yourself: if I have women in my life who I don't fuck, but are very important to me, what would that instill in women I do want to fuck? That's right: the dread game to end all dread game.

See, I'm speaking from personal experience here. I have two close female friends, R and M. R's been in a long-term relationship for 7 years and M used to date a friend of mine and we started a business together. They are very important to me and we have a good friendship which fulfills a lot of my emotional needs (again, great since you're not trying to fuck them and you don't have to rely on plates for this shit. really helps you keep yourself on track). As such, they usually come up when I talk about my personal life and every single time I do on a date, it's like clockwork

The girl will cock her head and ask a bit more about them.

She'll then act a little aloof, as if to process the information that I have female friends.

And then she can't keep her hands off of me.

I can't believe how well it works and I get to have my cake and eat it too in terms of my friendship goals and my personal goals. Platonic female friends are also great in terms of giving advice on the behavior of women (but please dont ever take dating advice from them. that's still a no no). Highly recommend compartmentalizing and finding some women to do this with; it'll add a new dimension to your game.

TL;DR: Get some platonic female friends to introduce some nuclear-level spice to your dread game.",205,1

Getting One Night Stands From Dating Apps: Know the Signs,"Later this week I'll be talking to five or six girls one night on Tinder. Obviously I can't meet them all. As I've written in the past, I generally don't go on ""dates"" with these hoes, but sometimes I do when the vibe of the conversation calls for it (see my post Escalating A Tinder Match, Part 2). 

Either way, though, I want to filter for girls who are DTF the first night. Over the years I've come to recognize a few surefire signs that she's down for a one night stand. 

**She Lives Alone:** Although it's pretty unusual to find girls living alone in my city, the few who do are invariably down for same night sex. It makes sense when you think of it. Without any female roommates or family to keep her in check, she can behave like a hoe with no repercussions whatsoever. Feel free to invite yourself to her place to ""drink wine"" or ""smoke weed."" 

The one downside is that these girls usually ghost after the first date/meetup. I've never once plated a girl like this. Remember, she's living alone for a reason. On the other hand, I always plate local girls with roommates after a same night lay. Just something to keep in mind. 

**She's Traveling:** I always ascertain her location within the first few messages. If she's just visiting, then you can be sure that she's down to hookup. Get a drink and either head back to her hotel or bring her back to your place. Obviously you both know going in that it's a one night stand, so act accordingly. 

**Terse Messages:** Most guys take one word replies or short, terse messages to mean lack of interest. On the contrary, it often means that she just wants you to get to the point. Escalate quickly as I've written in my previous guides. 

**Other Tells:** Tattoos and unconventional piercings (nose, belly button, etc.) are both pretty good signs that she's down to fuck early on, as are racy pictures in her profile (bikini shots, underwear shots, etc). I've also noticed that girls who enjoy fast cars, motorcycles, and other risky activities are likely to be hoes. 

# The Numbers Game

I've come to the conclusion that most of my dating app success (and in clubs, for that matter) comes down to **being at the right place at the right time.** 

Building out a killer profile doesn't get you laid; it merely prepares you for success. To actually succeed at dating apps, you need to rack up a huge number of matches...preferably at least 100 a month...and you need to know what to do with those matches.

To be honest, most of the hottest girls that I've banged from apps (HB8s) were dumb luck. They downloaded the app, and I just happened to be one of the first guys that caught their eye. My profile/Looks got my foot in the door, and I moved rapidly to seal the deal. I'm sure that these girls matched with hotter guys than me, but having the fast finger is what got me the bang and not Chad. 

I tend to disagree with the notion that these girls go out to ""see what happens."" On some level, they know what they want. Maybe she just broke up with her boyfriend. Perhaps she's bored and lonely in a new city. Could be that she's traveling and horny to try some strange cock. Whatever the reason, don't dither. As soon as she gets what she wants from one of her matches, the opportunity is gone. **Recognize the signs and move quickly.**",75,1

* When you first start going to the gym you will give yourself excuses not to go.
* When you first start learning a new skill you will say you're not good enough.

All these doubts......

Work is not easy. Do not hope it will be easy. You will only be let down.

For many who want to improve, however lack the energy; you break the chains.

You cannot move towards the path if you are chained down by bad habits.

Break bad habits by enforcing good ones. Do not punish yourself. Only steer back to the good.

To build good habits, start slow and build momentum. Momentum is key.

It is better to start then to have never have started at all.

# Why Life lacks meaning:

it lacks meaning for you simply lack to give it one.

Many do not think for themselves. They allow others to determine the narrative of their life.

One needs to ask themselves the questions no one else does. This is how one can start to think for them self.

Life is a gift and you need to learn to make it one worth having. You have to give it value.

It does not matter what your peers or random men on the internet think.

Do what you want to do. It may not be easy, however nothing worthwhile usually is.

# The Ending is met with a beginning:

Every goal you achieve will be met with a new beginning.

Death in itself is a process with a beginning and a end.

Let the ways of old fade and start up the mountain.

There will always be mountains to climb. However, This does not mean you shouldn't climb them.

&gt;*""The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart.*  
*Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself, forms a world.""*  
\~ Albert Camus *(Myth of Sisyphus)*

# The Sacrifices of Greatness:

in order for you to achieve greatness it will take sacrifice.

One will have to either sacrifice:

* Time
* Money
* Vices
* Bad influences (whether it be friends, family or beliefs)

You get what you put in.

You have to invest in yourself.

No one else will, until you do.

***The Individual .VS. The Collective:***

Many will try to shame and belittle you.

That is their right, it is also you're right to prove them wrong.

Many people are in groups for their afraid to be alone. Most not all, *(obviously).*

You will have to go against the tide occasionally.

The best thing you can do is learn how to ride the waves.

# Accept the Pain:

Pain is going to always be there, so do not act as if it's not.

Emotionally and physically you will meet trails.

Meet them with acceptance. not contempt.

Without pain the value of successes would be absent of worth.

Pain is the cost of greatness.

***You're alone, till you're not:***

Friends will come and go.

Pussy will come and go.

You will be alone for long periods of time.

You will find yourself looking out into the outskirts of the city seeing people mindlessly walk into stores. While the sun shines among the trees and the wind sings softly to the earth.

That is fine.

The road of greatness is the road less taken.

However, not be afraid to say hello to others when passing by.

&gt;*‚ÄúThe story of life is quicker than the wink of an eye, the story of love is hello and goodbye*

# Conclusion:

The journey through hell is what molds a man into what he's going to be the rest of his life.

You did not ask to be born, however you will be asked for an answer as to why.

"No matter how much she wants you to ""open up"", she WILL use your sensitivities against you.","It's like riding a motorcycle. You're not wearing gear for IF you go down, but for for WHEN. It might not be exactly this moment, but it's coming regardless. Women will always try to feminize even the most macho of men to see how much they can bend them, but the second he bends to her will she loses respect for him and loses attraction. Even if it's ""her idea"" for you to make yourself vulnerable, she will hold it against you. Deep down, even the most redpilled men half a purple-tainted heart and want to be loved for who they really are inside, so sadly even the most vigilant man can be caught off guard. I've done it and bet you have too, where you unicorn at least one woman, and you can't help but let down those walls. No matter how amazing you think she is, she's still a woman.


We've had bad things happen to us. Maybe we were raped, molested, assaulted, etc, and we feel safe confide in our significant other. Feeling safe is different from being safe. Inside, she's turned off by this happening to you. She knows it's not your fault, but she can't help but lose fondness for you. She longs for a man who shows his emotions/feelings to her but wants to toss him out when he does. You are damned if you do and damned if you don't.

Never Put Kids First,"**Putting the Kids First is a Recipe For Disaster.  Never do it.**^1

Note:  For anyone who thinks I ‚Äúhate kids‚Äù, or I don‚Äôt want you to have kids, please read the first footnote before complaining.  Then don't complain.

So either you fell for the baby trap, or you think you found your **[Disney Girl]( https://archive.is/xlVcS)**, and you are, or are about to become a dad.

Congrats.  I hope everything goes well.  

Spoiler Alert: It probably won‚Äôt. 

There‚Äôs going to be a lot of pressure to start mouthing the mantra:  *""THE KIDS ALWAYS COME FIRST!!!""*

I have seen this 1000x.  It is the bluepill propaganda of baby-worshipping diaper-sniffers.  It's designed to be an unassailable excuse so that dad and the marriage can be put last or neglected altogether.  It is the natural evolution of the ""Woman &gt; Man"" philosophy of Toxic Feminism: Kids &gt; Woman (but not really, it‚Äôs just the lie they tell) &gt; Man.  

It also leads to overweight, stressed-out moms who also neglect themselves because, *""Hail, baby!""*  

""Putting the kids first"" leads to what the Romans called *""Deadicus Bedroomicus""* and the *""We just grew apart""* divorce.  She‚Äôs not going to want to fuck because she‚Äôs stressed out and fat, and you‚Äôre not going to want to fuck her because she‚Äôs ~~stressed out and~~ FAT.    But you had better come running when she snaps her fingers.  You will be keeping your end of the bargain (read: $$$) but that dewy, lissome, comely lass?  Everything on her is going to look ‚Äúwilted‚Äù and she‚Äôs going to be a moody bitch.  This is, incidentally, why I Nail Young Tail.  They are younger, hotter, tighter ‚Äì and therefore better ‚Äì they believe everything I tell them (no worries, I am a benevolent dictator), and they are *NEVER* ‚Äútoo tired‚Äù for fun.

Oh, and the kids who always ‚Äúcame first‚Äù?  They turn into entitled little shitheads.  It‚Äôs a problem.

How, then, to avoid this bullshit?

Well first, you can go MGTOW (‚ÄúMen Going Their Own Way‚Äù, or as I like to say ‚ÄúMen Guarding Their Own Wallets‚Äù.)  I‚Äôm agnostic on kids, and I like women, I enjoy their company, and I like keeping all my income and property when I break-up with them.  I have no problem getting women and usually have a roster of 4-6.  

In my view, marriage is a sucker‚Äôs bet: 53% end in divorce and of the 47% that don‚Äôt, how many are happy?  How many are ‚Äúmostly ok‚Äù?  How many are medium sucky to awful?  Loads.  Lots of guys wind up getting married to their One Special Girl only to wind up paying their demonic ex-wife up to 40% of their gross to bang other guys and teach their kids to hate him.  No, thanks.

I may change my mind, but it‚Äôs just not likely.  If I said to you, *‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs go skydiving tomorrow, and don‚Äôt worry, nearly half of the parachutes open.‚Äù*^2  Would you go?  No, you would tell me *‚ÄúFuck you!  Good luck with that shit, crazy guy!‚Äù*

And you‚Äôd be right.  

**So What If You Get Married Anyway?**

If you do get married, cohabitate in an LTR you need to understand that:

(a) You never stop gaming her.  **[You Never Stop Competing](http://archive.is/9LNHf)**

(b) Don‚Äôt be one of those moron betas who thinks he‚Äôs ‚Äúwon‚Äù and let‚Äôs himself go, gets fat, self-medicates with SportsBall and beer and never sees the divorce-rape coming.  

If you do want a family, you need to **[Become the Prize](http://archive.is/ZM7zX)**.  And just being a good provider isn‚Äôt enough.  I had cocktails with two married guys yesterday. One complained about how he has to ""hide"" money from his wife.  During quarantine, she basically averages a box from Amazon every day; he bought something online and she was all up in his face about spending money.  He has his own business so he takes out $1500-2000 a month that she ""doesn't know about,"" so he can have some $ to do what he wants with.

**Think that over.  This is a millionaire businessman who has to *hide* money from his wife so he can spend a couple of grand each month without getting bitched at.**

The other guy and his wife seem to get along pretty wll, but he kvetches all the time, too.  He used to be a baller, but now he‚Äôs in his 50s, and he‚Äôs only ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to bang his 50 y.o. wife‚Äôs 50 y.o. pussy.  

This reminds me of the punchline of an old joke.  

Q: *‚ÄúWhy do husbands die before their wives?‚Äù*

A:  *‚ÄúThey want to.‚Äù*  

Of the three of us, guess who gets to do whatever he wants, hassle-free?  I bet you can name that tune in One Note.

So, how to pull it off?

**You Need To Be The Paterfamilias**

You need to PATRIARCHY THE FUCK out of your situation: The husband/father should be at the center of the family, around whom the wife and children revolve and upon whom he shines like the sun, and brings warmth and sustenance.  There is a reason it's called ""Head of Household"", and not ""Neglected serf who toils thanklessly, gets once-a-month pity sex from his land whale wife and then is divorced-raped.""

Your frame need to be way stronger than her frame.  You also need to settle on traditional sex roles early on ‚Äì wait, don‚Äôt want to be the full-time provider?  **But that‚Äôs what you signed up for, Mac.**  You can look forward to working 400 more hours (10x40 hour weeks or 2,5 months) than your single counterparts.^3  

It‚Äôs not going to be easy.  You can forget about getting a ‚ÄúSlavic Unicorn‚Äù from the East or an ‚ÄúAsian Unicorn‚Äù from the Far East.  You can try it, but you‚Äôre just going to have a different set of problems.  

For guys who are iffy about marriage but want to have kids, here is Blackdragon‚Äôs (who I am not, but who I read from time to time) had a guide for this very thing: [The 12 Steps To Safely Have Kids With A Woman](https://blackdragonblog.com/2016/07/28/the-12-steps-have-kids/).  I am skeptical as fuck about it, but it‚Äôs a piece of information for guys who want kids.

So I wish you luck if you want to walk that pat, Mac.  You‚Äôre going to need it.

================================

^1 Note:  Lots of TRP Oreos^TM ‚Äì red on the outside, blue on the inside ‚Äì come at me over ‚Äúhating kids‚Äù.  I am not anti-kid.  I am particularly fond of other people‚Äôs 22 year old daughters.  Go have 100 kids.   It‚Äôs up to you.  But you have to understand that not every kid turns out.

What situation in your life forced you to take the red pill?,"Just interested in some people‚Äôs stories. I‚Äôm gonna give mine you can read if you‚Äôd like. 

     So 2 1/2 years ago I met my ex. We were both 17 and seniors in high school. She was so authentic, innocent, and just a straight up beauty. We had an ABSOLUTELY amazing first year and a half of our relationship. But then things slowly started to change. She started hanging around her one friend a lot more. Shit just went downhill from there. She started acting weird, less nice and innocent, and more like a feminist. Months later I found out she was fucking around with this dude she worked with and I was absolutely heartbroken, I never thought she would do that to me. I think she really just realized the power she had after that and tried dangling it over my head. For a few months I complied but then I slowly started getting introduced to the red pill. And god damn, it explained everything. I finally would not put up with her shit anymore and we absolutely hate each other now. She tried making me out to be abusive to her yet I never layed a finger on her or got even close. The closest thing to ‚Äúabuse‚Äù was us getting in an argument and me being pissed but I never lost control I never got violent with anyone or anything. And I‚Äôm still fucked up from that relationship because I really did love her. I got into another rebound relationship shortly after her and it didn‚Äôt last very long but those two situations got me fucked mentally. Both drop dead beautiful women. I like don‚Äôt even wanna deal with chicks and relationships right now I have to focus on myself for my own mental health.... what‚Äôs your story? And feel free to share thoughts on mine.",87,1
The Baby Trap,"**The Baby Trap**		

So let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve been dating your girlfriend or plating plates for a while, but then the ladies in question get to 26 or so.   

You may notice the onset of ‚ÄúBaby Rabies‚Äù.  If she starts talking about babies, asking  *‚ÄúWhat if I got pregnant?‚Äù*, and ogling babies that she sees in strollers in public etc., she is having Baby Rabies.  

What is the Baby Trap?

If your LTR/plate asks about whether you want to be a husband and a dad or not, you are entering the Danger Zone.  Your answer is, *‚ÄúOf course, I want to be a husband and a dad, babe.  I want to Fill You Up with babies.‚Äù*

Why?  

Because Baby Rabies takes no prisoners.  It prevents them from thinking rationally.  So why tell her that you are totally down to preg her up?  Because if she feels you pulling away, she‚Äôs going to pull the goalie ‚Äì otherwise she‚Äôd have to find a guy like you, who fucks as good as you, who has as good a job as you, and she will need time to vet him and make sure he‚Äôs not a loser and that will take *TIME* and her womb wants a baby *RIGHT FUCKING NOW!* 

So when she start showing these signs, you can either dump her or you can start finishing in her mouth and telling her to swallow because *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so SEXY when you do that.‚Äù*  All the better not to receive unexpected Fathers Day cards.  Dumping your load in her vag is even more dangerous than usual, once Baby Rabies has kicked in.

And it can happen to anyone ‚Äì good girls, sluts, girls who *swore* they never wanted kids‚Ä¶anyone.

So be careful, or it won‚Äôt just be her calling you *‚ÄúDADDY!‚Äù*",209,1
Social conditioning from your childhood will determine whether you will have beta qualities alpha qualities,"Let‚Äôs look at multiple examples here

A) the mommas boy. The mommas boy is the guy that has been accustomed to having a good relationship with his mom and does everything he can to make sure his decisions make his mother happy. This behaviour will‚Äîas you guessed it‚Äîunconsciously transfer to how he behaves in the dating world. He‚Äôll be labeled a simp because he‚Äôll always try and do whatever he can to make the girl happy just like he does with his mother‚Äîeven at his own expense. If this sounds like you don‚Äôt worry, just recognize it and understand that your social conditions have caused this. Cognitive behavioural therapy should help as well. 


B) emotionally abusive parents 

This child will learn to be accustomed to abuse and be okay with it. Until this child turns 18 he‚Äôll assume that tolerating emotional abuse from other people is normal. Until this example turns 18 and moves out from his socially conditioned home, unlearning those social conditions will become very difficult. 

C) the asshole father 

The kid with the asshole father will learn that the only love he receives from his dad is mean, and abusiveness. He‚Äôll them in retrospect give show affection by being mean and abusive. This example will turn into something called the toxic alpha. The one with Alpha qualities but it‚Äôs so toxic that no girl will tolerate you in the end‚Äîunless she herself comes from this kind of home. This guy will mostly attract women from abusive homes and daddy issues because emotional abuse is all they know. If you find yourself seeing some similarities, I am currently in this boat and cognitive behavioural therapy has helped tons. The goal is to help recognize your triggers and understand how to behave in an effective manor.",89,1

Reminder - Desire Can't Be Negotiated,"Just a reminder of red pill fundamentals one of the being that the desire can't be negotiated and you should commit (if you choose to) to a girl only if she really wants you. You want to be her first choice. Otherwise you end up bitching how you got cheated.

So here's a quick story which underlined couple fundamental things and made me to write this post.

It was thursday night and my ex-LTR candidate, which I dropped from rotation few weeks ago because of too much drama, called me while being a bit drunk. She is a student and usually student parties are and thursdays where I live. Anyway, it was the usual stuff, she begged me that she could come over etc. This all happened while her class mate (around ~22 year old boy) who is really into her was hanging around at the background and listening her the phone call with me.

Obviously I didn't want her to come because she was drunk and I had work next day so I keep saying no to her while she kept insisting - she had tried all her usual tricks (shaming, begging, being extremely nice, being extremely angry) in 1 or 2 minutes until she threw a new twist in knowing I'm a greedy motherfucker when it comes to money. She promised to pay me 40 euros if she could come over and suck my dick and ""I didn't need to do anything"" and ""She would do all the work"".

Now there is another twist as well, she is seeing some other dude who has already after ~3-4weeks promised her that he won't fuck other girls anymore. I guess she has bitched about me fucking other girls and the dude tried to ""impress"" her by saying that he won't fuck other girls anymore. The funny part here is that my ex-LTR candidate said after his promise to him that ""That's nice, but I may fuck other guys"". Imagine, she says this to the same guy who she says is so sweet and nice and treats her well while she bitches how I make her feel like human trash.

Lessons being: 
- Don't be any of the other guys in story. 
- Girls this BPD and crazy shouldn't be LTR'd. They can behave even up to 3 months and then the drama ensues.
- Desire can't be negotiated and you should be her first choice (altho, this is difficult to confirm sometimes)
- When the girl has burning desire for you, she will do anything.
- Also realize that she is kind of an extreme case, so this is not usual stuff especially if you are good at screening/vetting.

Also my personal thought regarding her - I honestly feel pity for her. There is plenty of small minded men who would abuse her in similar situation. I could have made her to get a cab, bring me something to eat, take her money, nut on her face and kick her out and there is plenty if bitter guys who would have done that and probably boast about it in internet - All I'm saying that you can get results without being a douchebag but while being a man of integrity. (oh yes and save the ""sexual strategy is amoral""-comments. I play the game my own way.)

*tl;dr*

- Ex-LTR candicate calls me drunk and promises to pay me that she can suck my dick
- Her classmate who has a crush on her, listens the phone call on the background
- She is seeing another dude who has already promised her one-directional monogamy while she still keeps calling me begging for sex and attention",5,1

Recommend me a book on on 'composure' and on healthy egocentrism," *Please allow me this wall text to present my idea...*

Imagine I just find out about something incredibly good, yet it would take me quite some time to mater that subject. Carried by enthusiasm, I try to go tell others, but they did not know what I know and read, and I cannot tell them what i read and saw in many hours, to tell them in a 20 seconds time.

i do notice however when i talk about a subject i know very good, i am more relaxed, talk with composure and even if the listener starts to play around or act silly, i don't mind at all...

perhaps i need another book.. something about healthy egocentrism... why do i feel this desire to share and tell everyone about this and that, when I don't even master it myself that subject. it could even be a movie or a self help lecture, i just feel it could help the other person so i feel i want to tell them but i know nobody really has time for that, and so i waste my time... i wish i was more egocentric in the positive way.. 

perhaps a book on this subject would illuminate me to invest more into myself so that i can help others later on, instead of trying to feed this impulse... i want to stop sharing and just learn it for myself, and have elegant calm composure when i speak..

thank you in advance. i will read your book !

Why you can‚Äôt get any girl you want if your in school(you might have already turned her off),"Yes I said it. YOU CANT GET ANY GIRL YOU WANT. Now the reason for this is interest but let‚Äôs talk about my backstory as a guy who discovered the red pill and why you shouldn‚Äôt even bother doing what I did if your anything like me. I started getting into the red pill about 2 months ago when I started going back to school perfect you would think I had a whole school FILLED with pussy for my choosing. WRONG you see I‚Äôve been with the same kids for 7+ years and they viewed me as the introverted weird kid I‚Äôve done so much fucked up shit that I‚Äôve basically tarnished my reputation at the school. Eventually I made a complete 180 now an extroverted man with what I thought was a clean slate I choose 3 girls to start a rotation with. I‚Äôll tell ya how that went 1 rejection 1 gets a boyfriend 1 doesn‚Äôt like me at all. Now what do all of these females have in common you might ask, THEY DONT HAVE INTEREST IN ME. If a female isn‚Äôt interested in you then you won‚Äôt be able to do anything with her shit if you were like me she wouldn‚Äôt want to be caught talking to you.The issue with dating in school is the fact that they know too much about you and your past. If you did something like how I did they will still view you as a loser no matter how much you‚Äôve changed. And the second issue is that no matter how much you try there is nothing you can do that will guarantee to make her pay attention to you and have interest. You can do things to make her interested but if she views you as a beta and their isn‚Äôt any form of mystery  you can‚Äôt do shit. THERE IS GOOD NEWS. If your like me you need to do strictly cold approaches because no females you cold approach will ever know about your past or you in general unless you tell them which makes things a lot easier if you have a bad past. You can go on YouTube and watch other men cold approach females and just copy what they do. So I‚Äôll save you a shit ton of pain and leave those ugly hoes at school alone and pursue girls that you randomly meet in public",25,1
"Shit Tests, Game, and Having a Fucking Backbone","In a previous post, a commenter mentioned the concept of ‚Äúshit tests‚Äù and winning a girl over. He‚Äôs of the opinion you should be working to win over girls who are on the fence about having sex with you ‚Äì including girls who ‚Äúshit test‚Äù you.

A shit test is an insult/combative question/disruptive question a girl throws at you when she‚Äôs not really that interested in you, or is just a rude/socially-retarded person in general. She‚Äôs throwing up a hurdle and making things difficult for you.

Googling ‚Äúshit test‚Äù brings up a host of articles ‚Äì it‚Äôs a very common concept in the pickup artist/getting with girls world. All the articles you‚Äôll read about shit tests say they‚Äôre a completely ‚Äúnormal‚Äù part of dating/having sex, as if you should expect to be insulted every time you want to have sex with a girl. Some articles go as far as to say *every* girl will shit test you, and ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not getting shit tested, you‚Äôre doing something wrong.‚Äù Examples: 

*‚ÄúI bet you have a small dick.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm not giving you my number.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDo you just walk around hitting on girls all day?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYou have man boobs‚Äù.*

*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt date Asian guys.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bald, that‚Äôs so gross.‚Äù*

There‚Äôs several issues going on here. First of all, any girl that‚Äôs mean to you or insults you is someone you should run away from (assuming you haven‚Äôt said anything insulting to her first). You should NOT be sticking around and trying to ‚Äúwin over‚Äù a girl who‚Äôs mean to somebody she just met.

Second issue is all these articles talk about ‚Äúpassing‚Äù a shit test, as if you should be jumping through hoops like a little puppy dog. It‚Äôs an extremely unhealthy mindset to think you need to ‚Äúplease‚Äù girls and ‚Äúwin them over‚Äù ‚Äì sex/dating isn‚Äôt a fucking test or quiz you‚Äôre trying to pass. Sex is two people deciding they‚Äôre into each other, and then going into the bedroom and touching each other‚Äôs naughty bits. **It‚Äôs not a fucking power struggle.**

Third, if you‚Äôre getting insulted/shit tested by girls (and it‚Äôs happening more than just 1 in every 100 girls), you‚Äôre doing something really wrong ‚Äì or your appearance/sex appeal is really horrific. If you‚Äôre a fat, balding, badly-dressed short guy telling girls they‚Äôre cute, you‚Äôre naturally going to get a few insults/disgusted looks from girls. If that‚Äôs the case, fix that immediately, and *then* talk to girls. The *vast* majority of girls are really fucking nice people ‚Äì they don‚Äôt insult random strangers for no reason.

Finally, any guy who gets laid a lot knows shit tests aren‚Äôt actually that common in the real world, and you can chalk up any shit test to ‚Äúthis girl is weird‚Äù and just go find another girl to hit on.

A lot of these articles say the point is you should aim to get to a point where shit tests don‚Äôt affect you, and you literally don‚Äôt care when a girl insults you. So you‚Äôre hoping to feel *neutral* when a girl insults you. That‚Äôs the *best case scenario*. But shouldn‚Äôt you be aiming to feel *good* when you talk to girls? Don‚Äôt you want to spend time with or have a conversation with a girl who makes you feel *good*, not *neutral*?

# An Insult Isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúOn The Fence‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs a NO

If a girl insults you/mocks you in a serious way, she‚Äôs not on the fence. She just INSULTED YOU. That‚Äôs a no, not a maybe. She‚Äôs very overtly telling you she‚Äôs not interested in sleeping with you. If you keep trying to have sex with her, you‚Äôre telling yourself you have no self-respect. Have a damn backbone; why are you trying to win over a girl who already turned you down?

Any girl who insults you when you did nothing to provoke her, *has mental problems*. Emotionally-stable people don‚Äôt insult strangers.

The world is full of women ‚Äì over 4 billion of them. If a girl insults you, move on and go find another one. There‚Äôs so many ‚Äúyes girls‚Äù out there who‚Äôll be enthusiastic and not require you to ‚Äúwork on them‚Äù or ‚Äúwin them over‚Äù. You‚Äôll save yourself a lot of hassle if you ignore the *maybe* girls and spend your time finding the *yes* girls. It‚Äôs a better, more efficient use of your time. **In the time you waste trying to overcome one girl‚Äôs shit tests, you could have hit on 10 more girls.**

# Game = Being Fake

When you‚Äôre playing games and handling shit tests, when you actually do have sex with the girl there‚Äôs always a small part of you that thinks, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs only having sex with me because I‚Äôm putting up a front and acting all confident and cocky and tough. If she knew the real me ‚Äì the actual me ‚Äì she‚Äôd leave me.‚Äù

When you actually decide to [be real with girls and treat them like they‚Äôre on the same team](https://killyourinnerloser.com/you-and-me/) (instead of being combative), and then have sex with a girl, you absolutely *know* she‚Äôs into *you*, and not just the mask you‚Äôre hiding behind.

Guys who advocate for playing games and winning girls over and having pre-rehearsed lines in your head are avoiding true vulnerability and openness. They‚Äôre avoiding being real, because they‚Äôre secretly terrified girls won‚Äôt like the real them underneath the mask. It‚Äôs cowardly to play games &amp; put up a front; life is easier if you just drop the bullshit and be real.

**So here‚Äôs my challenge to you.** Go out and be real with the next 10 girls you try to have sex with. Try being normal, instead of trying to pass shit tests, ‚Äúrun game on her‚Äù, etc. Walk away from the insults, walk away from the girls who are on the fence, and go talk to girls who make you feel good. Be open with those girls, tell them if you‚Äôre feeling insecure, show them it‚Äôs completely cool to be open and vulnerable. Show her you‚Äôre on the same team.

After my [You and Me](https://killyourinnerloser.com/you-and-me/) article, a tonne of guys emailed to say they‚Äôd tried being real with girls and had massive success with it. So if you try being real, drop a comment below and share your story.

Don't Get Mad She Cheated,"There are plenty of reasons why being cheated on shouldn't anger you. The most important of these reasons being that a woman should never have power over your emotional control.

One foundational aspect of frame is that no external circumstances should affect your internal valuation of yourself. In other words, you are not in control of what happens to you, but you are in control of how you respond to it -- you are in control of a situation because it happens within your frame of interpretation and response. Even when cheated on, you are still in control because you have the almighty power of walking away and moving on.

My favorite example of this is the Dirty Sheets story, which you can find on the top all time posts or using the search bar for TheRedPill.

Another reason why being cheated on shouldn't anger you is because you now have an opportunity to reflect and evaluate yourself. 

Maybe you didn't see the warning signs. Maybe you saw the red flags and chose to ignore them. Maybe she places herself in situations that could lead to cheating on you and you didnt put her in check. Maybe you adopted an alpha persona long enough to attract women, found one you really liked, then skipped back into beta la-la land with rainbows and lepricons. Maybe shes an experienced con-artsist who puts on the loyal devoted dream girl charade and you fell for it. Maybe you did mostly everything right and she was just a sexually irresponsible BPD sleeper agent who sucks dick at the slightest sign of positive attention.

Whatever the case for being cheated on is, use this as an opportunity to not repeat your mistake.

My personal favorite reason why you shouldn't let cheating draw an emotional response from you is because that's not only what a woman expects, but its what she wants.

She wants you to fly into a rage and throw glass at the wall. She wants to watch your shattered hearted self scream in emotional agony at her. She wants to cry and play the victim, then coax you into working things out and trying again with her, since this time it will be different. And when she cheats again she wants it to ruin and destroy you. She wants all of these reactions because it validates the power and control her sex has over you.

Fuck. That. Shit.

If her cheating on you doesnt illicit an emotional response, you've shown her and yourself that her sex cannot control you.

When I was 14 I got cheated on and played the raging fool. Then I matured and learned better. Years later, I was cheated on again. When I found out there was no goodbyes, no breakup speech, just black nothingness. As she called and texted me, i ignored her until she gave up. 3 months later I receive a bizarre text: ""can we at least still have sex?""

""Who is this?"" I texted back.

She called me and yelled about deleting her number, forgetting about her, then I just laughed and said ""damn I'm sorry about your situation but you have the wrong number my friend.""

She mumbled my name as I hung up.

A woman that cheats on you doesn't exist anymore. The first rule of war is to dehumanize your adversary, and a cheating woman has proven herself to be an enemy of you and your interests.

The simplest reason why you shouldn't care about being cheated on is because this world doesn't make any fucking sense.

There are blue pilled beta nobodies who don't get cheated on. There are red pill alpha celebrites who get cheated on (and I'm not talking about will Smith here.) Just laugh at this absurdity of life as you should with the rest. If I ever get cheated on in the future I will probably just start laughing and say ""whoopsie"" as I block her.

My final reason why you shouldn't let being cheated on ruin your day is because women don't even see sex in the same light as us men.

You might have heard this before, *""why are you breaking up with me, all we did was have sex, its not like it meant anything!!""*

That is the opening stanza to the cheaters national anthem, and is a glimmering diamond in the rough of a woman's psyche that explains how they view sex.

If a woman is not influenced by tradition, or worse, instead influenced by degenerate society, like most modern women if not all western women, then she will see sex as a pass time activity, a fleeting pleasure meant to be partaken in, to quench a lust desire or instinct, then forgotten about, until the next urge proves itself irresistible.

Women say ""it was only just sex"" because that's what works on them. Women have a habit of trying to use our own sexual strategies against us because in their solipsism they think what works on them works on everybody. Women get mad when men emotionally cheat. If you're alpha you can bang as many girls as you want as long as your main girl knows shes special above the rest.

So it was only just sex could imply it wasn't you who was unattractive, but rather he was attractive too. She saw an opportunity and took it. Women let the emotions and feelings of the moment override any semblance of logic they have, then they accidentally sit on someone else's dick, and forget about it even happening, only choosing to rationalize their decision if they get caught.

Women say it was only sex because sex doesn't mean anything to them, or at least what it means to us men. Women have all these mysterious criterion for what constitutes sex and cheating. For example she didn't cheat on you because she only sucked his cock or did anal with him while you are the only one to get her vagina. Getting gangbanged only counts as one notch rather than 17. Et cetera. Knowing womens twisted interpretation of why they can justify cheating with ""it was only sex"" shouldnt make you angry. It should make you laugh.

Now you know all about why you shouldn't let getting cheated on ruin your life.

When your helpless friend gets cheated on for the umpteenth time, and calls you with depression on his mind, a gun to his temple, and vodka on his breath, be a light shinning in his darkness and pass along just one of these lessons to him. 

Forever blessed.

Men have completely ruined women. We need to fix the problem at it's root.,"From here on out I won't refer to them as ""men"" because they're far from it. To simplify, I'll just refer to them as ""simps"". 


I'm only 27, so I have no personal experience with 50's style relationships or how women were. I assume many traits were the same, but there was a key difference. At one point, women were actually dateable and worth marrying. They were held to a higher standard and there weren't nearly as many men running around validating them at every turn. Simps have existed since the Garden of Eden, but in the last few decades it's just gotten worse.


The sexual revolution and birth of the internet (and pornographers) have inflated the female ego to unimagineable levels. Women 5 and below run rampant acting like they're 9's &amp; 10's, but you can't blame them for this. After all, who gave them the validation? Look at any woman of any level of attractiveness on Instagram, Reddit, etc and check out who's following her and reacting to her content. Who are the comments from? Simps. Every single time without fail. Normal men who respect themselves don't look at or support their content. Normal men don't subscribe to Onlyfans or tip streamers. If he stands by his convictions he won't even look at porn.


The real men they crave after want nothing to do with them, so they are angry at these men, but also respect them for not giving in. The simps who shower them with validation, date them, hold the camera for their Onlyfans; these women don't have an ounce of respect for them because they don't respect themselves. They will say they want to date the blue-pilled simps in some vain effort to not look shallow, but they won't really. The simps are convinced that if they validate them enough they'll get pussy, and some do. Just because she gives him a little something doesn't mean she respects him. The first real man that comes along will instantly spark her interest and the flame under her belly. She will respect him far more than the weak goobers that have been pining after her for years.


I can guarantee you that women would fix their act mighty fast if all men stopped simping for them. I know it will never happen, but I'd give it less than a month. Women would start taking care of themselves and strive to improve so that regular quality men will want them. Closer to how things apparently were.

"""Run, you fool!"" Ramifications of a BPD user.","You don't see many posts about BPD women archived in TRP. It's quite sad because we spew knowledge on what to look for in women and how to get the best out of the sexual market place. Yet, many aren't prepared when they cross paths with a BPD woman. When they finally realize what bomb they just stepped on, it's pretty much too late.

I do not claim to be an expert in this field of psychology. I can only relay my experiences and the research I underwent.

This will be a pretty hefty post, so sit tight, and I will give you the gist of my experience with such a person.


*Honeymoon Phase*

About a week ago, I made a post about an FWB. I was plating her for about 4 months. I was doing an experiment into the psyche of women and their natures. We were each other's confidants.

In the beginning, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. She was perfect, personality-wise, HB7 on average, crazy great sex, and submissive. I was living the dream and we both had plates, so there was no inkling of jealousy. At least on my end.

Don't take all of these green flags for success. In fact, these were actually red flags. BPD women use a subtle manipulation tactic called isopraxism (mirroring) to become congruent with their mates. I drank the kool-aid for a bit.

This woman had no identity. When asked about hobbies and life goals?

""Meh, I just work, watch tv, and get high.""

Another red flag was pushing for commitment almost instantly. Kids, marriage, the works. I just passively deflected such advances and continued what we had. She stopped pressing and eventually we became FWBs.


*Confidants*

This is the most important section of this post. I got to peer into her psyche with the shit she revealed to me. When she wasn't afraid to hide who she was anymore, it was like looking at Satan's daughter.

I visited her at her apartment one day, and we just chilled and drank beers. She wanted to show me something. I saw her Tinder matches. (Another manipulation tactic) There was about 200 of them. She showed me messages. Guys were begging and pleading for her attention and pussy.

Her supply for validation was limitless. The entitlement was disgusting. Don't be mistaken though. This particular girl didn't have standards. Hypergamy didn't seem to apply to her. She fucked anything with a penis. She didn't care about how much status or money a guy had. Just her ability to control them and rip their hearts out. Femme Fatale.

It was all a sick game to her. She told me that she wants to marry this simp that she's dating and when she gets the ring, she's gonna divorce him. Then, it's on to the next victim.


*Exit Strategy*

This all happened in a span of a month. It's also around the time I made two posts on asktrp. I was given a lot of advice to fucking bail because I was going to be next on the chopping block.

The guys in this community told me the condition she had. I researched it, and it rang every bell.

I couldn't leave without helping this guy out though. My conscience was bothering me.

I knew his name and address because she wouldn't shut the fuck up about him. I created a fake facebook page and messaged him. I let him know what type of woman he was dealing with. I let him know that she wasn't as monogamous as he was led to believe.

What the fuck does this simp do? You guessed it. He became a white knight. He showed my FWB the messages, (Bad idea) and she manipulated him to believe it was his fault. She made this dude question his own reality when faced with overwhelming evidence.

She confronted me too, but I was able to convince her that it was one of her other beta slaves. Dude was in too deep and there was no saving him.

I was sickly impressed with the level of mastery my FWB had in regards to manipulation. A part of me wanted to fuck her brains out, the other was to shoot her in the fucking dome. I had to leave.


*Leaving*

So, I made a plan to make her believe I was jealous of this guy. All women love and hate jealousy. I wanted her to see me as an expendable beta.

I made a big deal about her flaking on me. She tried to gaslight me. She was entirely at fault, but she was the one who was angry. Completely helpless to accountability. She ghosted me, and I was free from such filth. I couldn't believe it was that simple.

I took that advice from a guy on my post about the FWB.


*Conclusion*

I will admit, this bond with her was quite intoxicating. It was a fucking thrill! Her mood-swings and random urges to do daredevilish shit was amusing, but she was toxic in every sense of the word. The shit-tests were abmormal and confusing. I'd explain it, but this post is huge enough anyway. Ask me in the comments. 0/10 never again.

Overcoming LMR Step-by-Step With a Hot Hinge Date (and More),"Quick field report here. Had a fun/interesting date last week that I'd like to share.

# Initial Contact

Last week I matched with a girl on Hinge, 23 YO cute blonde HB8 former sorority type with a nice athletic body.

We matched around 8 PM and messaged over the course of a few hours. By the fourth message we were talking about meeting, and I snagged her number before going to bed, telling her that I'd hit her up soon.

I texted her the next day (Thursday) for logistics only and scheduled a date for Saturday night at 7:30. Like I've written in previous posts, make the date no more than 72 hours out. On Saturday afternoon, I pinged her with ""Hey, I'm still down to meet tonight."" Maybe that seems needy to some of you, but if she's gonna flake I wanna know so I can make other plans. She confirmed that she was still down though, so I let her know that I'd text her when I head out (important - I suspect many girls don't even leave their homes until you confirm that you're en route).

# Date

I live in a major city where nightlife is more or less nonexistent due to Covid. The few outdoor bars require advance reservations. It's a huge pain in the ass.

Instead I took this opportunity to experiment with a new idea. Rather than going for the typical drink at a bar, I met her at a waterfront park. Brought a blanket and some wine. She seemed to really like the idea when I first proposed it. It was a good vibe - lots of college kids in the city were down there drinking as well. Kino was a breeze because we were sitting so close together on the blanket. She was all over me right away. 

After an hour or whatever it was, I really needed to take a piss...and I mean badly. This not being a bar, of course there were no toilets around, and eventually it got to the point where I just couldn't hold it (pro-tip: don't drink a ton of water + have a cup of coffee before doing a date like this). I told her something like ""hey, hate to cut things short, but I *really* need to go to the bathroom."" I couldn't even think about escalating or anything at this stage - all I could think about was how I was going to relieve myself.

Fortunately she made things easy for me and offered to let me use the bathroom at her place, as she lived close by. 

# Escalation

After taking a nice long piss, we're in her room talking. Obviously I assume at this point that we're going to bang - she said she was nervous because I'm ""hot as fuck"" - and we quickly start making out. She's an excellent kisser and things are getting pretty heated. But when I go to take off her clothes, I get hit with the usual BS (translation in italics):

""I never have sex on the first date"" *I have sex on the first date with the right guy.*

""This is my one rule."" *I only have rules for Betas.*

""I don't want to be a one night stand"" *I'm open to having a one night stand.*

*""*I'm not going to have sex with you tonight."" *I'm going to have sex with you if you can pass my shit test*

I act like I don't even hear any of this nonsense. I just say something like ""yeah?"" in a somewhat disinterested, slightly amused tone...because I know how this is going to end. Her mouth is saying one thing, but her body language indicates that she's desperate for my cock. I pull back a bit and tease her until *she* leans in to kiss me again. At one point, I go to finger her...she's wet as hell. After a minute, I stop abruptly and go back to making out. Then I take her hand and put it on my bulge, which she rubs through my pants.

This cat-and-mouse, push-pill game continues for a bit longer until I pull her hair back while we kiss, which makes her moan. 

""Oh you like that, don't you?""

""Yeah, I like domination."" 

""So what do you think of this?"" I say, putting my hand firmly around her throat. 

""I like it."" 

""I bet you do.""

Now it's time to go in for the kill. We kiss some more, then I take her by the throat and shove her down into the bed. She goes wild when I pin her arms above her head and kiss/bite her neck, grinding her pussy up on me. This time there's no resistance when I rip her pants off...""yes sir,"" she says, when I tell her to put the condom on my cock...but I still make sure to tease her before I put it in. 

""Tell me you want this cock""

""Oh Daddy, please give it to me, I need it...""

# Takeaways

**Hot Girls Are Easier:** Some of you may read this and think I didn't do much work, and I would agree. I don't feel like I really needed much Game to fuck this girl.  HB7-8s truly aren't any more difficult to fuck than a 5. Indeed, in my experience, they're usually easier...perhaps because they don't have problems finding replacements. 

The idea that hot chicks are somehow inaccessible to all but the Chadest of Chads is simply untrue. Your perception of the barrier to entry is much higher than reality. It's all in your head. 

**Hinge Is No Different:** I checked out the Hinge sub to see how many other guys were getting SNLs from the app. The bloopers over there are waiting weeks or even months for sex. Hinge might brand itself as a ""relationship"" app, but hypergamy doesn't care about that. 

**Don't Be Boring:** Covid forced me to think outside of the box. While every other guy is still trying to make the ""drink at a bar"" thing work, I went for something a little different. 

**If Girls Want to Fuck, They'll Fuck:** Again, this girl made it pretty obvious that she wanted me. She responded promptly to all of my messages prior to meeting up. She quickly initiated kino while on the date. When I presented a logistical problem (needing to piss), she jumped in and helped me out. 

If it feels like getting her to meet/bang is like pulling teeth, then she isn't that interested. A girl who wants to fuck will make it easy, it's really that simple. 

**LMR/ASD:** There are two types of LMR/ASD. The first is where she actually wants/plans to have sex, but she just needs to put up some token resistance so she doesn't feel ""easy."" Clearly this was a textbook example of that. She invited me back herself, for God's sake. We both knew where this was going. At no point did her body language indicate discomfort. 

When a girl genuinely isn't comfortable, you'll know from her body language. Her tone of voice will turn cold and businesslike instead of remaining playful and flirtatious. In those cases, I simply terminate the interaction. Ain't nobody got time for that nonsense. 

As long as she's still playful and open, keep going. I see a lot of guys on askTRP who take the ol' ""let's wait till the second date"" at face value...and are surprised when the second date never happens. Strike while the iron is hot. Don't snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. 

# Aftermath

I did make one mistake, and that wasn't bringing enough condoms. I only had the one in my wallet, and I forgot to take more. After all the LMR/buildup, coupled with the fact that my last few lays were pretty lackluster, I ended up blowing my load very quickly. Because of my condom faux pas I couldn't go Round 2 (although she did suck me off and swallow my nut twice). Pipe Game wasn't on point, I'll admit it, and that may have hurt my chances of a second hookup. 

I sent my usual ""Last night was fun, let's do it again"" protective text the next morning, and she said she would be free later the next week to meet again. 

Well, I texted her yesterday afternoon, and now it's been 24 hours of radio silence. Maybe she gets back to me later. Maybe never. This goes back to my point about striking while the iron is hot. Don't assume there will be a second date, because oftentimes, there isn't one. This is especially true with young girls on dating apps. 

No matter what happens, at least now I have the memory of a fun night with a hot girl, rather than the disappointment of blue balls and jerking off into a tissue at home.",27,1
"You may feel you're safe opening up, she may be telling other dudes what a bitch you are.",[removed],0,1
"Older women are still women. Her age won't make her more ""mature"".","It's a common ""fact"" that women mature faster than men, but the definition of the word is vague at best when applied to them. When a boy matures into a man, he gets better. When a girl matures into a woman she gets arguably worse. Older women are still women.


I use to be one of them, but many men will say older women are far better to date. Let's be real, if she's older and has no kids then there's already something wrong with her, and if she has kids then that means she's a single mother and you don't want to date that anyway. She's past the wall at this point and it just goes downhill, so she might be a hot milf for a few years at best, and cougars can't be trusted. I don't care if her kids are over 18, as soon as you're no longer a ""hot young buck"" she'll be over you for the next Archie Andrews type. Men age like a fine wine, but she's already sour milk at that age. I'm not saying they can't be fun to pump-and-dump, but you'll never want to date one.


My most recent example is in my personal life and woke me up even more to this. My aunt always displayed herself as a smart educated family woman, and someone I spent my life looking up to and respecting. She was a teacher and had even been principal at a few schools and was loved by all. She took in her mother (my Nana) into a granny sweet on the side of their home and it was the last place we had family gatherings. I was a fool to think her female nature could have hidden itself. Around a year ago she began to cheat on her hard working husband, and it wasn't necessarily with better men. The people she ran around with were gross low-life's with nothing to offer but a different and greasier dick. She didn't even trade up. So of course the marriage ended when he found out, and she was making so many shitty decisions that she got blackballed from ever working in her field again, and lied to me that she ""got her own townhouse and things were great"". She was couch surfing with random dudes and living out of her car. My aunt clearly needed mental help and/or to be medicated but she refused completely and said she's ""finally happy"" doing all of this. Proud even. Now she's living with some gross hopped up weed-dealer the next city over with nothing to her name. Because of the divorce they could no longer afford the nice house anymore and she forced her own mother to the streets to find low-income housing and will make the rest of her years completely miserable. She even guilted my Nana into ""loaning"" her $6000 for a ""down payment on a new place"" when there was no new place and she just took the money and ran. My uncle has been far happier and is super close with his kids, but they want nothing to do with their mother. None of her family does. Every time she sees me at work she just inappropriately brags about all the dick she's riding on Tinder and tells me that the rest of our family is ""so cruel for not supporting her"". **This woman is nearly 50.**


Don't think for a single moment that dating an older women will yield greater quality. **Older women are still women, no matter what.**",120,1
"The young mind,The Frame, And the Framework.","Going to start out by saying im not a writer or a theory crafter and English is not my first language, with that being said.

&gt;Frame

I think we can all agree here that the most important thing for a man is his frame, there is no way around that. But most importantly there is no way to fake it. Me and my friend often talk about faking confidence, he believes there is no way to fake it at all, I believe in limited short interaction/special environments (clubs, raves, all that) you can with the help of a framework, (but that's not what this is about) 

&gt;Framework

TRP is a framework, but it does not automatically give you the frame you think you need or even want. For example I used to work with this guy who presented real feminine (imagine young professor with elbow patches on his jackets) dude would talk feelings, dress in cardigans and all that while he had the most alpha frame I have ever seen, guy definitely had no idea wtf TRP is but he was more alpha then even the previously mention friend (6 foot tall muscular and had PIs on his tail for cucking another dude) and it showed, he was fucking left and right and had unshakable confidence that radiated (body langues and all the non verbal stuff). He had frame but no TRP framework (most importantly I want to highlight guy seemed very satisfied with his job, life, and relationships)

What I see on here and IRL is people have the opposite condition, or there trying to achieve the frame with the framework.

&gt;The young mind

Now this is where I want to get in to the criticism/traps of TRP. Lets start out with those that don't yet have a framework. The position one is in without a framework is imo best shown in this trippy post modern deconstruction of the modern condition (and its depressions) take some acid sit back and let your brain ride this [meta advice](https://youtu.be/WYhhUcYN4mw) in the form of a Socratic dialogue.

Now TRP is an appealing ""first"" Framework (at least the first consciously chosen one) the surface level promises are appealing and the Framework provides structure and guidance to follow that explains the world as you interact with it. But to only have one framework is to lack critical thinking and it is to make broad generalizations that can bite you in the ass (Lets be real how many TRP followers do you know that dehumanize and really just follow this path because they are bitter) plus analysis paralysis is a possible side effect. 

Here is an example: [HER - Why You Suck at Dating ‚Äì Wisecrack Edition](https://youtu.be/m3RRuhxu0Z4) most peoples knee jerk reaction would be to call this lib bluepill shit. However if you take a look the video it describes Hypergamy, Codependency, and frame, not using TRP language but the concepts are all still there. Now you can see how because of the singular framework you might have narrowed your mind. 

&gt;Whats my point? 

When you have only one framework of reference its like viewing the world though one color or lens, this can also lead to developing the framework in to an identity (that may or may not even suit you) This is of course most prominent with the younger crowd. Now im not gonna lie many people here and that get introduced to TRP are mostly reactionaries and I believe this stems from the framework or its mutations, a man with a alpha frame is usually not reactionary for he has the real confidence to not have to imagine an idolized past or the need to get by from some sort of nostalgia for it, when you have the alpha frame you just do shit idk how else to say/describe. Now for many aspects of life I believe lessons have to be learned on failure and lessons learned from a bad framework imo outweigh the minor successes with a good framework as it enables much more future successes and makes you a more defined person. 

&gt;Frame pt.2 

There are many frameworks, I believe TRP is just a big one that is life encompassing (there are things outside of sex and woman yo) But there are other frames out there, many smaller ones (sciences) some bigger (philosophy). Now I believe the only way to have confidence, real confidence, is with success. The way you can build success is by being a more defined person and applying yourself (including through a framework) and if you have many frameworks (or the meta framework discussed in the Frameworthless video) you can start succeeding in those frameworks (think grinding stats in a game, whats easier a high level single stat grind or low level scatter grind in multiple stats). That will build total confidence which in turn feeds your frame. It also has the added benefit of giving you classical critical thinking and multiple solution to life problems that you can individually evaluate from previous successes/failures, as well as the ability to string together multiple frameworks (including TRP).",4,1

I was able to get the best deal I could get in a situation like this. A one year suspension. If you‚Äôre wondering I am not mad. I am blessed and grateful that I was not expelled. I am doing fine and this in no way will effect my future. However, it was the best out of the situation. 

Here are the suggestions my law firm told me in the end.

1. Do not engage in one night stands in this climate, especially with alcohol involved. I was shocked to hear this, but I trust this response considering this is one of the most high profile firms int eh country, and sexual assault is all they deal with.

2. If you are a college student, try and avoid hyper sexual culture. Girls nowadays think they can have sex and be liberated without the consequences of being called a hoe. Don‚Äôt allow them to make you their scape goat for their actions.

3. Saving your text messages and having context helps, but it will not save you. I had all the texts and evidence and it still was not enough. The judicators or mediators often fare more about the context as to what happened, ‚Äúcould have happened‚Äù, or what ‚Äúmore than likely happened‚Äù in university sexual assault cases. 

4. If you‚Äôre a university student, just like understanding sexual consent rules, you should be aware of how far the school is willing to let you go to protect yourself. Sexual assault cases in school are not like the criminal court. In criminal court it‚Äôs much much easier to protect yourself, and most of the times charges are acquitted and you walk free. This is not the same for university campuses, where prosecutors have to prove that sexual assault could have had a greater than 50% chance of happening.

5. You need affirmative consent prior to having sex every time, and consent is on going, and can be withdrawn at any moment.",16,1

"Good kid, rose city: Rose City ANTIFA and terrorist global justice","Terrorist or freedom fighter, the classification of groups that employ political violence are hotly contested, one group could be on a terrorist database in one state but considered a civil rights group in another. In the eyes of all terrorist organisations, they are not terrorists but activists striving for their conception of justice; they are martyrs fighting for their vision of happiness and security. Rose City ANTIFA (RCA)  members throw themselves into fire and steel in Portland in the name of their ideals; this essay discusses the justification of RCA‚Äôs ideas of global justice and how they mobilise them to recruit followers and sympathy for their organisations; this is achieved through comparing definitions of terrorism with RCA‚Äôs actions,  and comparing their ethos with themes of cosmopolitan justice.

# Terrorism‚Äôs wide definition

Defining terrorism is difficult due to its broad nature, to give a universalist conception of terrorism is to limit the perspective of civil rights groups and marginalise civil rights movements that are paramilitary in nature such as the American Revolutionary War. Whereas specific definitions are kept out of reach by changing contexts and wide assumptions, arguably the prevailing condition of terrorist acts is fear (Cooper, 2001). Fear is generated by terrorist attacks with the purpose of destroying a collective support for leaders or policies that the agents of violence oppose (Carr, 2007); yet, the generation of fear is a common tactic in warfare (Ganor, 2002), what makes terrorism abhorred by international society? First, terrorism as an objective action is shunned as it deliberately targets non-combatants: Azzam distinguished terrorist acts from his ideas of jihad in his *fatwa* rejecting the targeting of civilians directed towards Al-Qaeda (Gunaratna, 2002, 22). Second, terrorism ignores institutions of international society such as war and rule of law: Ganor (2002) distinguished guerrilla fighters and terrorists as guerrillas respected institutions of war by establishing themselves in areas and remaining combatants until the end of conflict; whereas, terrorists ignore institutions of war by shifting between non-combatant and combatant to adapt to situations and ignoring the civil protections of non-combatants in war through their ignorance of law in attacks (Carr, 2007). The base conditions that define a terrorist act is violence with the goal of inciting terror to achieve a stated or implicit political, religious, or ideological goal (Aven and Guikema, 2015), this definition implies terrorism is an act, and that terrorists are individuals that commit to terrorism.

# Rose City ANTIFA

Before the comparison can begin, RCA needs to be introduced: RCA is a left-wing extremist group founded in 2007 (Michel, 2017) to oppose right-wing politics through direct action operations of physical violence and mental abuse towards its subscribers, state or civilian; and use of arson and sabotage to hinder them in any way (Bray, 2017). They created the Torch Network in 2013 (Copsey, 2018) to connect, and spread awareness of ANTIFA groups in the US and are currently the most senior ANTIFA organisation in the nation; but, they are not a group that purely exist to oppose right-wing politics, RCA specifically espouses socialism with a militant approach, it strives for a classless society without divisions of gender, wealth, and states and achieve this through mobilisation of society to their values (Bray, 2017). 

Recent civil rights movements in the U.S. have provided a wealth of information on RCA‚Äôs actions, the distinguishing of RCA‚Äôs actions from terrorism and popular protest is difficult to achieve due to the ambiguity of their members; but, it is consistent with historical examples of left-wing terrorism. RCA‚Äôs tactics are self-described as ‚ÄúArt and Struggle‚Äù (Copsey, 2018): the demonisation of rightism in posters, artworks, social media, and street art; and use of sabotage and violence against perceived right-wing entities. RCA regularly brandishes anti-right art in popular protests (Beauchamp, 2020) and publishes them on their Tumblr account (Antifa International, 2020). In addition to these protests, RCA also engages in organised violence using popular protest as an ambiguous cover, utilising improvised explosive devices and weapons in chaotic riots against public servants and counter-protestors (jseattle, 2020), training their members to deliver grievous bodily harm in clandestine manners (Washington Times, 2020) and sabotage operations as seen with the destruction of government records in Multnomah, Oregon (FBI, 2020) by black-clad individuals: the uniform of RCA (RCA, 2020). 

It is important to note that RCA targets civilians as well as state institutions and public servants as they publicly harass anyone who displays right-wing beliefs as seen with the harassment of American-Vietnamese journalist Andy Ngo (Beauchamp, Z. 2020) and the request of right wing individual‚Äôs home addresses and car licence plates (RCA, 2020) to plan their harassment. These tactics are largely consistent with other left-wing terrorist organisations such as the Australian Liberation Army (Campion, 2020) which also relied on arson and bombings within and outside protest movements. While the tactics of RCA may have correlations with other terrorist groups, what truly makes them terrorists is fear. RCA justifies their terrorism through their stance on utilitarianism (Gray, 2008): whereas Mill believed that no one‚Äôs inherent rights and freedoms should be infringed on one‚Äôs path to happiness. RCA views individuals as giving up inherent rights and freedoms when they adopt right wing beliefs. RCA utilises fear to silence right-wing entities or coerce them to accept leftist values (Bray, 2017) through violent attacks and popular protests.

The public viciousness of RCA serves a dual purpose: to threaten rightists; and publicise their organisation. This phenomenon is similar to Al-Qaeda‚Äôs recruitment tactics of high visibility of attacks and perpetuation of its practices through the textual discussion of the organisation to draw in those interested in its values (Schoeneborn and Scherer, 2012). RCA recruits through formation of autonomous cells with their approval through distributing articles on forming them and insulating them from intelligence agencies (Anonymous, 2001) through the Torch Network (Torch, 2020). RCA also directly recruits individuals: RCA welcomes applications and accepts members based on their past activist history and sharing of RCA articles and beliefs on their social media (RCA, 2020). The acts of RCA serve to draw in individuals to investigate the organisation and expose them to their beliefs, their conditions of recruitment look for committed people that proselytise their beliefs and spread their ideas of global justice.

# Global Justice

The acts of RCA are justified by justice: the ideas of who deserves what and why, and a commitment to address moral inequalities (Coacci, 2020). RCA‚Äôs conception of justice is expanded to global bounds as they believe all humans have a right to liberty, but those whom infringe on others liberty lose this right to liberty (Bray, 2017), they also reject states as vehicles of justice (Torch, 2020) and rely on grass roots groups worldwide to address inequality. These conceptions of justice are consistent with cosmopolitan justice due to their implications.

RCA‚Äôs monotheistic approach to justice through directing its operations towards any who oppose them indicate a singular, universalist conception of justice: that happiness and security is achieved through classless societies (Beitz, 2004). This implication is consistent with cosmopolitan ideas of justice: justice as an agreed upon conception must be applied globally (Coacci, 2020). Specifically, RCA‚Äôs beliefs correlate with Rawlsian definitions of justice: that justice is the fair distribution of fundamental benefits and burdens throughout global society, and these benefits and burdens do not need legal recognition to be respected (Coacci, 2020). The intolerance of RCA is an address to the limits of Rawlsian global justice: that without a global community possessing a common social and cultural life, no singular conception of justice can be achieved (Goodhart, 2002). 

RCA‚Äôs ideas of global justice may stem from Rawlsian cosmopolitanism, but their methodology is firmly rooted in Pogge‚Äôs ideas to implement cosmopolitan justice. Pogge espoused the dispersal of sovereignty to communities than states (Pogge, 1992) as statist conceptions of justice ensure the protection of state than individual sovereignty (Coacci, 2020). The Poggeian belief that human rights should be enforced by fellow compatriots also strongly reflects the fear tactics RCA employs against the right-wing (Pogge, 1992): as RCA sees themselves as people defending liberties of the marginalised and seeks to prevent further oppression through militant action against the oppressors (RCA, 2020).

Ironically, despite using popular protests, the key justification of RCA to resort to terrorism than solely relying on methods that respect the rule of law is because RCA sees state justice superstructures as ‚Äútools of the fascists‚Äù (Torch, 2020). The socialist beliefs of RCA are largely incompatible with ideas of state sovereignty as they view courts and laws as controlled by the right wing to limit the influence of their organisation (Bray, 2017); thus, they view ‚ÄúArt and Struggle‚Äù to be their only valid way of initiating grass-roots change but also rely on institutions of representative democracy such as popular protest.

RCA uses these ideas of global justice to recruit followers through espousing their ideas of a classless society. RCA‚Äôs idea of a classless society is achieved through the dismantling of traditional divisions of race, gender, and states. They see divisions between gender as an opportunity for marginalisation and believes states as tools of oppression by the right-wing (Bray, 2017). They publicise their beliefs and rely on people reaching out to them to gain potential followers, aspirants meet with an RCA member who interviews them to determine their suitability of ideology and utility to the organisation (Richardson, 2020).  But if RCA is a militant group that disavows statist institutions, why do they simply not press gang individuals akin to the child soldiers of Kony? This is because RCA utilises ideas of global justice, simply because they truly believe in the ideas and principles they promote, in their various guides on constructing an ANTIFA cell, they encourage ANTIFA groups to communicate with marginalised communities and defend their interests (Torch, 2020). Thus, potential recruits of RCA are drawn from a desire to protect the disenfranchised and punish the oppressors; these recruits agree with RCA‚Äôs approach to justice and apply to join the organisation.

# Conclusion

RCA is a terrorist group that utilises moral cosmopolitanism to justify their direct action and psyops operations against right-wing entities; through organised violence such as arson, sabotage, and harassment of individuals; and distribution of articles advertising their beliefs and demonising their opposition, RCA uses physical and mental violence to generate fear in state authorities and civilians to weaken support for policies and individuals that they disapprove of. They justify these actions through their beliefs in Rawlsian cosmopolitanism: that justice is the fair distribution of rights and burdens throughout global society but promote it through Poggeian methodology of eschewing statist institutions of justice such as courts and laws for community approaches where compatriots instead of states protect and enforce rights and liberties.

The publicised harassment and violence spread through news media and social media is used to attract followers by generating textual discussion of the group and attracting followers that are committed to their mission and agree with their conceptions of global justice. RCA utilises ideas of global justice to recruit followers and create new cells through promotion of their cosmopolitan ideas of justice and its protection through their articles, social media, artwork, and protests throughout Portland. Terrorists all utilise ideas of global justice to attract followers and justify their actions but using RCA as a case study is a valuable example of how the line between civil rights organisations and terrorist organisations is blurred and crossed when relying on an inherently terrorist methodology.

"No matter how happy you may be with a woman, forgetting TRP will leave you burned.","I've learned this the hard way quite recently, so learn from my mistake. There are definitely some purple-pill methods that can work to get a girl, but keeping her attraction long term is a different story entirely. I started out with Coach Corey Wayne's advice, and I definitely found more confidence and success with women, but his advice was also turning away the women I was initially attracting and I had no clue where I was going wrong. I've been familiar with TRP for years and understood many of their key concepts, but never practiced them.


I wound up in a fairly decent LTR, but due to my lack of exercise and bad eating habits I temporarily lost my libido and turned her down for sex once. That one shut down and the reasoning behind it caused her to lose all value for me within minutes and she broke things off over text. Without realizing, I also let myself become far too soft and fond of her so there was no more challenge with me. Clearly I'm better off with her, but that was a learning experience. I finally learned how to cook healthy homemade meals, started working out at home daily, and I was down 10lbs in a week and had my mojo back in full swing. I was also back to listening to CCW's videos to get my confidence back up, but I didn't realize what the ""purple pill"" was at the time, nor did I click in he was focused around it. His tactic of having her make definite plans with you worked to get me her, but it didn't let me keep her. I needed more. I found good and far more content from AMS (Alpha Male Strategies), Swole Alpha (underrated gem), and a mix-up of Elliott Hulse's content.


Despite this, I let myself slip again. A few weeks ago I met this astounding woman who was only a few years younger than me (I'm 27), and I've never found such a close connection in my many years of dating. We are both moderately successful in our own lives, have our own places, social circles, etc. We are both attractive and ambitious people. No children either, which is a total rarity in a city brimming with single mothers. While we didn't date for long, things kept getting better by the day. I never said anything mushy or feely like ""I miss you"" first, and maintained as much of an alpha frame as I could to gain her attraction. It worked, but the more we started talking, the fonder and more tender my heart became. She's easily the most beautiful woman I have dated and was easily a 10 in my book, and in a city where the other 98% of women are 5 or less, I was smitten. She didn't sleep around either and was relatively introverted, but we had almost all the same tastes in movies, relationship values, and our sexual tastes were practically identical. She was completely enthralled with me and would message me constantly, tell me she missed me, and would ask herself how she ""got so lucky to find a man so perfect"". She wanted to hear my voice before we went to bed and do cute special things together. The purple-pilled man's dream. However I tread lightly and didn't want to push her boundaries to lose her, so despite my desires we never even had sex where I'm normally getting laid on the first date. I figured this meal would be best slow-cooked to perfection. I respected her boundaries and went at her pace, but also didn't let myself be walked over and like the man, I made the decisions. Every time she put the ball in my court. Last night we had this cute little movie date over the phone because I got off work late, and she told me to pick a scary movie (despite her getting easily spooked) and kept telling me she wanted me to come cuddle her. When the credits hit she started to become super hot and bothered hearing my voice and seeing my Snapchats. Like, super horny. So I took this as a permission to move forward since she was the one who started it, because if I rejected her that would have wound up even worse. She sent me pictures, videos, I sent some back, and she begged for me. I've never been one for phone sex, but hot damn was it passionate. It just felt so right. Everything about this woman did, and I had a hard time believing I lucked out this much. That was my downfall. I became too comfortable and stopped consuming my redpill content to keep me vigilant. 5 minutes after, she sent me this txt saying she ""feels really bad and awkward about what we did"", how she's ""not like that"", and she then said, ""We have to stop pursuing this."" She lost all attraction for me in that moment and no matter what I said to her she didn't budge. She has this weird notion that people have to be ""perfect"" and have ""everything sorted out"" before they date anyone, and while that's true to an extent, nobody will have everything figured out all the time. It's about growing beside a strong partner and not relying on them, but making the journey together, but she didn't respond to any of it. She went out of her way to say hurtful things like how she would ""go date other men"" immediately after telling me she ""wasn't ready for a relationship"" and that she ""needed space"". She went from being this total angel to being one of the cruelest beings I've met in all my years of dating. This isn't an understatement either.


She pulled a complete 180, and looking back I'm still kind of baffled. I didn't let her feminize and walk over me, pursued my own purpose, and made her do most of the work and was careful not to validate her too much. I don't think I made many mistakes during the relationship, but after I did. I was reasonably upset by this, and she saw my reaction. She knew how much I was hurt by her ending everything over something she initiated. I didn't go full goober mode and beg, but I still showed her emotion I never should have validated her with. She knew how much I cared.


I forgot no matter how amazing the woman seems, and no matter how happy I was with her, she was still exactly what she is. A woman. A formulaic woman who's behaviors could be seen from a mile away. So I snapped my finger and told myself I would stop caring about her. I became completely emotionally unattached. She was straight up trying to push me into the friend zone (which I don't believe exists) and said ""Be my friend platonically or I'm not going to talk to you again"". I told her I was no longer emotionally invested in her and that I don't make friends with romantic interests, let alone women. That it's a net loss of time in my book. Despite doing what she did, she immediately said ""I'm not sure why but that makes me sad"". She can't even understand her own female emotions. I was no longer giving her the validation of caring about her while she was walking me to the curb. She kept trying to push why and I told her ""Because that's how I do things. I will never disrespect myself enough to be put in that box. You know why I'm interested. I have more than enough friends and goals to keep me busy. If you want to be in my life at all after this, you know exactly what I want out of it. Take it or leave it. I'll be busy with my thing, but if you're ever ready and I'm still single, shoot me a message. I won't be your friend, but I'll just be present."" She then started to backpedal and say she wanted me to be sweet to her but didn't want to hurt me anymore. The further I set in the fact to her that I no longer cared or was invested in her, the more she started to come around.


I should have never forgot the Redpill simply because I was happy and content in my relationship, and neither should you. No matter how perfect and amazing you think she is, she's still a woman, and will leave you burned if you're not vigilant.",216,1

We often wonder why when we communicate with a girl we tend not to be understood or they just don't understand what we mean. It can even happen that it's the other way around, that is, that her words don't make sense or that she's expressing herself in an inconsistent way.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to fully understand how women communicate, I guess we have to refer to the basics, which are children.

&amp;#x200B;

Between an adult man and a young child, there is a world of difference. In order to help and educate them in their journey, a challenge is necessary: communication.

Why?

\- The child uses speech as a utilitarian medium 

\- It has an absence of logical thinking unlike the adult.

How do we communicate well with a child?

&amp;#x200B;

1.	Speech as a utilitarian medium

The problem here, is that the child is unable to represent something, he doesn't have enough neurons inside his brain yet. There is a distinction between the utilitarian and communicative use of the external world of speech. One of the factors is related to the knowledge of representation, in other words he does not have the vocabulary to express what he wants to say. The other factor is related to the capacity of representation, it is abstract.

&amp;#x200B;

So to describe his internal world, he will use games or drawings. What will help him is to represent in his head what he feels.

If we draw a parallel with the woman, what we deduce is that she does the same thing as a child. Indeed to communicate with her entourage, she will exclaim, get angry, say things without values, to attract attention or to say nothing.

The woman undoubtedly has the necessary neurons to express herself, but she does not use them properly.

How many times has a woman complained about nothing or to get attention. She has sulked for no reason or has become distant without explaining anything. The fact is that she may not be able to adequately express how she feels, so she communicates in a different way that is not always easy to grasp. It is therefore up to us to decipher this behaviour.

&amp;#x200B;

2.	Lack of logical thinking

In the child's inner world EVERYTHING works with emotional, impulsive and fantasy thoughts.

He understands the world based on what he feels, it is in the immediate, here and now.

The association with women here is very clear and precise. Women have never really had it at a logical level, let's think about mathematics, how many of them are going to fill the benches of the social sciences because they don't contain linear algebra. They don't have logic.

Science suggests that the male brain is structured to facilitate action and coordination, while the female brain is more towards communication and intuitive processes.

Then, the female lets herself be controlled by her impulses and emotions, she stands out by her unusual states of mind. Everything is based on what they feel here and now, she changes her attitude in 2 seconds if she wishes.

&amp;#x200B;

If you disagree with me, look carefully at the behavior of the females around you.

Opinion is so much the queen of the world that when reason wants to fight it, reason is condemned to death.

#Introduction/ Note to the reader 

Dear reader, 


I‚Äôve done a lot of fucked up shit for some pussy. I‚Äôve lied to women, emotionally manipulated them, promised them shit then didn‚Äôt deliver‚Ä¶ yeah, I‚Äôve got demons. 

This is an extremely long post because I‚Äôm giving you a shit load of examples. Chances are, if you‚Äôre not a complete virgin, you‚Äôll see a bit of yourself through the examples even if you didn‚Äôt live them exactly as I did.  

If you are a complete virgin or you‚Äôre new to TRP, the examples are there for you to avoid as you progress. All the pussy in the world doesn‚Äôt mean a thing if you can‚Äôt even look in the mirror without seeing all the pain you‚Äôve caused to our mothers, daughters, and sisters. 

I hate what I‚Äôve become. Don‚Äôt be like me.

I held Carly tightly as her tears soaked my sleeveless shirt. It‚Äôs hard seeing a woman cry, especially when you know in your heart of hearts you‚Äôre the cause of her tears. 

 ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I promise you I‚Äôm not crying. I‚Äôm just sweating a lot‚Ä¶‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt answer. I continued to feel her hot tears seep through my shirt. 

‚ÄúYou know, I really really like you‚Ä¶‚Äù 

I stayed silent for a while.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to be okay,‚Äù I finally reassured her, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to be okay.‚Äù

I cried myself to sleep the night Emily left. I was 16 years old and she was my first and last love. One day she came into class with tears streaming down her face. I smiled. I knew it was my time to shine. I let her walk all over me in hopes of winning her heart. I gave her the answers to every quiz, did her homework, brought her flowers, made her cookies. All she did was take it in stride. She got alpha widowed by some jacked volleyball player and was using me for attention. At the time, I couldn‚Äôt have been more clueless. 

I went to my closest friend Johnny, Johnny was a pussy slayer. He had it all. The body, the bitches, the power; I wanted what he had. 

He laughed when I told him about what happened to me. 

‚ÄúYou need to take the redpill,‚Äù he told me in between bouts of wheezing laughter.   

I read the sidebar like the bible. 

I praised the Gods of Iron daily, now I'm on my way to setting a state record. 

I became a man.

The metal music blasting in my ears was rudely interrupted by my ringtone.

‚ÄúHey, are we still good for tonight?‚Äù  

I just failed another PR and this bitch has the audacity to think I give a fuck about our date? 

‚ÄúAnna, no. I‚Äôm busy. Go do something else.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBut I was looking forward to-‚Äù 

‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt give a shit. I‚Äôm busy.‚Äù 

I hung up.  

I didn‚Äôt want her to know how excited I was to see her.

‚ÄúBabe‚Ä¶ you like me, right?‚Äù 

I really wanted her to stop talking. I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at her thighs. Judy was a clingy bitch but my god I wanted her to choke me in between those things. 

Oh, she asked me a question? 

‚ÄúYeah yeah I like you. You‚Äôre cool.‚Äù 

She paused. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ cool?‚Äù 

I wondered what her bra size was. Double D‚Äôs? Maybe? Who knows. Tiddies. 

‚ÄúDo you even really like me? You never open up. All you do is let me compliment you and you always brush it off and tear me down.‚Äù 

‚ÄúJesus, babe I‚Äôm joking.‚Äù 

Judy tilted her head down. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just passing time‚Ä¶‚Äù 

She was right, but I could never let her know that. 

I gave her a tight hug and kissed her on the forehead.

‚ÄúSo, we‚Äôre okay, right, babe? You like me?‚Äù 

‚ÄúOf course baby.‚Äù 

I lied. I didn‚Äôt like her. I liked doing whatever the fuck I wanted to her. 

The next morning I kissed her goodbye. As I drove off I looked in my rearview mirror and saw a fabricated grin and wide eyes. I knew it would be the last time I saw her.

Anna‚Äôs eyes were bloodshot red.

‚ÄúScepter might as well work at the fucking gym.‚Äù 

I looked her up and down. 

‚ÄúDamn, you didn‚Äôt have to do me like tha-‚Äù 

‚ÄúAm I wrong, though? You treat me like shit whenever something doesn‚Äôt go right in someplace filled with sweaty dudes. We get it, you‚Äôre strong, but when will you actually be **kind?**‚Äù

Kind?

*‚ÄúYou never stop loving someone. You just learn to live without them.‚Äù - Tupac Shakur*

Emily sent me an email after all these years. She said she ‚Äúthought about me‚Äù and just wanted to ‚Äúcatch-up.‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt waste any time getting her number. This is it; I‚Äôm gonna fuck the girl that turned me into the psychopathic monster I am now. 

Or so I thought. I called her to ‚Äúcatch-up‚Äù and set up a date. 

I‚Äôll never forget the fear in her voice when she answered the phone. She just wanted the old me. The me that loved her. The me that would cherish her at all costs. She wasn‚Äôt expecting who I had become. Whoever had fucked her over did a great job. 

I didn‚Äôt care. I just wanted to fuck her. How poetic would that be? Fucking the woman that put you through so much emotional turmoil. 

She was going on and on about how excited she was to talk to me and about what *really* happened to her during high school. I just kept saying ‚Äúuh-huh‚Äù waiting for my chance to cut her off. 

‚ÄúLook, Emily, I feel really bad for you, and I think you‚Äôre in a shitty situation. We should go out tomorrow night.‚Äù 

Her voice changed from excited to monotone. She realized I was just going to pump her and dump her like all the rest and I was no longer just the soft listening ear she once knew. 

She said she‚Äôd ‚Äúlet me know.‚Äù I hung up the phone. 

I never heard from her again.

I kicked the sugar baby out of my hotel without paying her. Whatever. Women lie to us and treat us like shit all the time. Why can‚Äôt I? Besides, she should be lucky a jacked motherfucker like me did whatever he could to fuck her.

I layed down on the hotel bed. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I could still smell her on the bedsheets. Her widened eyes when she realized I scammed her haunted me.  

I just want to get rid of my bleeding heart. Why can't I shed my humanity?

*‚ÄúI see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations ‚Äî one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it ‚Äî you will regret both.‚Äù - Soren Kierkegaard*

Judy left. She said I didn‚Äôt love her enough. She said she felt uncomfortable and fearful around me. 

‚ÄúI need a man that‚Äôs going to actually love me. Actually cherish me and make me feel good. You‚Äôre a great man, Scepter, a strong one, but I need more than strength. Goodbye.‚Äù 

I felt bad for a total of 92 mins. But the kindness I could have shown her still haunts me to this day. 

Sorry, Judy. I was just another man that used you for your body.

*‚ÄúPeople with BPD are like people with third-degree burns over 90% of their bodies. Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement.‚Äù

Carly. Poor Carly. She has BPD and for some reason, I ‚Äúfeel right‚Äù according to her. She told me she loved me on the first date. I didn‚Äôt respond. She hugged me tightly and said 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt love me back. I wanna give everything to you, you feel right. I dunno. Something about you.‚Äù 

Yikes. This girl might actually mean what she said‚Ä¶ for now. 

Doesn‚Äôt matter. Free ass.  

I told her everything she wanted to hear and I didn't mean a word of it. 

""Yeah there's just something right about you too..."" 

""You feel right, I think we could be something..."" 

So on and so forth. 

I didn't think twice about what I was doing until she was resting her head in my lap. I looked into her eyes and saw a little girl that was never loved. I realized that she was hoping to get the love she's always craved from me. 

I was right. She went on to tell me about how her parents were never around and how her last boyfriend made her feel inadequate. I don't know if she was telling the truth or not but it doesn't matter. Her eyes told me the entire story. Something, or someone, had hurt her into becoming this BPD girl looking for somebody to ease her pain. She straightened up and I saw her eyes begin to water. She held me tightly and let it all out.


I cried on the way home. 

**I realized I was no better than the men who had damaged these women in the first place. I am the cause of their suffering, I am the cause of their agony, I am the cause of their pain.** 

I hate the monster I've become.

*For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. - Galatians 6:3*

I'm done hurting women just to feed my own ego. I'm not going to be a complete beta bitch, but I'm not gonna be a sadistic motherfucker either. Being cruel isn't good for my psyche, my frame, and the women that will have a large role in procreating the next generation.

I will be gentle, yet firm. 

Loving, yet bold. 

Kind, yet observant. 

This is the final stage of the redpill: Acceptance. Loving women for what they are and still being a man with pride that's on his mission and purpose.

I'm ready to learn how to love women again, and most importantly, learn how to love myself and earn my own self-respect. 

I'm ready to be human again.",107,1

"SNL with Hinge Girl on First Date, Facing LMR Shit Test","Quick field report here. Had a fun/interesting date last night that I'd like to share. 

# Initial Contact

Last Wednesday I matched with a girl on Hinge, 23 YO cute blonde HB8 former sorority type with a nice athletic body. 

We matched around 8 PM and messaged over the course of a few hours. By the fourth message we were talking about meeting, and I snagged her number before going to bed, telling her that I'd hit her up soon. 

I texted her the next day (Thursday) for logistics only and scheduled a date for Saturday night at 7:30. Like I've written in previous posts, make the date no more than 72 hours out.  On Saturday afternoon, I pinged her with my usual ""Hey, I'm still down to meet tonight."" Maybe that seems needy to some of you, but if she's gonna flake I wanna know so I can make other plans. She confirmed that she was still down though, so I let her know that I'd text her when I head out (important - I suspect many girls don't even leave their homes until you confirm that you're en route). 

# Date

I live in a major city where nightlife is more or less nonexistent due to Covid. The few outdoor bars require advance reservations. It's a huge pain in the ass. 

Instead I took this opportunity to experiment with a new idea. Rather than going for the typical drink at a bar, I met her at a waterfront park. Brought a blanket and some wine. She seemed to really like the idea when I first proposed it. It was a good vibe - lots of college kids in the city were down there drinking as well. Kino was a breeze because we were sitting so close together on the blanket. 

After an hour or whatever it was, I really needed to use the bathroom...and I mean badly. This not being a bar, of course there were no toilets around, and eventually it got to the point where I just couldn't hold it (pro-tip: don't drink a ton of water + have a cup of coffee before doing a date like this). I told her something like ""hey, hate to cut things short, but I need to go to the bathroom really badly."" I couldn't even think about escalating or anything at this stage - all I could think about was how I was going to relieve myself. 

Fortunately she made things easy for me and offered to let me use the bathroom at her place since she lived close by. 

# Sealing the Deal

After taking a nice long piss, we chatted in her room a bit and get on the subject of first impressions. She tells me I'm intimidating. 

""Why's that?"" I ask. 

""Because you're hot as fuck."" 

Obviously we start making out furiously, and here's where it gets interesting. As I start taking her clothes off, she starts hitting me with the usual LMR/ASD fare - ""I don't have sex on the first date,"" ""This is my one rule,"" ""I don't want to be a one-night stand,"" etc. But while her words said one thing, her body language and tone indicated something totally different. She said it playfully; I could tell she didn't really mean it. 

I backed off just a little bit and said something like ""yeah?"" as if I was only half listening. We chit chatted a bit, but I kept up kino by lighting stroking her hand. When our faces got close, I waited for her to kiss me, which she soon did. This back-and-forth went on for some time, with her continuing to insist that we weren't going to have sex. 

Eventually when we started kissing again, I gently tugged a fistful of her hair, which made her moan a bit. 

""Oh you like that , huh?""

""Yeah. I like domination."" 

""Yeah? What about this?"" I said, putting my hand around her throat and pressing lightly. 

""Yessss"" 

I withdrew again, just giving her little kisses. ""You're thinking about what it going to be like, aren't you?"" 

""Yeahhhh"" 

I teased her a bit more before I took her by the throat and shoved her down into the bed, then pinned her arms back above her head. She fucking loved it. In the heat of the moment, I got up and yanked her pants off. This time she didn't resist. Before I entered her, I made her beg for it. 

""Please Daddy, give it to me, I need it..."" 

# Takeaways

**Hot Girls Are Easier:** For some of you, this field report might not be that interesting. Honestly I don't feel like I did much to get in her pants. This girl made it pretty easy compared with others who were much less attractive. YMMV, but in my experience, hotter girls are generally easier to lay and more fun to be with in general. 

**Hinge:** I checked out the Hinge sub to see how many other people are getting SNLs. By and large, it seems that the bloopers over there are waiting multiple dates or even months before having sex. Fuck that noise. 

**Don't be boring:** Due to the pandemic, I've been experimenting with different date ideas that aren't the usual ""sitting at a table in a generic bar."" I think the wine and blanket park date excited her because it was different. Think outside of the box. 

**ASD/LMR:** I'm still not convinced that these concepts are real. On some level, this girl wanted the D from the moment she met me. Clearly she knew the implications of inviting me back to ""use the bathroom."" If anything, the ""LMR"" was just a minor shit test. Probably she also wanted to convince me (and herself) that she wasn't ""easy.""  She had already put in a lot of legwork by bringing me back. Now it was up to me to ""wear her down"" (as she would later put it) and make the actual sex *my* doing. 

Many guys get very confused on this point. I think there's a difference between a girl giving a shit test in the bedroom and a girl who is genuinely hesitant about fucking you. In the first scenario, she'll be playful, and her body language will indicate that she's very much into the thought of banging. It's token resistance. 

But when a girl is hesitant, she'll take on a flat, business-like tone of voice, and her body language won't be receptive. She just isn't that into the thought of banging you. There's not enough genuine desire. In these cases, I terminate the interaction. I have neither the patience nor the desire to bang a girl who isn't desperate to bang me back.",3,1

"After 6 years of following TRP but being an incel, joined the army and suddenly started succeeding with women.","I'm a 24 year old guy and I have been into the red pill since I was 17. I have constantly read RP literature, lifted weights, tried to utilize an understanding of female behavior to implement RP behaviors of my own. I was...unsuccessful to say the least. During college I largely failed at dating. In fact from 20 onwards I did not so much as receive a kiss on the cheek from a girl and I felt terrible about myself. I was also addicted to porn and masturbation. 

When I left for army basic training last october (shortly after I turned 23) I instantly noticed that I was having a great time talking to all the females and they somehow seemed to be attracted to my skinny, pale, shaved head self. One girl I snuck away to make out with a few times, which is the first time I had kissed a girl in 3 years. Then in AIT (the training after basic where you have a little more freedom to get away with stuff) I hung out with two very pretty girls the whole time. One of them gave me blowjobs in a broom closet twice. At that point I still had a short buzz cut and didn't even look that great. But the girls liked me and it was an amazing boost to my confidence. I could have gotten into a lot of trouble if I was caught but it was 110% worth it.

When I returned from training the pandemic hit and I lost all the muscle I gained at basic training due to isolation and a resurgence of my depression. And even so, many girls have shown interest in me this summer. The girls on the dating apps love my army pictures. I have hooked up with 3 different girls over the summer until I started dating my new girlfriend last month. She works at the coffee place I go to and after we had been talking every day a while she wrote her number on my cup. obviously I promptly asked her out after that. I have fucked her 35 times in 5 weeks (I know because of the # of condoms I have used), more than all the times that I had sex before I met her. She says straight up to me ""I love having sex with you"". 

My girlfriend is not a supermodel but she looks great to me. The fact that she 100% meets my standards in terms of looks blows my mind. I always thought that I would have to date a girl who is fat or asian (nothing wrong with asian girls, it's just a fact they tend to date white guys at a lower standard. But I am not attracted to them). But she is not fat, she's white (jewish like me) has a nice ass and tits and is cute. Also she is 18.

When I am with her I think about RP principles all the time. We talk a lot so when notice I am getting shit tested and I take care to say the right things and change the subject with her when necessary. I don't overshare with her. I don't compliment her too much. I don't text her too much and I don't act clingy. I pay for our takeout (thanks covid) a few times a week but otherwise don't spend money on her. Most importantly I am very physical with her whenever we are together, we fuck multiple times every time we hang out. All of these things I learned years ago on TRP but never had the opportunity to actually use them. Now it is all coming together.

The one thing I did against the RP doctrine was entering an LTR and I will address that. I have concluded this is the best strategy for me at this moment. For one there is a pandemic right now. I fully intend to fuck this one girl at least 1 thousand times, and I have no problem turning down other girls so that I can accomplish that goal. Also I feel very comfortable holding my frame in this exclusive relationship as she was the one who decided to get involved with me in the first place. So obviously she has to be in the relationship on my terms. She knows I have a bunch of female friends and whether it's true or not, probably thinks that I would have no problem dumping her and getting a new girlfriend. For that reason, this LTR seems to be working great so far. If everything goes according to plan, I will continue to fuck her all the time for the next year until she goes to college (she is taking a gap year right now). If our relationship ends at that point, I will be fine with it.

Lessons learned: Not much changed in my life except for joining the army. I am in the national guard (kind of like the reserves but with more opportunities to get involved) and I was lucky enough to land a full time national guard job within a few months (that was always my plan). Active duty is a pretty good gig too as you work full time right off the bat. Either way you go through the same 5-7 months of training depending on what job you have. This has many benefits like getting you off drugs/alcohol/porn/masturbation, taking your phone away so you develop social skills, dealing with stress and challenges so you become less of a pussy, and of course building muscle. Basic training was easily the best experience of my life so far.

At the end of the day, my efforts to be ""red pilled"" and ""confident"" were useless as I didn't have shit to be confident about. Girls can see through that and I just came off as a jaded autist. Girls certainly don't want to date unemployed guys, but they also don't want to date guys who make minimum wage or only 15 an hour (even if they themselves make minimum). Now that I make 50k a year girls look at me with more respect. It has nothing to do with gold digging because paying for a few meals is fucking nothing. If anything it actually has more to do with my personal confidence and feeling good about myself because I feel like I have a purpose in life. Girls notice.

For young guys out there who are feeling lost, joining the army is a great option. Active or reserve component, before or after college, it depends on what is right for you. But I can't stress it enough how enlisting has made me so much happier and more fulfilled.

Finally, never give up. It might take you a long time to actually benefit from the red pill. I am glad that I never gave into the idea that I was not attractive enough or I was doomed to be an incel forever. Everything you read here about your behavior, actions, and status being the key to attracting women is true and correct. As a man, you can change for the better and women will start to flock to you.

A poll about porn use and sexual objectification (for school project),[removed],1,1
Allow people to make their own choices by become an example for the world,"Everyone has their own life and rules that they live by. Some people believe in good and bad, and most people justify their actions as good or bad based upon whatever they feel makes the most sense to them. Some people more heavily rely on a cost/benefit thought process to justify their actions. However, most of the time good and bad is justified away until it fits the model. 


Women in particular are very good at creating justifications for their actions and thoughts. Then, the media, their family, and their friends help to back up their decisions and thoughts. Men who are swept up by the logic, ‚ÄúIf it applies to women, it applies to me,‚Äù are also made victim of the thought process. Since most of the world has turned into a singular sex, from here on out I‚Äôm going to refer to women and men alike as ‚Äúpeople‚Äù.


Despite all of this, there is something in us that makes us want to tell people how to live their lives. We always tell them the ‚Äúbest way‚Äù to do things (or at least what we believe). We tell them what they should be doing. 


99% of the time, when people talk about their problems or come to speak to us in general, they are doing so in order to get someone to listen to them. They don‚Äôt want to hear what they should of done, or what you would of done. Now, of course, if they ask, lay it out there for them. But, if you pay attention, most of the time they won‚Äôt ask. 


This thought process is typically carried over in other ways. For example, when you tell someone to do something, and they don‚Äôt, your validation does not come to fruition, and anger arises as a result. 


There are plenty more examples of this idea at work. However, the underlying idea of all things related to this has a root somewhere. That root is that you should give up the faux sense of control that you have over others, and instead act as an example for them. Then, let them choose and make their own decisions about your example.  You should be an example for the world around you, and in this way, allow yourself to be open to critical judgment, without allowing yourself to waiver.


As a result, people will no longer come to tell you their problems, and instead they will start their conversations off with, ‚ÄúHow did you...‚Äù And, some people will no longer ask, and instead they will begin to mimic. 




Ultimately, this how is how respect is built, and, in the end, you‚Äôve done more for yourself and others without ever opening your mouth.",16,1

The Story of a Blue Pill (girl runs with $70k),"Found this on Quora:  


*My friend has never gone to college. But he is very hard working. He did the most the basic work at a factory for ten hours a day and with only two days of vacation per month.*

*My friend told me that he was in a relationship and that he met the girl at the factory.*

*Well, I didn‚Äôt doubt that girl at first. Yet, I felt that this girl was not taking their relationship seriously when I had dinner with them. I warned my friend and he was just pissed off because of my word.*

*This girl is from another province and we barely know her. She lied to my friend to marry him. She said that he needs to pay the girl‚Äôs parents 70,000 US dollars. Basically, the man needs to pay the women‚Äôs parents if a man and a women is getting a married. It is a kind of custom in China.*

*When I knew about this thing, I felt very unsettled. I advised him to be extremely cautious as his money was hard earned and that it doesn't come easily working at a factory.*

*He didn‚Äôt listen to me. He was even very happy about this ‚Äúfake‚Äù marriage. I can‚Äôt believe that he is so stupid.*

*After he gave the money to the girl, she ran away in the middle of the night. THIS IS SUCH A BITCHY THING TO DO.*

*When he lost all his saving and the girl too, he felt like he had lost his soul.*  
*He had no desire to work after that and he resigned. As a result, he had no place to live without a paycheck either.*

*I suggested for him to live in my house for a period of time. But he refused.*

*So he lived on the street and slept on a stone bench in the park at nights. He would stuff his mobile phone, a bank card ID, and a wallet with no money inside his pants and tighten his belt so that things would not get stolen when he fell asleep.*

*I helped him to ask police for help. But the girl was missing. And he is just so stubborn, he stopped contacting me gradually. I was so worried about him. Not much I could do for him.*

*He used to be easily influenced by online comments. He believed that women were only into spending money. He also believed that women only looked at money as a man‚Äôs worth.*

*Naturally, when he met this girl he liked, he kept spending money. Due time, he was finally cheated by her completely from his 70,000 US dollars in savings, his hope, and his life.*

*I just wanna warn you guys to not get influenced by the cyber languages and not to give up hope for life especially because of a bad relationship/s we ever had.*

"On authority and skepticism, you fools.","So I posted something, it got more attention than expected. Then BAAAM, i was an expert in the application of TRP in third world countries. I got tons of messages of people trying to connect, and asking me for advice.

Asking me for advice... I had to start every sentence with "" I'm not expert my post just got sudden attention."" If i didn't, and pretended mastery non of you would've noticed. If that's the case, holy shit you are all doomed and so is the entire community.

TRP's entire analogy is based upon critical thought: I question the herd thus i want to get to the truth. Similar to Plato's cave analogy. If thats the basis of this community, then why do people flock to anyone and everyone asking for advice as if they are the reincarnation of Doan Juan? 

PLEASE, question authority. Question information from authority. Understand that information bias is real and no-one is willingly a fool or misinformed. If you are not critical of your information and sources, you are a fool. Please do not ask anyone's advice, for your own benefit.

The Fuckbin,"We‚Äôre all familiar with ‚ÄúThe Friendzone‚Äù ‚Äì when a guy who wants something more with a girl gets himself relegated to friendship only, usually with the magic words, *‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Just Be Friends‚Äù*. Many a guy has lamented his tragic friendzoning (despite it being completely his own doing). But did you know there‚Äôs a corollary to the friendzone ‚Äì one that applies to girls?

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, *The Fuckbin*.

The Fuckbin can be defined as:

**A place where a girl is relegated to sex-only, and nothing more. The guy she‚Äôs having sex with doesn‚Äôt want a relationship or any sort of real intimacy with her.**

In the same way guys try to escape from The Friendzone, a girl who‚Äôs in The Fuckbin often doesn‚Äôt want to be there‚Ä¶ despite her actions only reinforcing her position there. We all know a member of The Fuckbin when we see one ‚Äì they‚Äôre easy to spot. There‚Äôs a tonne of things girls can do to secure their presence in The Fuckbin , including:

* Bragging about how many other guys she‚Äôs slept with (a high lay-count is not an achievement for a girl; it takes zero effort for a girl to get laid). Bragging about something that took you no effort to achieve is a turn-off. Note: having a high lay count is not something I care about; she can do whatever she wants with her sex life. But bragging about it is a turn-off.
* Being completely closed off and never opening up to you or being vulnerable in any way, ever.
* She‚Äôs leaving town in a few weeks/months, so you know the relationship isn‚Äôt leading anywhere.
* Being openly dismissive of ‚Äúgirlfriend behaviours‚Äù ‚Äì eg ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never cook for a guy‚Äù, ‚ÄúI hate sleeping over a guy‚Äôs house even if he asks me to‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like public displays of affection‚Äù.
* She‚Äôs sleeping with multiple guys (you‚Äôd be ill-advised getting into a relationship with a girl who‚Äôs currently seeing multiple guys; at least wait &amp; see if she wants to break up with the rest of them in order to date you properly).
* Extremely annoying personality ‚Äì you‚Äôll tolerate her in small doses in order to have sex, but you can‚Äôt imagine the idea of having to put up with her in a relationship setting.
* Having an addiction, being crazy, or other serious red flags.
* Being extremely flaky and disorganised; not respecting your time.
* Being a drama queen whose life is a trainwreck.
* Complaining about things you do, and otherwise showing a lack of respect for you.
* You send a ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still on for our date tonight, right?‚Äù text in the morning, and she doesn‚Äôt reply until 10 minutes before the time you were due to meet.
* Complaining endlessly/being an overly negative person/being a drag to be around.
* Extremely low intelligence ‚Äì you don‚Äôt mind it when you‚Äôre just having sex, but you‚Äôd go nuts if you had to have any sort of lengthy conversation with her outside the bedroom.
* Exhibiting some other behaviour which for you is a dealbreaker (this could be anything you personally deem to be something you won‚Äôt put up with). You put up with it in order to have sex with the girl; but you‚Äôd never tolerate her in an actual relationship. An example ‚Äì for me, a sense of humour is a must. If a girl can‚Äôt even laugh at my jokes, I‚Äôll bang her once or twice but I‚Äôd never in a million years spend any time with her outside the bedroom.

All of these behaviours lead to you naturally liking the girl less, being less attached to her, having less respect for her, and being less likely to want things to progress to any sort of serious ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù level. After all, if she hasn‚Äôt earned your respect or made you like her, why on Earth would you bother investing in her?

&amp;#x200B;

# ‚ÄúGet Me Out of Here!‚Äù

Of course, oftentimes girls who are in The Fuckbin do not want to be in The Fuckbin, and will try and make you feel guilty for the fact they‚Äôve put themselves there. It‚Äôs exactly the same as Nice Guys‚Ñ¢ trying to pull themselves out of The Friendzone by guilt-tripping the girl.

There‚Äôs one thing I need to make absolutely clear:

**You have the right to get into a relationship ‚Äì or not get into a relationship ‚Äì with whomever you choose.**

Many girls in The Fuckbin will completely dismiss this fact &amp; often be downright insulted by your right to choose. She wants a relationship; therefore, you need to give it to her, right now.

But rather than *change the behaviours that led to her Fuckbin incarceration*, she‚Äôll double-down on her bad behaviours while simultaneously telling you off for judging her. You should give her a relationship just because she wants it ‚Äì just like the Nice Guy should get a relationship/sex just because he wants it.

If only we could have whatever we want, by simply saying *‚ÄúI want it so give it to me‚Äù*.

There‚Äôs two ways to deal with girls who do this ‚Äì either be honest with her and tell her, ‚ÄúLook, this will only ever be casual‚Äù. Or end things with her, because her nagging/emotional manipulation is only going to get worse as time goes on. **There‚Äôs no point seeing a girl who‚Äôs not happy seeing you.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Girls Who Willingly Reside in The Fuckbin

Some girls actually put themselves in The Fuckbin intentionally. A mate of mine has been casually seeing this girl recently who has very, very, very low self-esteem and is always making self-deprecating statements about herself. Because her self-esteem is so low, she‚Äôs convinced he‚Äôs too good for her, and she‚Äôs always making ‚Äújokes‚Äù like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to replace me with a better girl, right?‚Äù and ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt get feelings for me or want anything serious because I‚Äôll probably just disappoint you.‚Äù

By saying these things, and constantly trying to keep things casual-only, she‚Äôs keeping herself in The Fuckbin. Even if my mate *wanted* something more with her, she‚Äôs made that completely impossible with her constant self-deprecation and sabotaging of any kind of intimacy.

&amp;#x200B;

# Is The Fuckbin Good or Bad?

Truth be told, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with girls who are in The Fuckbin. It‚Äôs their life; they can do whatever they choose. Ask any guy who gets laid regularly, and he‚Äôll tell you girls in The Fuckbin make life a whole lot easier when you‚Äôre trying to have sex. In fact:

‚ÄúGod Bless Fuckbin Girls.‚Äù

‚Äì Andy, 2019

I mean check out this girl‚Äôs Tinder bio:

‚ÄúNot here for anything serious‚Äù. I love girls who call out to you from The Fuckbin right in their Tinder bio.

I matched with her and immediately thanked the heavens for sending me this gift on a silver platter. I banged her on the first date, &amp; ended up banging her 2 more times after that. God bless the low-hanging fruit.

All silliness aside, I really love girls like this because they‚Äôre 100% upfront and honest and don‚Äôt play games. She‚Äôs self-aware and honest enough to know what she wants.

The only issue can arise when after a few weeks/months of banging, some of these girls hit you with the ‚ÄúWhere is this going? What are we? Do you only want me for sex?‚Äù nonsense. I‚Äôve written about my thoughts on [how to handle this exact situation](https://killyourinnerloser.com/how-to-handle-what-are-we/). When a girl says this, it‚Äôs just like a Nice Guy saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been friends for years now, when are we going to become something more?‚Äù

# Girls Earning Their Way Out of The Fuckbin

Miracles do happen. Some girls earn their way out of The Fuckbin ‚Äì by pulling off a massive turn-around. Maybe she kicks an unhelpful/addictive behaviour and cleans up her life, or starts sorting out her life and working on goals/achievements. Maybe she starts seeing a counselor and becomes someone worthy of respect. Maybe she starts cooking and cleaning for you, stops complaining about irrelevant shit &amp; properly tries to earn your affection.

It should be noted this is *extremely* rare (I‚Äôve only ever had ONE girl legitimately earn her way out of The Fuckbin ‚Äì and she‚Äôs currently my main girl). You‚Äôll find most people don‚Äôt change ‚Äì and you should be wary of someone appearing to change in the short term as a manipulation tactic to secure commitment from you. Change has to be over a long enough time scale that you can see it‚Äôs *legitimate change.*

**Don‚Äôt hand a relationship/commitment to a girl just because she asks for it ‚Äì it‚Äôs something she‚Äôs got to** ***legitimately earn from you.***

Execution focus and self evaluation,"A lot of otherwise smart people who understand the importance of improvement place a huge emphasis on learning. They read and read, apparently expecting something to magically click inside of their heads and then they'll become awesome.

I've seen it in guys struggling with the red pill, they read the sidebar and devour content but don't get anywhere with their romantic life. I've seen it in managers, always reading books about leadership and saying the right buzzwords but applying so little of it in their actual work. 

What they lack is execution focus. *Understanding* a concept is by far the smallest part of *doing* something well. Nobody gives a fuck about book smarts. You can know every single relevant thing about making a perfect golf swing and still suck at making shots. That's obvious to everyone, but as soon as we leave the realm of physical skills many people forget that.

To learn how to do stuff well, you have to practice. And that takes time and effort. You do it, again and again, until you get good. That's how you build skill, and building skill is absolutely essential for being able to execute.

This sounds like a nobrainer, but the reality is that a lot of people will read and read, but never take the time to practice and build skill.

If you read a book or watched a youtube video on something you'd like to be able to do, and you can't do it well yet, then ffs don't move on to the next book or video. Make a plan for how you'll practice, and go practice. Again and again. Stop focusing on learning and instead focus on execution and building the necessary skill.

There's been many studies done on how to develop skill. Some basics I won't touch on further is being motivated, finding joy in what you do and take a break before you begin hating it, and visualizing.

What I'm going to focus on here is having a solid self evaluation loop.

Studies in sports have shown that for most people, their skill development is slow and after just 50 hours it drops to almost zero. The people who not just learn things quickly, but more importantly who continue to progress after they got the basics, all have a strong focus on self evalution. 

First, you break it down into smaller parts. There might be 5, 10, 100 different aspects to a skill, and if you try to just ""learn to golf"" there are way too many aspects for you to consciously comprehend and evaluate. The solution is to identify one aspect you want to improve on, ideally the one that will have the largest impact for the time and effort put into it, and work on it. Focus consciously on improving it when you're practicing, and evaluate on how well you did afterwards, and do that as often as possible.

Self evaluation is essential to building skill.

Let's take an example: you want to signal stronger frame. Part of that is to appear more confident, but that's still too broad. You identify that your body language is tense and fidgety. Presenting a relaxing and calm body language, that's something you can work. So you consciously check your posture to ensure that you have a wide and tall stance, that your hands are open and apart, etc. That's a self evaluation and improvement loop you can have running many times a day, and over a few days you'll be able to eliminate some bad habits and work in some good ones. Then you switch to another aspect and repeat the process, run the loop again.

The key parts are actually practicing, ie. doing it, and the self evaluation. A lot of the time, neither of them are fun initially, but find the motivation to do it. Often it does take long before you turn a corner where you begin feeling competent and seeing some progress, and then it becomes fun and easy to do. Take something like talking to strangers to learn approaching and dread game, most guys find it horrible initially, but then it works one time and then another and then they get hooked on it.

How good is this process of execution focus and improvement loops? Imagine a guy who read a book, then went back to the chapter on approaching and every few days picks a new aspect of it, puts in effort to practice it by actually doing it, self evaluating each time and working in improvements. He does that for a few weeks, then picks another chapter on something else and goes out and practices that, self evaluating on one aspect at a time.

How well can that guy execute in 6 months? Pretty damn well. He'll have built real skill, he'll have seen real success, and that'll built real confidence and frame.

Compare that to a guy who instead read 4 books, and along the way he tried to half-ass a few things, found it didn't work too well and instead of practicing he went back to read about something else.

Bottom line is, it's not about what you *know*. It's about what you can *do*. There are way too many red pill aware guys who never went out and did the work needed to become awesome.

Stop the content consumption, stop thinking that if only you knew more you'd get that insight that would make you get it. It's bullshit and doesn't do shit for becoming red, learning to play golf or anything else in life.

Focus on execution. Build skill. Self evaluate. Run the improvement loop, over and over.",6,1
My (17) experience after becoming Red Pilled.,"I'm a 17 year old guy, I've never posted anything in this sub so I hope the tags are right and I'm on my phone so sorry about bad formatting.


I don't befriend every girl or really run behind any but if I make a girl my friend I used to go to any extent to fulfill their wishes and I used to always available for them. They might text me at 3AM and I'd reply inna few seconds. 


Every girl I've befriended and cared for usually replaces me eventually and I used to think that if I am the problem or they are the problem. I lost almost all my self-respect begging a girl not to leave me. After one last incident I was disgusted of myself, I understood that I was the problem, I was always available to them like a fucking dog and I sweared that I am not doing that shit anymore for anyone.


I found Red pill soon after this and after that I started treating myself better than all these women. I started giving them little to no attention like I used to, they started telling me that I've changed (bitch you bet I did!) and now I don't consider them *'friends'* (These people used to use me up and walk all over me) and I hate them.
They said all this shit just because I started giving them no attention and treated them with speciality.


Girls who replaced me started to text me frequently and I gave them the *'you are not special'* treatment and started leaving them on **read** and this prompted them to text even more and I started to become less available.
They tried to get back with me and become friends, I told them they treated me like shit and I don't want nothing to do with them.

Life's been great after Red Pill.


I'd like to thank all the older gentleman of this sub for giving great advices. I hope you drop some more advice for a young Red pill like me in the comments.",114,1
The fire within,"7 months ago I was at a turning point in life, overweight (by my standards), depressed, in a bad relationship, and going no where real quick. These past few months have been some of the best months of my life, the flame that once burned returned with a vengeance. Not a temporary flicker either. I‚Äôll share with you what helped me, so that it may help you.

1. You are where you are in life because of your own decisions, the sooner you stop blaming other people for the shitty things in your life, the sooner you can get out of the hole you‚Äôre in. TAKE OWNERSHIP OF YOUR LIFE, regardless of ANY surrounding circumstance. It may not be your fault, but it is your responsibility (how you choose to RESPOND to crappy things is also your responsibility)

2. Find your ‚ÄúWHY?‚Äù. Life itself entails suffering, to survive and thrive, you must have a reason to fight. Find what you are willing to LIVE for. Jordan Peterson describes this as ‚Äúorienting yourself towards the highest good you can think of and going towards it‚Äù.

3. Actions matter, thoughts do not. You may think all sorts of crazy, depressing, self depreciating shit. Your thoughts do not define you, your actions do. Believe it or not, actions influence thoughts not the other way around.  If you wait until you FEEL good to act, you will never achieve what you want. You can‚Äôt control your thoughts 

I could preach some more but I‚Äôll cut it there. As it relates to the Red Pill, many of us are waking up to realize that healthy relationships are a byproduct of a healthy mind, focused on self improvement, responsibility, and right action. If you want your life to change, start taking action. Read books, google shit, FIND the solutions to YOUR problems. I‚Äôd suggest the following books to start

A girl's boundary is based on you not her,"Met this girl. We clicked. I rarely gave her any attention, because I didn't care about her. When I made moves and she acted hard to get i just did my own things and backed off. 

Fast forward she let's me take her virginity, begs me to come in her and when I say no many times she actually says yes to anal given that I 'fill her up'-  although she previously said that she finds ass play absolutely disgusting. 

Fast forward a bit more, I call things off. She goes on a date, met guy. He makes a move on her, she let's him down. He doesn't take the hint, and keeps pushing but overtly: begging her saying they're close and they should have fun. She let's him- due to shock, or post-hookup clearance idk. 

Now she sent a text fucking him up, is having him reprimanded in university and brining this up to the administration since they met on campus. 

Shes claiming sexual assault and that he crossed her boundries by kissing her and feeling her tits, and that shes not that type of girl. 

Same girl, 3 weeks ago was begging me to cum in her ass, and was begging me to throat fuck her. 

Ofcourse, I cant call her out on her BS. Also, ofcourse her hamster spun things and it's ok for her to be this way with me because we are 'intimate' 

Since I cant call her out, and I wont get involved or help the poor guy on the other end of this story. I'm telling you guys

1) in this age, a not excited yes is a no. It's true that TRP advocates making bold moves, but such moves should be bold and covert. Furthermore, if met with resistance take a step back and see if you want to try again also covertly. NEVER beg and never overtly state. Also sometimes trying again isnt worth the hassle. An excited yes is better than a hopeful maybe. 

2)  my story is in a 3rd world country where 'rape culture' isnt as dominant. So the advice of 'always text her acknowledging you had a good time' is valid and I'm guessing doubly valid in other countries. 

3) most female boundaries are not based on principle. Many, especially the sexual ones, are based on her view of you, your SMV, and how much she wants you to stay.",121,1

How To Cure Negativity,"# Negativity Is The Default

The sad truth about humanity is most of us carry negative thoughts and emotions throughout our days, months, years, and lifetimes. Sure we might experience a few thrills and excitement but not nearly enough. There are studies revealing numbers like 80% of our thoughts are negative - 95% of those are repetitive. This basically puts most of us in the **anxiety disorder** bracket. **That‚Äôs pretty serious if you ask me**.

From personal experience, I know I used to carry around small amounts of anxiety concerning even the most mundane things; did I buy enough groceries, how are tomorrow's tasks going to be done, I need to clean the apartment, etc. These few examples of the smallest things can be a mild anxious experience - yet we regard these negative impulses as the norm.

# The Collective Trap

Most folks experience social anxiety even at an older age. You know that small feeling of dread right before you enter an apartment where there‚Äôs a pre-party. There are new co-workers at your job you need to cooperate with. You start to ask yourself if they will like you. If you are enough. The need to get the group‚Äôs acceptance creeps up in your thoughts and feelings like a virus - often at a lightning speed. We are so accustomed to it we take it as a given.

The most bizarre thing about this mentality is that we don‚Äôt even know if these new people are even worth your attention and energy. They might be low-value personalities. The truth is most people you will meet are completely average. Not some royalty on a red carpet.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;‚ÄúSome people are in such utter darkness that they will burn you just to see a light. Try not to take it personally.‚Äù - Kamand Kojouri

&amp;#x200B;

If you don‚Äôt show any fear or insecurity in social spaces such as work and leisure - **some people might envy your confidence even try to cut you down**. You will meet personalities who live and die with the group. There‚Äôs a phenomenon called ‚Äú**Tall-Poppy-Syndrome**.‚Äù It‚Äôs a tendency to discredit individuals who have achieved high status and moved up a station in life.

The truth is there are many personalities out there with low self-esteem which in turn generates jealousy and envy. You need to cultivate a rock-solid inner world and get used to navigating all social aspects in life. **Don‚Äôt take on the mind virus of the tribe**.

# Social Media and Entertainment

Social media is a negative element in our modern lives. **Facebook, Twitter, and to some degree Instagram - has turned into a political landscape**. We love to engage in thrilling debates, to push our own opinion, to win an argument. To find peers with whom we share views and ideas. **From what I‚Äôve seen - in the end, its all just a waste of time and energy**. It‚Äôs no secret that these platforms are designed to get us hooked. I personally use Instagram for inspiration and art.

The industry of video games is a billion-dollar industry and is only growing. There is a number of grown men participating in gaming. 50-year-old gamers, can you imagine that? That‚Äôs our reality. When I grew up in the 90s you wouldn‚Äôt find a man in their late 20‚Äôs spending time in front of the Super Nintendo. Its an indication of how good the creators have become at getting us hooked.

The highest-ranking video games are the ones with the most violence and murder. In other words - the most negative ones, the ones with the most thrilling ups and downs. We should be cultivating positivity, how we can contribute value, mentor, and help one another. Not how to kill.

# The Battle For Your Attention

We live in the information age - with that there are new obstacles we have to overcome. That is if you want to escape mediocrity. **Most people are hit with 6,000-10,000 ads each day**. The majority through handheld devices and computers. **If you have read books on marketing you will find there are techniques employed to work on your ego and insecurities**. On your feelings of lack and self-worth, not measuring up. Keeping up with the Joneses - and all that other bullshit.

Marketing strategies are designed to both create and feed off of negative thoughts and feelings. If the ads are considered any good they will have you realize there are things you didn‚Äôt know you wanted but want now. **Ads are designed to continuously mold you into being a consumer, and keeping it that way**. You will see these kinds of ads on your average YouTube influencer too.

# Energy Drain

What we dont hear often is the energy drain negativity causes; especially emotional energy. **I keep remembering how a friend of mine talked about how his mom looked like she aged 10 years in just a few weeks** \- because she was in court over a money dispute with her ex-husband. If you have ever worked in sales you will have experienced the constant burning of emotional energy leaving you too tired to do anything else after a days work.

The constant worrying and anxious states deplete the body of energy. The energy we could channel into productivity, energy which could be used to realize our dreams.

# Self Esteem

Again we see the Pareto's law in action. It is estimated 85% of the population suffers from low self-esteem. **People with low self-esteem are said to be driven by fear and anxiety**. Have difficulty setting goals for themselves, and if they set goals they are drastically lowered to fit their expectations of what they deserve in life. The goals being set are usually familiar and undemanding. **Low self-esteem can even cause us to sabotage our own achievements in the longterm - this is subconscious**.

**High self-esteem individuals are driven by positive impulses, with a need to explore and challenge themselves**. They usually set goals that require them to grow as human beings - goals that will make them evolve in life. **The goals are driven by excitement and exploration, not the need to prove their self-worth to themselves or others**.

# Filling Your Mind

Our minds need nourishment too. But the average joe often fills it with junk food. TV, maybe a few hours in front of the computer or his phone. Reading mindless articles designed to entertain and keep attention rather than provide you with anything worthy of thought. Want to live your life in mediocrity? Then do what most of the population does. Want to become exceptional? **Then do what most won‚Äôt**.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;‚ÄúIf you dont program yourself - life will program you‚Äù - Les Brown

&amp;#x200B;

The single most important thing I have ever done in life is becoming an avid reader, over the months and years of reading non-fiction books your outlook and mind will slowly start to change. You will separate yourself from the herd. **You will start to cultivate positive thoughts - become inspired**. Reading good books will allow you to have the courage to dream big and actually push you to take steps towards your dreams. **Biographies will reveal that we are all cut from the same cloth**. **What one man can do you can do**. These are cliches but nevertheless the truth.I truly believe that input will determine the output. Start by filling your mind with positive suggestions and reinforcement every day.If you are not used to reading books - set a timer for say 15 minutes of reading in your bed at night. Work yourself up to 1 hour a day. You will not regret it.

# Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs Transformation

Mr.Franklin achieved a lot in his life. But it's not his public victories which should impress you, it's his dedication to self-improvement. I have stressed the importance of reading - **well to no surprise he was an avid reader**. What's more interesting if you ask me is that he dedicated himself to transform his qualities as a man. He dedicated himself to develop 13 virtues. 

He carried cards with him and focused on developing one virtue for one week at a time. Every time he failed practicing the chosen quality he would note it down in his ledger. He is not the only one which dedicated himself to *moral perfection* as he called it. The Samurai had their bushido code. Aristotle had his 12 virtues which he practiced. This practice you don't see that often today.

# Old Habits Die Easy

&gt;‚ÄúLearn to subdue, to purify, to order all your thoughts. Fight against all negative thoughts and doubts. Let sublime thoughts come to you from every side. Thoughts of depression, failure, weakness, darkness, doubts, fear etc. are negative thoughts. Cultivate positive thoughts of strength, courage, love, contentment and cheerfulness. The negative thoughts will disappear. ‚Äú - Swami Sivananda

You will simply replace negative emotions with positive ones. This is a daily endeavour, but will slowly change your personality and self-image. **All you have to do is ignore negative impulses, do not engage in worry or anxiety about anything**. Even the slightest thing. Over time their intensity will diminish. The Next step is to replace negatives with positives. Examples could be - will they think i'm awkward or weird? **I am a great person to be around**. Am I coming off as creepy? **They should be thrilled to get to know me**. How am I going to perform today at work? Everything will take care of itself, just do one task at a time. Am I behind on my bills? **I have always made it so far, this too will work itself out**.

This approach is so simple, it will spread like a positive virus in you,  and will start to transform your character. You will start to catch attitudes and behaviors you didnt think you had. Realize we all carry a lot of beliefs and values that are not really our own to begin with. They have come from peers and family members. You know the saying - you are the average of the 5 people you hang around with. It is true - so maybe have a look around you to see if you are dealing with negative personalities that you don't need in life. If this approach seems too basic you could have a look at Neuro-Linguistic-Programming which contains strategies to change your inner world.

We have become a narcissistic society, many of us carry around huge ego about our personalities, success, and achievements. **My advice to you is to not take yourself or anything in your life too seriously. Do not let anything in life disturb your inner state. Practice detachment**. Work towards your goals and dreams - but know that it might take several tries and a ton of failures before they are realized. Do not attach your inner world to any outcome in life. **Master this and you are above the average**.

# What You Think Is What You Become

Visualization is a common practice among star athletes, but its origins are ancient. It is a common practice in eastern philosophy. Here is how to do it - imagine yourself in the first person as already have achieved the outcome you seek in life. It is mostly used by dreamers who want materialistic things in life, such as a sports car, or a big mansion.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;‚ÄúSow a thought, you reap an action. Sow an action, you reap a habit. Sow a habit, you reap a character. Sow a character, you reap a destiny.‚Äù ‚Äì Swami Sivananda

&amp;#x200B;

What you dont see that often is that it can be used to transform yourself. Set of a few minutes every day to visualize yourself with the attributes you wish to have. Healthy, confident, funny, strong, powerful, you name it. Visualize it - and in time it will be so.

# Conclusion

What I made this post here for is to expand on it a little bit. 

When we first hear about it, learn about, we most likely have a set of beliefs about how women work ingrained in us already.  Maybe it was force fed to us by our peers, maybe we watched too many Disney movies as a kid.  Whatever the reason, you'll probably be depressed, angry, sad, etc.

But through all that, the seed of the idea is planted.  You hopefully keep an open mind and over a little time, think about your past experiences, what your family/friends have gone through in their relationships with women, and think ""Hey, maybe there is something to this.  Maybe this makes sense.""

You accept it more, but then what do you do with this information?  

The facts are the facts, Hypergamy is real and it is something women do, in order to survive and procreate.  Nothing personal, they have to live their lives.  But you also have to live YOURS.  So what does this mean for you?

Men want sex and women want commitment (from a man who demonstrates high value, albeit).  However it seems when we focus on pursuing sex with a women, more often than not, you hear stories of how pursuing it is seen as ""low value.""  This is the case when a man is low value himself and makes sex the focus.

Instead, he needs to make himself the focus.  Women don't want to win, they want a winner.  They WANT you to succeed, they just test you (shit test, comfort test) to make sure you ARE that guy deep down.  

This is where understanding Hypergamy and the role it plays in a man and woman's life is so crucial.  It is essentially a feedback loop where if you work hard to improve yourself and subsequently demonstrate high value, she will see that and (hopefully) perceive you as a high value male, thus making Hypergamy work FOR you.

If you were low value previously (and she knew this), she will test you left and right to see if this is who you really are now.  

Things like sex, success, respect, admiration, etc, are the BYPRODUCTS of a life of HIGH VALUE.  They are NOT THE FOCUS.  

Your focus must be your mission/vision.  If you don't have one, establish it.  What do you want out of life?  How will you get there?  

You are the driver in the car of your life.  Your woman is a passenger.  She hopped in your ride because initially she saw you going somewhere in life but along the way, you made her your focus and took your eyes off the road.  This is where she may have gotten out of your car and hopped into someone else's.  Also, don't ever make her the driver, else you'll crash into a tree.

Remember that she isn't the prize, YOU are.  Live your life with value, push yourself, get out of your comfort zone, and grow.  That is how you will make Hypergamy work in your favor.",52,1

Accepting that Love is different for Women,"First time posting. If I'm breaking any rules I'd be happy to change/edit to fit it in. Also, not my idea, but I was inspired to summarize it here- 

Men, boys, teenagers we have and are being systematically taught to NOT see the cold hard fact; women cannot love us men the way we men want them to love us. This topic has been talked about plenty of times, so im not going to preach to the choir. 

Instead, I want to share my struggles about the ""acceptance"" aspect of this fact... the denial, the frustration, the depression, the flip flop back and forth and finally getting to acceptance and beyond. Id also like some men to post about their experiences in replies below, maybe a ""field report"" I think its called. 

Its a very hard pill to swallow and one by which the change it not immediate. I can honestly say without a doubt i have fully accepted this truth rationally. However, on the same token of honesty, I have not purged the absolute desire for women to love me the way I want them too. On one hand my brain knows, on the other my emotional conditioning refuses to let go. So, what am I doing?... 

I'm constantly practicing, listening too, and reaffirming to myself red pill to keep my red pill habits up to snuff. Its a process, just like incorporating healthy eating habits or exercise you gotta keep working at it to maintain. Red pill is not a destination but a decision to live ones life in a better way, a healthier way. 

I can see now, not just feel, that I'm having less and less desire for the old way I wanted them to love me.

How do you guys cold approach women during COVID-19 since everyone has masks on inside?,"For so long I have wanted to get out there and start approaching women to get laid since I am still a virgin at 22, but although I do have the self confidence to do it, I don't know where to go right now, and I don't know if it's even doable or where I should go if it is.  
I tried the online dating thing on Tinder and other dating apps but had no success at all, I would get only 2 tinder likes per day and they never replied to my texts, that is because I am too skinny for Tinder but last semester, before the quarantine, I had 2 hot 18 year old women who were 8/10 who were checking me out but I missed those opportunities because I didn't actually know what I want.  


The only productive thing that I do right now is lifting heavy weights 3 times per week in the gym and gaining strength and muscle mass to get my best physique yet in order to be able to succeed on Tinder since I know that my body is the only thing that is stopping me from succeeding on Tinder.  


In the meantime though, I need alternatives to online dating, I am willing to cold approach of course but I need to know where I can go during the pandemic.  
Because of COVID-19, everyone has to wear masks inside so what are the best places to approach women during this pandemic?   


I want to meet young women but I don't know where to go to do so since all my classes are now online and all the social events in my area were cancelled, bars are still open but only on places where you are sitting down, of course you can take your mask off when sitting down though but you have to put it back on every time you move.   


I don't want to use excuses for doing nothing though, if you guys could give me good examples of places I can go to meet women, I would really appreciate that because right now, I have a lot of free time to do this but I waste it on online forums instead of taking actions because the social distancing stuff has made me feel powerless since I don't know what to do to get what I want, I don't want to spend another year or another couple of months without talking to women.",14,1

Discussion/Question/Stumped about something in Rollo's RBG Podcast,"Podcast referenced [here](https://youtu.be/PojKphVK-LY)
Rollo says that the advantages given to women will only be taken back by force (2:01), but also mentions that men should run for office and get involved in politics to turn back the tide(2:54)... It seems that these two cannot coexist. There is no way in today's climate that any of the policies to re-equalibriate the gender dynamic will pass, and the only way women will give them up is either through a destabilizing event or by force, so choices for us are really either take one for the team and become a terrorist with a nuke or enjoy the decline and do our best to not participate in ways that the other sex wants us to, no responsibility without authority... However with the way he says the sisterhood works and the prevalence of feminist socialism, it seems like we may be headed for a future where you have no choice but to take the responsibility and provide resources as they will use the government as the wealth redistributor. The only other way I see is to use the Atlas Shrugged tactic, which is not to play, so we don't pay into the system, which he disapproves as nihilistic, but his suggestions will not result in the re-balancing that he argues for. Short of inventing an artificial womb, there is really not much we CAN do that will have an impact, so what should we do?",14,1

Day 1 on ‚Äúred pill‚Äù,"I‚Äôm in a 9 year relationship and sex has dwindled over the years. Definitely realized why. I‚Äôm a beta. Anyways not really trying to refer to myself as that term but I guess that‚Äôs the term here.

I read a little on the sidebar. Some quotes that stuck with me:

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt negotiate attraction.‚Äù
I would always try to communicate about sex, which never helped. She just isn‚Äôt as attracted to me as I imagined her or imagine her ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to be.

‚ÄúNo one will love you like your mom did‚Äù
Yup me like a lot of people want mother‚Äôs love. I constantly just fantasize about random girls giving me a back massage, and cuddles without sex. That‚Äôs how bad I‚Äôm craving affection... 

It‚Äôs shown me how moving in together is a bad idea because you become so familiar with each other and familiarity loses attraction.


Anyway. I also have to say I don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúhate‚Äù for women I see. Which is why I can‚Äôt go full red pill. Even though I know not everyone here is like that, but it seems to be the male version of feminist (unsure the word for that). I don‚Äôt think all feminists hate men either. But both sides seem to think their own gender is superior in a way. Isn‚Äôt there an even split where we‚Äôre both fucked up in our own ways? Idk maybe I haven‚Äôt read enough, this is just at first glance.

It‚Äôs not my goal to break up with said gf and just fuck random girls.

But I did realize I am a joke to what females want biologically, I‚Äôm just not a ‚Äúman‚Äù I am way to feminine.

But yeah it definitely showed me I need to stop being a bitch and hope for comfort and affection like a little kid. I need to not give a fuck and work on myself because those days are long over.

It showed me that my relationship/lack of sex is my fucking LAST priority and I‚Äôm gonna go full monk mode no porn and start reading/going to gym/ and diving into hobbies more. Life will fall into place once I am creating a better version of myself even if that means the relationship ends",114,1

Direct Game Versus Indirect Game,"I walk up to a cute blonde girl at the bar and say, ‚ÄúHey, would you like to have sex?‚Äù
She responds¬≠, ‚ÄúWell, I don't really know you. What‚Äôs your name?‚Äù
We talk for over an hour at the bar until she says, ‚ÄúHey, would you like to get a drink back at my place?‚Äù
I used the most direct pickup line imaginable, and it worked.

Of course, the other 50 times I asked women to have sex with me right off the open, it didn‚Äôt go quite so well.

1 out of 50 isn‚Äôt that bad ‚Äì you could easily approach that many women in a single weekend. But, it goes without saying that you‚Äôd have a better ‚Äòbatting average‚Äô if you used an indirect opener like, ‚ÄúHey, do I look like a drug dealer?‚Äù

Asking, ‚ÄúWould you like to have sex?‚Äù Is an exaggeration of what direct game really looks like, but it does show that direct game can work.

The million-dollar question, though, is whether direct game is more effective than indirect game.

I‚Äôve heavily experimented with both types of game, and I have a satisfying answer to the question, ‚ÄúWhich is better, direct game or indirect game?‚Äù

&amp;nbsp;

##Direct Game: The Advantages

&amp;nbsp;

In dating, women rarely make the first move. So, you will miss countless opportunities unless you lead your interactions with women towards something sexual.

For example, when I was 19, I brought a beautiful girl into my bedroom for the first time. She gave me a sensual full-body massage.

Obviously, she wanted me to fuck her. But I was so afraid of rejection that I didn‚Äôt make a move. The next morning, she said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I was expecting to happen.‚Äù I never saw her again.

If I had been direct in my interest with that girl, we absolutely would have had sex. That‚Äôs the advantage to using direct game: when a girl does like you, you will make something happen.

Truth is, most men miss countless opportunities with women simply because they never make a bold move.

The basic strategy behind direct game is to let the girl know that you are attracted to her (I.E. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very attractive.‚Äù If she reciprocates your interest, you‚Äôve both consciously agreed that the nature of your relationship is sexual.

Direct game will instantly weed out the girls who aren‚Äôt interested in you. But in many cases, nothing was going to happen with them anyway, so you‚Äôre just saving time.

A certain percentage of the women you meet will have a strong natural attraction for you. Being direct with these women can be an effective, no-bullshit dating strategy.

I wish I had understood the merits of direct game in my teens. I missed dozens (if not hundreds) of opportunities with women because I just didn‚Äôt make my interest clear.

&amp;nbsp;

##The Disadvantages of Direct Game

&amp;nbsp;

Direct game works well on ‚Äúyes girls‚Äù (women who have consciously decided they‚Äôre attracted to you), and it saves time with ‚Äúno girls‚Äù (women who have consciously decided they‚Äôre not interested in you).

But, there is a problem with direct game ‚Äì it forces women to make a snap decision about you. Many women will be fence sitters at first: they‚Äôre not sure if they‚Äôre interested in you (these are also known as ‚Äúmaybe girls‚Äù).

If a girl isn‚Äôt sure whether she likes you, and you are direct with her, she‚Äôs most likely going to reject you ‚Äì because that‚Äôs the safer option.

Direct game will help you capitalize on opportunities with ‚Äúyes girls‚Äù, but it will also cause you to miss opportunities with ‚Äúmaybe girls‚Äù.

&amp;nbsp;

##The Pros and Cons of Indirect Game

&amp;nbsp;

Indirect game allows you to fly ‚Äúunder the radar‚Äù because you‚Äôre leaving room for the girl to doubt whether you‚Äôre interested in her.

Using indirect game allows you to cultivate attraction with women who at first have a lukewarm response to you. Once a ‚Äúmaybe girl‚Äù realizes your funny, confident, and charismatic, she‚Äôs going to become a ‚Äúyes girl‚Äù.

Most of the beautiful women you meet are going to be ‚Äúno girls‚Äù or ‚Äúmaybe girls‚Äù. Indirect game gives you the opportunity to date some of those women.

Indirect game also has an emotional appeal because it allows you to avoid rejection. If you tell a girl, ‚ÄúHey, I think you‚Äôre beautiful, would you like to get coffee sometime?‚Äù She might reject you bluntly, (I.E. ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm not interested.‚Äù)

Whereas, if you approached her indirectly, she would have no reason to reject you. She‚Äôll eventually say something like, ‚ÄúOh, I have to go find my friends.‚Äù But that doesn‚Äôt have the same sting as the rejections you‚Äôll get when you‚Äôre direct.

Ultimately though, rejection is unavoidable, and the best way to deal with it is to expose yourself to rejection until you become numb to it. One of the disadvantages of indirect game is that it doesn‚Äôt teach you to face rejection head on.

&amp;nbsp;

##The Verdict: Direct Game Vs. Indirect Game

&amp;nbsp;

Direct game is a useful tool for getting some experience under your belt. If you‚Äôre an aspiring Casanova, direct game can help you make the most of your opportunities with ‚Äúyes girls‚Äù.

Hypothetically, though, you can attract more women with indirect game, but to pull that off you must be comfortable with escalating your interactions sexually. For most guys that‚Äôs hard, making a move puts us in a vulnerable position. So, even when we think a girl likes us, we tend to play it safe (and ultimately, nothing happens with her).

Direct game can teach you to stop playing it safe, to take your interactions with women as far as they can possibly go. Yes, most women will reject you when you use direct game, but not all women will. And the women who respond positively to direct game will help you become confident in your sexuality.

Once you‚Äôve gotten some success with direct game (I.E. you‚Äôve hooked up with a few girls), then, you can learn indirect game so that you can start attracting ‚Äúmaybe girls‚Äù.

But if you try indirect game before you‚Äôre good at being direct, it‚Äôs very likely that you‚Äôre going to miss many opportunities with ‚Äúyes girls‚Äù (I speak from experience).

If you‚Äôre a guy who gets nervous about leaning in to kiss a girl for the first time, or you have trouble escalating sexually when you‚Äôre alone with a girl, or you‚Äôre a guy who ends up in the ‚Äòfriend zone‚Äô with women ‚Äì then you should learn direct game, first.

Once you‚Äôre comfortable with being direct, then, you can benefit from learning and practicing indirect game.

Put simply, direct game is the best tool for learning how to attract women when you‚Äôre inexperienced. But indirect game is the best way to attract women when you‚Äôve had a decent number of successes with women in the past.",73,1

You have to start somewhere . . . Working out . . . why it's So important," You've gotta start somewhere if you want the kind of body You like/want. Like women want too! 

  I thought this short video would get a few of you to think twice about \*just how much You Are Trying\* to improve your physical wellbeing -  \[check this guys out - be patient and listen to what he says during it 

for IMHO this guy is more 'alpha' than most guys here 'think \*they are\*' as he's DOING it. There's no shortage of ""cheap words"" in this world. Esp ""tomorrow"" .

 I'm in my 50's and most people think I'm in my early 40's ... sweet üòé and I want to talk about 'muscle memory' . . . as your muscles DO 'remember' their peak periods

ALL I did was to maintain the body I had 'built' at school and up to around 20yo, by which time I was as 'fit' as one can be, I was as physically strong as anyone my size (5'11""/178cms and \~170lbs/75kgs)

 I loved sports but I hated 'exercising' e.g. lifting etc. Alas, as part of my sports training, such things were inevitable but in hindsight I am SO glad I was a physically active kid, as it's Paid Off Big time as I got older And on the occasions I was injured, my recoveries were as good as they got.

  i.e. I nearly killed myself doing 1km as fast as possible on on of those exercise bikes with the 'fan blades' on the spokes that get harder the faster you go? I did a Km in 52 secs and then my knees wouldn't hold me up as I tried to walk away from it. For the whole afternoon my knees were giving out!

  After school, I took a few years off and  at 19yo, I got a job as a bricklayers laborer ... fark! Talk about HARD WORK!  But that job ""built my body into a strong man's body"" during my 18th and 19th yrs

  At first I could put 26 8lb bricks in a barrow and take them \~30mts before my left hand would begin to 'let go' - I just didn't have the strength, even though I was a fit young guy out of school. By the time I finished I could put about 60 bricks in a barrow and run in over planks and through sand and my hands simple Would Not give out! 

 We used to play a game, 'how many bricks lying side by side can you pick up at once?"" Most people would be lucky to do 3-4, we'd be doing 10-12 (before it wasn't possible to 'hold them together' and the middle would collapse) 

 Yet,  It was this work that ""chiseled my body' into the form it ""remembers""  . I had a body like a 75kg Ninja warrior) Not huge, but Very Strong! And the women loved it.

 Now ... and it's the shape my body will return to, given the chance.  Had I never 'created that body"" in the beginning, from LOTS of Hard work and dynamic activities ... sex anyone?  

  And by the end of the year I was Ripped AF, &lt;10% BF and 75kgs of Pure Muscle . . . and I liked it, as did the girls. I liked it SO much \*I kept on doing it\* and my 'muscle memory' IS one where they are 'strong and fit'.

My point is that,  what is called ""homeostasis"" in medicine = what your body 'remembers' the 'best you' to Be! - BUT, it's up to You to become that person Before you 'stop growing' physically. It's NOT something you can 'create later' -- if you haven't ""built your body by 25yo"" it's going to be Much harder

 After all, it, your body,  Knows 'how you are meant to be' as it has ""all the instructions"" in your DNA, and Unless you fail to 'support it' by eating shit and doing SFA 'exercise' - i.e. a walk to Maccas = exercise  NOT!

  IT's VIP that we 'Don't forget' (OR, more likely, no one tells you until it's too late) that we ""keep growing physically until at least 23-25yo and our ""brains"" are STILL developing until about 28-30yo! Ergo Sum:  Your 'training' hasn't finished 'just becoz' you left school! 

In my honest opinion, (unless you have a \*serious\* disability) being a 'fit, healthy' person is Normal. e.g. go to an 'average Asian country' and see how many 'fat people' there. You won't see many. Why?

 Mainly it's due to One word, DIET.  **You ARE WHAT YOU EAT .... Literally.**

  It's only because many people are lazy and life has become 'easy', so, \*they don''t bother\* about their diet, and eat shit called 'fast food', BUT they sure do bitch about their weight/unhealthy state etc when it begins to affect them!

VIP When I was about 19yo, a guy I respected a lot,  'suggested' I 'TRY being a vegetarian for a week. He had just explained a variety of reasons for doing so - - one being that ""bull and elephants and some whales are vegetarians too!"" OK, I would give it a go

  And so,  as I happened to ride by this wonderful vegetarian eatery on my way to photography studies, I'd stop there for lunch and I'd get some vegetarian TA's for dinner. (I was \~21)

A week later, my Mind was Blown!  Aside from the 'extra energy' I seemed to have, I 'felt Light' (i.e. not heavy, lethargic AT ALL!)  And so I became a vegetarian for the next several years. I was 22yo and it was only when I went to live in NZ that I had to break that 'habit' .... I must admit though, that IF I smelled a BBQ it was like my 'ape brain' would kick in and I's start salivating like a hungry derg! Fortunately, I had the strength of will to refuse those (oh so fucking TASTY looking chops!)

  While I am no longer a staunch vegetarian, I have less than 10% ""meat"" in my diet, usually as salami . . .and when summer comes, the odd BBQ'd chop!  Anyway eating meat constipates me badly, it's like I've stuck a cork in my guts ... no bueno!

You ARE WHAT YOU EAT .... Literally. How many of you are probably 20% Maccas and 30%KFC with a 25% pizza component? Me thinks Too many?

&amp;#x200B;

 SO guys, just start with something easy like this, yet MOST Importantly, KEEP IT UP, as this guy DID!

Regardless, as he says, he MADE HIMSELF DO IT EVERY DAY

Objectively....  what I see and hear is that:

1. Men are lonely
2. Men need women for nuture, playfulness, intimacy 
3. Men think there is a game to winning.   If you are lonely and alone...who won
4. Men think women do not want ltr and are programmed for chads.
5. Men think that women have no morals, but describe women as *plates* 
6. Men think there is a game with lines.... frames.... scripts...  For finding a plate or relationship.  Wrong.
7. Men are lonely.  Very lonely 
8. Men can use *plates* but want a devout virgin Madonna for ltr
9. Men are fragile
10. Men have feelings .  They should be treated better. I 100 agree.
11. Men used to be able to pick up women easily, not any more.



When I read the long.....  theories.... I just feel sad. For men.

Like...live your f*cking life organically.   It's not a play. It's the only one you got.

Too many guys are approaching (day/nightgame, online), getting numbers and failing to get girls out on dates.  


This is such a waste.   


A lot of guys are texting women and trying to get them to meet via text.   


Don't text her (this is beta). Find out where she works and plan a surprise visit, ideally on her lunch break.  


Locate her. Approach her from behind, ideally when she's sitting having lunch or doing work. Make sure she can't see you.  


Stand closely behind her and pull your chode out (quietly) and start tapping it against the side of her face. Say ""excuse me"" whilst doing this.  


She'll probably act startled and surprised. This is a shit test. Just be aloof and nonchalant to show her that you are mastering the frame. If she starts protesting your alpha display of dominance then tell her to ""Shut (her) whore mouth"" and press your chode up against her lips to silence her.  


Once you've muzzled her with your dick and have her attention, tell her: ""I love you and I want to take you out. Now. Get your purse. Hurry up. Don't make daddy angry"" - say this while simultaneously slapping her face with your dick.",1,1

Batman Syndrome,"Recently GayLubeOil wrote a post describing the current state of Western Civilization and as expected, autists in the comment section want simple boomer solutions like ""Clean Your Room"" or in this case ""Just work on yourself and civilization will magically fix itself.""

Unfortunately things don't work that way anymore, for some reason the billionaires of the world seem hell bent on destroying Western Civilization and reshaping it into hell on earth. The writing is on the wall and anyone who still wants to label this agenda as a conspiracy theory deserves to get sent to a FEMA camp. 

Conventional solutions don't work anymore, in fact all the conventional solutions have already been tried. We elected President Trump in 2016, we filled The House and The Senate with Republicans and even got majority of judges at The Supreme Court. Despite all of this they have failed to push back and now we are experiencing the wrath of The Left at full force. 

We supported cops whenever they got their shit kicked in by peaceful protesters, and even came up with the cute slogan ""Blue Lives Matter"" just to show them how much we appreciate their hard work. In return they immediately turn on us whenever we dare protest lockdowns to save our small businesses. 

The reason why people still cling to conventional solutions is because they all suffer from Batman Syndrome, in other words they desperately cling to Gotham. 

You see, Gotham is an absolute shithole in every since of the word. Batman constantly has to deal the anarchists like Joker, the nihilists like Mr.Freeze, the selfish materialists like Catwoman and the corrupt Gotham police that sells out to the highest bidder. 

Not only does Batman think he can save Gotham but he also thinks he can reform the villains, and despite failing numerous times he never stops trying. 

Today we see many Westerners suffer from Batman syndrome and that is precisely what is causing their downfall.  

""We need the justice system to respect our Second Amendment"" business owners say as they get jailed for self defense. 

""Women need to start dressing more moderately"" says Abby Shapiro when sluts just wanna keep riding the carousel.

**Conclusion**

If you wanna find solutions get rid of your Batman mentality and stop clinging to Gotham. 

Do people hate you for being white? Pull an Elizabeth Warren and call yourself a Native American or simply move to Japan or Argentina

&amp;#x200B;

If your woman thinks that you Love her, then she starts feeling worthy of you. She starts to feel equal to you, and eventually starts to see herself as above you when you start openly expressing your Love for her and simping out.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the next time your LTR says that she ""Loves you"", then recognise what it really is. It's a female power grab and shit test to break you down. Females are incapable of Love in the way that men percieve it. Female love is all about hypergamy, opportunity and securing the best possible man she can.  


So, the next time your LTR tries to trap you in the ""Love"" venus fly trap of betaization, do this:

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""I Love you""

&amp;#x200B;

You: ""That's cute""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""Do you Love me too????""

&amp;#x200B;

You: ""Hmmm."" \*Long Pause\*............ ""Maybe"" - smirk.

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""OMG, you don't love me do you????""

&amp;#x200B;

You: ""Depends on the day""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""What does that mean????""

&amp;#x200B;

You: ""It means that you're my Number 1 Girl. At least for today""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""OMG! You're such an asshole!""

&amp;#x200B;

You: \*grins\*

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""I hate you so much. You're so mean"" - look of glee on her face 

  
You: \*Wink\* then stare off into space  


Her: ""what are you thinking about?""  


You: \*no response\* Look dreamy  


Her: ""Babe???? What are you thinking about????????""  


You: \*Sit up and look deep into her eyes, maintaining eye contact\*....Pause, and then say to her in a low and dulcet voice.....""Nothing"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Her: \*spppplurrrrrrrrge\* Hamster short-circuits",35,1
"Know Your Worth, Objective measure to be top 20%, Red Pill Perspective","Introduction

Often today it is very common to hear people speak about knowing their worth or ""I know my worth"" as a means to seek self validation, especially for females to cover their insecurities or dissatisfaction or whatever bullshit.  It is simply this BULLSHIT.  However, to see truth worth, red pill has shown us to see the world for what it is.  Objectively speaking many measurements of worth can be determined for men based on a few criteria.  The more easily it is quantifiable, the less subjective. Health and fitness, wealth, and social ability/standing (less quantifiable).  It is important to note, such is a guideline and also an oversimplified roadmap to help one improve one's life and purpose by providing goals and checkpoints.  If the parento distribution of the top 20% of guys get 80% of females play true, how does one become the 20%?  It isn't some immeasurable stat.  But life isn't also about chasing tail but to become the best one can be so that your lifestyle will also reflect it.  When you are in control of your life, you will not be at the mercy of society and its bullshit.  It is then you truly are valuable and know your worth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Health and Fitness

Health and fitness is an very important aspect especially for a red pill man.  Men have long been judged on their physical prowess and it is biologically ingrained in human DNA.  Men are traditionally the protector of females and society.  Without physical strength and vigor, you might as well become a woman.  A lack of health will not only put you at a disadvantage to compete in life but subject to avoidance and ridicule by society.  Sympathy from others may exist if you are really ill but no one would really want to be in your position.  Women value healthy men as well as other men because such is a visceral reaction to a man's worth.  The halo effect is real.

Physical attributes, health and fitness can be broken down into two categories.   Genetic predetermination and environmental and behavioral modifications.  Genetic really is what you inherited from your parents and family.  This includes any ailments and diseases as well as looks, height, race, etc.  Like life, it isn't fair.  Men are not born equal, some will have better genetics than others.  Black pill culture will tell you it is over.  That is an excuse.  For example, one may have been dealt a better hand but it does not guarantee you will win the game.  The river (life) can offer many opportunities for victory.  This is where the second part comes in: Environmental and behavioral. 

Why else is lifting and physical activity so highly preached in red pill circles?  How does one modify or maximize one's genetics?  Changing your body structure.  While you cannot change your height, you can definitely improve your physical ability through training.  The caveat is, to truly have objective assessments of your health, you must record your progress at the gym, get regular medical check ups including blood tests and urine tests.  When you have numbers to work it, you can make adjustments to actually see progress instead of the bullshit, ""I Feel so much better,"" narrative.  

Rigorous discipline is required to ensure improvement.  That is you hold yourself accountable by making a journal to track your numbers.  Your bench, squat, deadlifts over time, running endurance, body fat percentage, weight, all these can be tracked.  Your caloric and water intake.  By keeping good records, you can analyze more objectively where you can improve and how.  You set goals and deadlines for yourself.  For example, I am 15% body fat right now, I want to be at 10% in 6 months.  This is my caloric intake now, how many calories must I drop to achieve this.  Again, I stated previously this is an oversimplification but a rough guideline of how to actually know where you stand against other men of your age.  When you are in your mid 30s, can bench over 150% of your bodyweight, lower than 15% body fat, you are pretty much in the top 10% if not better than the rest of men.  Every morning I wake up early to hit the gym or cardio before I work.  I also hired a strength coach as I got more money to push me properly so I don't get injured.  Do NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP.

Another important measurement of health is mental.  Track your sleep, eliminate unncessary stresses in life.  When you look good, it is natural you will feel better, especially when you surround yourself with other like minded individuals (we will talk about this later).  I acknowledge there are people with legitimate mental illness but one should seek professional help to better this aspect.

&amp;#x200B;

Wealth

Since the beginning of time, anyone with resources are the most powerful.  I am not telling you to be like Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates, however, any man worth his weight will have financial independence or a path towards such.  The rat race is the most blue pilled trap in the history of mankind.  We no longer have too much actual slavery but now slavery is defined by debt such as credit card debt, student loans, etc.  When you have to rely on the government for assistance long term you are pretty much a slave to the government.  The ideology of the white picket fence, marriage and kids is a total pipe dream sold to suckers.  It is to keep you middle class and dependent on society.  When you are rich, you pretty much can avoid all this bullshit.

Real golden rule:  HE WHO HAS THE GOLD, MAKES THE RULES.  The rich always get richer, poor get poorer. Much of it, is due to social conditioning and lack of understanding of how money works.  Most people who complain about money being the root of all evil or all these excuses are poor or incapable.  How to really increase your SMV, increase your net worth.  People who have means will not help those who have nothing to offer, while conversely everyone wants to associate with rich, wealthy or successful people in hopes to be helped to become rich themselves.   (There is no free lunch).

Look at how cancel culture affects businesses and how the world is shaped.  You have to be careful what you post on social media, what you say, etc.  Where is the freedom?  Now imagine, if you have money that renews itself without you needing work (passive), you can just ignore it.

The point of this isn't to become a billionaire per se, but to acheive a point in life where you no longer need to worry about money.  Money affords you time, security, and freedom.  Jack Ma and Bill Gates have stated, by the time you are 35, if you're still poor it is your own fault.  Unless you are born in some 3rd world country with no possibility of social mobility, if born in a developed western nation like USA, you really have no excuse.  

We once again go to objective metrics and stats for improvement.  Finances like caloric intake MUST be tracked and budgeted regardless of your income or earning power.  You can make a million a year but it ain't worth shit if you spend 2 million on useless garbage.  Set a financial road map.  Usually the rule of thumb is to be able to put away cash or sources of cash for an emergency.  Around 1 to 10% of your net worth should be in cash depending on how much you are worth.  I personally like to put away 30-50% into real estate (rental properties, etc), 20-40% in liquid investments (If bear market, I will put more cash reserve, if bull market, I will use more liquid).  Make sure you save for taxes.  These percentages are AFTER TAX percentages but ALWAYS PAY YOURSELF FIRST.  You will see that money really does grow when you take account of it.  Technically your net worth should increase every year.  If it doesn't you need to get a new job or better yourself to get a better career to make capital to invest.  

For university students or those who want to go to university, make sure you actually can get a job or career that will pay well, i.e. STEM fields, doctor, lawyer, etc. as cost of school is ridiculous.  I am a surgeon by profession but I started a business when I was young that took off to pay for school and I did whore myself to rich older Chinese women, being Chinese myself (I speak fluent Chinese and English) and was a pimp later on through connections.   Look it isn't glamorous and I was lucky enough to not get caught.  You really do not want to end up in debt but my passion was the medical field and I was willing to do whatever it took to get there.  Now I work because I love it, not because I have to, but I still budget and do my due diligence. Art of War states, if you do the right calculations you can win 1000 battles before the battle is fought.  Such is the importance of numbers and keeping objective accountability.  I can tell you truly I know ""MY WORTH"" because I can quantify it.  I do not suggest university unless it is your absolute passion because trades save you so much in opportunity costs and investing well makes more money than your day job, whether it is real estate or liquid.  I personally am not smart enough to beat the market so I made sure I hired good accountants and money manager who gives me full disclosure.   I have two portfolios.  One is professionally handled by people I trust, another one is my own as I grew my knowledge in this area through reading books and learning from friends in the industry (again self improvement fellas), to see if I can beat the professionals for fun.   I think investing in index funds for most retail investors is safer than thinking you can outsmart the market by picking stocks.  I have a good portion of my other portfolio that is 70% index funds and a mix of stocks I think will do well.   Again DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP.  See a theme? 

Objective measure: Being in your 30s and 40s and multimillionaire you are pretty much top 5% (if not higher) of men.  

Social Status and support

It is said one's true net worth can determine one's network or vice versa.  This is the least objectively quantifiable as everyone has different definitions of what he wants and values for his friends and network.  You will have useful acquaintances and your ""bros."" and hoes.  After all, you are the average of the 5 closest people to you, so choose wisely.   Having the right friends can make your life easier and also you have people who will help you improve as you also hopefully inspire them to improve. Humans are social creatures and need companionship.  In this realm of life, I find USUALLY men can help men, women are like social leeches.  Yet some females may prove useful as if you do have a group of attractive women, it will draw higher status males and females towards you.  All these measurements of health and wealth with the right social skills, will bring forth higher quality people to your social circle.  As I mentioned before there is no such thing as a free lunch.  To attract high quality people in your life, you must also become high quality yourself.  People love winners.

For example, because I am very muscular and lean, I've met so many well to do people at the gym alone.  People started talking to me and asking me about my routine. I don't discriminate on who I speak with.  At the gym I'm friendly to everyone.  Sometimes I meet some fantastic people who happen to be quite successful in life.  People who are successful will also be able to open up to you more if you are not too shabby either.  Usually, I NEVER tell people what I do for a living.   I usually make something up like I work in an office.  Normal job or I fix broken things, etc.  But for a few that I get closer to , when they tell me they are a land developer or own a business, then I will tell them etc. or if I feel they are a valuable contact.  After meeting a lot of people you develop a sense of feel for people and read people better, not 100% fool proof but pretty good.   I am not telling you to be a snob, but the practice of just talking to random people will help your social skill development to meet great people.  Those who are also well at doing that can see beyond the superficial surface of people and observe actions.  There is a very good chance I can tell a status of a person just by judging their actions and mannerisms not what they look like or wear.  Many old money folks are very unassuming and ordinary from the surface.  There are also folks who might not look successful but have excellent characters.  I value character and personality over what people are or what they have.  But this is up to you, of who you want to bring to your circle.  I also plant a few ""red pill"" seeds to see if this type of person is a type of person who appreciates the red pill.  At this point in life, I need people who might not necessarily be fully red pilled but won't discriminate against it.  Too many blue pilled idiots in the world.  I have found however, typically, successful ""alpha"" type self made men or ambitious men tend to be red pill.  At least the ones who are in my social circle or they are willing to learn.  

I enjoy the company of pretty females and so do my friends, we do pretty well with them whether for one reason or another.  Sometimes though the caveat is, despite all the check points I've listed for self assessment of ""worth,""  gotta be careful of women and their reasons why they hang with you.  Doesn't matter though so long as you are in CONTROL of your life and destiny to an extent and NEVER FORGET your purpose, all that is just noise and annoyances to deal with.  For me, I place a high value on loyalty and honesty among my brothers.  Anyone who betrays this must be removed and purged from the inner circle.  It goes both ways.  I will never back stab my bros.  This is just how I roll, you guys may have different opinions.  The result is I have a group of guys who I know will have my back no matter what.  If I were in danger, needed money (hopefully not), in a dire situation, these guys will support me 100% and I would do the same for them.

Objective measurement:  When you have high value (character) friends who have your back 100% and you theirs, you are doing very well.

Conclusion

To really objectively measure your worth, you have to be honest with yourself and really reflect.  There are a few reference points I provided which allow you to quantify and assess your progress.  Setting goals and deadlines with numerical or tangible values will make it much easier than some subjective bullshit ideology.  Areas that will ultimately help a man maximize his purpose in life include striving for excellence in his health, wealth, and social ability/network.  Why settle to be average when you can become part of the top 20%.  You might not be there now, but as long as you maintain your focus and set honest goals while being accountable to yourself, there is a higher probability you will get there.  Most people in the world are mediocre.  That is why not everyone is rich and successful.  Hopefully this oversimplified guideline will help provide a foundation to a road map for a better life.  The red pill has made me aware of the bullshit that exists in the world, the only way to combat such nonsense is to better myself and rise above the carnage.

You have a choice,"Everyone has legitimate reasons to wallow in self-pity. ""My parents were poor"", ""I'm not that good looking"", ""I have zero friends"" etc. Some people are really born into a better life than you. You could just give up, eat shitty food, watch TV/YouTube etc.

Guess what? Fucking everybody is oppressed in one way or another. Also everybody is an oppressor in some way, eg. you're likely to have more talent in something than most other people. But any of that doesn't matter. You and only you can do something about your miserable and useless life. You have a choice. There are actually  people, with severe medical conditions for example, who can't really do much. I'm willing to bet that you're not among them. It doesn't matter what level of wealth you're going to achieve or how many hot chicks you're going to bang. The only thing that truly matters is the fact that you have this thought all the time in the back of your head, when you wake up, when you go to sleep:

 ""I'm always striving to do the best I can and I always put as much effort as I can.""

Because a man who does his best with the cards he's dealt deserves everyone's admiration and respect, even though all people might not realise it.

These are just a few of the excuses I see guys make for giving up. 

I'm not going into all the specifics, but I will put you guys on to game.

A)SHORT BEARDS AND STUBBLE:

Short beards/stubble can add several points to your facial aesthetics. There have been numerous studies,YouTube videos, polls, and anecdotal experiences in which women are shown to be VERY VERY receptive to a man sporting a groomed short beard or heavy(10 day/4mm) stubble. Short beards/stubble have also, been shown to define your jawline,adding more angularity to round faces(even mine). Short beards/stubble also, make you look more masculine. Try a short beard or stubble. It may just make females ALOT more receptive to you. My 2cents, when I'm clean shaven I get SHITTED on by these females(Savage shit). When I'm heavy stubbled(keep a 4-6mm well groomed stubble) and lined up(cheeklines,neckline) girls see my face and immediately become more open to interacting with me.
Try it!!!!!!!!!

B)LIFT WEIGHTS OR BODYWEIGHT:

lifting weights and calisthenics have both been shown to decrease body fat while increasing muscle mass.
Again many studies,Youtube videos,polls, and anecdotal evidence to show that women are attacted to guys with broad upper body features(shoulders,chest,back,arms) giving a more V-taper appearance. There are several different ways to achieve muscular hypertrophy(muscle breakdown that leads to protein synthesis/muscle growth).
I'm here to point the way,don't be lazy,Google them.
Maybe, just maybe adding some muscle will help you.
Oh yeah...the calories burned and metabolism boost(50 calories burned per 1lb of muscle AT REST) translates to slimmer more chiseled face(facial fat lost) too!!!!!

C)MEWING:

Mewing is what it is,I won't explain it. I'll only tell you that there are studies,YouTube videos,polls, anecdotal evidence,and lots of testimonials about mewing.
Again, Im just putting it out there for guys who think it's hopeless. If you're interested, Google it!!!!!

The Most Important Part Is Just Not Giving Up On Yourself,"We all know it - other guys out there have it way easier than us.

The schism forms between which path a man takes with that knowledge:

Wallow in inebriated agony, drowning in existential depression with alcohol and hypnotic soccer games, or putting themselves through the painful conveyor belt that churns boys into men.

***

I just wonder how many men watch themselves fall into a depressing stupor - they observe themselves descending the Sexual Marketplace with every pleasureful bite of McDonalds - opting for the short term pleasure over the long term victory.

I understand the struggle, and I understand the mentality, it's truly the pinnacle of not giving a fuck:

Becoming the fat, triple chinned reject we all see as the antagonist - because let's face it, the only way you can reach that level of degeneracy is by reaching ‚Äì459.67¬∞F tg (fucks to give).

People use tryhard as an insult - that always aggravated me.

Hardly anything comes easy, and if it does, odds are it's not going to be for you, me, or any other non-top echelon man.

You need to care about your life - obviously you do, that's why you're here. Something was wrong and you couldn't quite put your finger on it. This forum gave you the words.

Those who say it isn't about the pussy are dishonest - it's all about the pussy, but it's through the journey of TRP that one realizes, it isn't everything.

We do all these things to raise our SMV, then by doing so we gain access to pussy, which helps us realize pussy is fun but not everything, then we find more important pursuits and begin to enjoy pussy as a pass time.

But you only get to enjoy pussy as a pass time, once you start to care.

A scuba diver cares about his air, that's why he keeps a vigil eye on his oxygen meter - while the suicidal man cares not for his breath, which is why he lets himself asphyxiate in the running car in his garage.

The man in the car quit.

You wouldn't be here if you wanted the easy way out. You're above being mediocre -- beyond being a normie, who lives a safe and comfortable life sustained by easily attainable yet fleeting pleasures.

You said *""that is not 'the life' for me.""* 

I am with you, brother. We've chosen another life to live.

Men -

*This life* is conflict, struggle, pain, suffering, and competition.

If you wish to live in *this* world, you must fight!

A rising number of men are opting out of this struggle - choosing to taste cold steel on their tongue, feel woven straw &amp; hemp around their necks, or skydive without a parachute.

I don't believe most men zero themselves out in a sudden spur of the moment decision, no those are outliers.

I believe it comes from a man watching his slow descent into the pits of bottom 10% SMV, whilst doing nothing to stop it - then, when he hits rock bottom, he decides he isn't worth the climb back up.

***

When life knocks the rocks out from under your hand, you need to reach back out into the mountain and grab another rock.

If you dangle, you will fall.

The more aware you become, the less tolerant you become to your own apathy.

A man, a red pilled man, fortunately, does not possess the processing power of a woman's hamster - he sees his mistakes, his short comings, his excuses, and he eradicate them through creative action - and he forges himself into a higher man. An ascended man. Ascended above his own destructive and lazy instincts.

***

The dad bods, the soulless NPCs, the dead-eyed joes, the 9-5 slaves... they all had dreams once.

It's painful, it's hard, it's grueling. It's boring, it plateaus, then one forgets the vision that inspired their call to action in the first place.

Imagine that - every loser you meet, they all had dreams once. It wasn't worth it to them - it wasn't worth the effort.

And then they gave up.

***

If you quit on yourself, you lose! You're the only motherfucker who is really on team (insert your name here).

***

That mind of yours, has a power to visualize - and that trusty body, your greatest tool, has a power of action.

One thing that helped me, is I dont think of myself as myself anymore.

My spirit, and my body, are separate entities, and I view my body as a friend to me, my spirit.

If I were to give up on my body, I would be giving up on my best friend, the most trustworthy friend I've ever had, someone who's been there with me through the wins and the loses, since day one.

I can't betray him like that.

I can't betray me like that.

I owe this to him.

I owe it to me.

PSA: Having a higher body fat percentage percentage makes you more effeminate,"PSA: Having a higher body fat percentage percentage makes you more effeminate

Background: I‚Äôve been lurking here for a while and after going through my self improvement journey(which included loosing weight: 25-30% to 10% body fat)I thought I‚Äôd talk about this. 

Now this might surprise you, but a fat slob with 40% BF is not manly. I‚Äôm saying this from a scientific standpoint btw, fat acts as a testosterone inhibiter, more fat=less testosterone(the chemical that makes you a man). Therefore fatter men are effeminate betas. 

There are a lot of studies on this(source at the bottom):

‚ÄúObesity lowers testosterone levels. For example, a 2007 study of 1,667 men ages 40 and above found that each one-point increase in BMI was associated with a 2% decrease in testosterone. In addition, a 2008 study of 1,862 men ages 30 and above found that waist circumference was an even stronger predictor of low testosterone levels than BMI. A four-inch increase in waist size increased a man's odds of having a low testosterone level by 75%; for comparison, 10 years of aging increased the odds by only 36%. All in all, waist circumference was the strongest single predictor of developing symptoms of testosterone deficiency. And if you doubt these two American studies, just consider Australian research that found almost one in every seven obese men could benefit from testosterone replacement, a rate more than four times higher than in nonobese men.‚Äù

Wow, scary stuff, but it also has an impact on your sexuality:

‚ÄúAlthough men with erectile dysfunction (ED) often blame testosterone, hormonal disorders account for only 3% of ED. But even with normal testosterone levels, men who are obese have an increased risk of ED. For example, a Harvard study found that a man with a 42-inch waist is twice as likely to develop the problem as a gent with a 32-inch waist...And a California study reported that having a BMI of 28 (overweight but not obese) increased a man's odds of developing ED by over 90%.‚Äù

I could go on and on, but I think I‚Äôve painted a clear picture. What‚Äôs the solution you ask, simple: Put down the fucking fork and get your lazy fat ass in the gym!!!

I can‚Äôt stress this enough to newbies on here, even if your not fat, lift, men were made to be warriors and hunters, so tap into your nature and go lift some heavy shit.

Now for all the fit guys who are reading this post, I have good news for you. I‚Äôm sure you all have heard of the 80/20 rule, but consider this: 73.4%(7 in 10) of men are overweight, 4 out of those 7 are obese, and around 7% are morbidly obese. If you interpret this, by not being a fat slob you‚Äôre already in the top 25% of men in the looks category. I‚Äôd argue having decent abs puts you in the top 15%, and a V-taper puts you in the top 5%. I base this assumption because there are a lot of weak men who haven‚Äôt lifted a day in their life but aren‚Äôt fat either 

TL:DR Being fat makes you more effeminate, hit the gym.

WTF WHY was my post removed... how is this not redpill,"me n  my friends r gettingwhat we want. good sex for free

the majority of women now are unviable partners. Either fat or so much of a townslut that her pussy turbostanks from all the dickcheese infections and weeks with zero showers.

me and my 2 incel friends got together and we agreed that the only real way for all man to enjoy high-quality woman is to share. So we set it up. We found one super cute virgin 17yo girl (legal in our state) from a local church and us 3 hanged out with her and we fully explained our view to her that the current dating Market has an extreme low supply of high-quality girls. and so we three decided to combine our value and offer it all to one girl and so she can enjoy having three great boyfriends and she can enjoy all three of our resources combined. we explained to her that there's nothing wrong with this and it's totally a viable way for 4 people to be happy. she gets to enjoy the resources of three men instead of one and we will all be super good friends together and enjoy life together

we are now super happy and I suggest more incel men should try this out. but the first step is finding 2 homies that you get along really well

Also we told her we want her to have Chad babies not incel babies so none of us want to get her pregnant. instead we told her we want to find a chad to impregnate her when she wants kids. and she agreed that she prefers having goodlooking kids. Not ugly kids from us. So the issue of pregnancy is solved as well.

Both of my incel friends agree that all we care about is having good sex and a fun relationship. and none of us actually want to spread our ugly genes and force future kids to be born ugly",4,1

We found one super cute virgin 17yo girl (legal in our state) from a local church and us3 hanged out with her and we fully explained our view to her that the current dating Market has an extreme low supply of high-quality girls. and so we three decided to combine our value and offer it all to one girl and so she can enjoy having three great boyfriends and she can enjoy all three of our resources combined. we explained to her that there's nothing wrong with this and it's totally a viable way for 4 people to be happy. she gets to enjoy the resources of three men instead of one and we will all be super good friends together and enjoy life together

we are now super happy and I suggest more incel men should try this out. but the first step is finding 2 homies that you get along really well

Also we told her we want her to have Chad babies not incel babies so none of us want to get her pregnant. instead we told her we want to find a chad to impregnate her when she wants kids. and she agreed that she prefers having goodlooking kids. Not ugly kids from us. So the issue of pregnancy is solved as well.

Both of my incel friends agree that all we care about is having good sex and a fun relationship. and none of us actually want to spread our ugly genes and force future kids to be born ugly",12,1
Eternal September | KTP,"**Excerpt from ""[Eternal September](https://killtoparty.com/2020/09/19/eternal-september/)"":**

I liked the beach, but I didn‚Äôt love it like she did. I‚Äôd meet women there for first dates, where we‚Äôd find a bench and watch the sunset as the crashing waves create an ambient soundtrack. I can‚Äôt spend my days sitting on a beach, it makes me nervous to not use my time productively- a horrible consequence of too much time wasted- but at night I like listening to the stories of women.

Typically divorced, but not always- the ones who were married are usually the more mentally stable- they‚Äôll cite a dead bedroom and an unmotivated husband as their chief concern for initiating the separation. There will usually be a pang of regret over disrupting the lives of their children, and the inconvenience of sharing custody, although this is understood as collateral damage. They had all heard of Tinder and were ‚Äúexcited to try it,‚Äù with the initial burst of male interest serving as enthusiastic confirmation that they had made the right decision. You‚Äôll know how long a woman has been on her own by the way she talks about meeting men.

Be the Best F*ckin version or yourself,"Dear community!  
I cant say how much I thank you for existing!   
I had to break up with my oneitis a few months ago. She was going into my social media to see who I follow, she took my phone out of my hands to see who I speak with, she would constantly ask for disclosure of my whereabouts (even if I went to Dunkin which was like 2 minutes away from my home).  
Needless to say that she comes crying begging me to return. Even a few days ago, she says she is going to date another guy, while crying saying that misses me like hell.  


But my point of my post is not that. After I broke up, I got aware of the redpill. And the thing that I felt so powerful was about investing in myself.  
I am going to hit the gym hard soon (I am on the process of moving countries) and I am going to put braces. Not that I need them, but screw that, It will give me a major freaking boost of self esteem! I need to be the guy that attracts women, not women that attract me in the first place!  
So, I feel that once I am the best version of myself, i will be the one choosing!

No such thing as a Female Simp,"Women have one key advantage over men in the Sex Marketplace - the male desire for sex far outweighs the female desire for sex. As long as this leverage exists in an unregulated sexual marketplace then females will always be worshipped as celebrities and the males will always be the (only) fans. 

Women have true and natural abundance mindset in the unregulated market. No RedPill fakery - True Abundance for just turning up with her vagina.  


Look at this this way.  


How many women are buying d!ck pics on OnlyFans?  
How many men are making a living by posting selfies of their butt on Instagram?  
How many average male joes create a tinder account and get 1000 matches in a day? 

Women master the sexual marketplace because they have something all men want. Sex and Affection = OnlyFans

Even fat single moms in their 60's have about 30 beta orbiters a piece.  
You think a woman's weakness are her unregulated emotions?

Women are the masters of emotional manipulation and it is her greatest weapon in the battle of the sexes. They own this mental battlefield. The entire RedPill community was developed to try and even the score, but the fact remains that females victoriously manipulate and crush the average man in most cases, far exceeding the (tiny proportion) of men that have women beat in the emotional manipulation stakes. Why isn't there a female equivalent word for ""simping""? Because it doesn't exist.

It gets worse

From Krauser to Black Dragon, from Tom Torero to Todd V, from AMS to Heartiste, there is an agreement on one thing. Men don't just want sex. Men ultimately want affection and love from a woman. Women don't need male bluepill love. 

Men are hardwired simps.  


90% of Redpill is Oneitis/Pussy Worship protection and I recognise that the community still hasn't solved this problem. The only way to avoid Oneitis is to bang women who you genuinely don't care about. How fun is it banging a woman that you don't care about? It is fun for about 3 orgasms before you're off to find the next woman who you don't care about. Do this hundreds of times and get BlackPilled like Roosh V and eventually start craving a woman who you care about again - thus, women collectively win. Guess what happened to Roosh when he found a woman who he cared about and LTR'd? She dumped him and he went GodPill. So much for ""Bang"".

You can only truly Game a woman who you don't care about and are not invested in. This eventually becomes a void and soulless pursuit. It is fun for 100-200 notches, then the returns diminish and you can't even remember half of your bangs.

You can Game a woman and make her your Love/Sex Slave only if you don't care about her. You have to be able to walk away the minute she starts rebelling. How satisfying is it spending your time with a woman you don't care about? Not very.  


Male need for sex and (ultimately) affection/love from a woman is the ultimate power imbalance. All players, with almost no exceptions, eventually burnout and want to settle down with a woman who loves him. Guess what happens to a man who falls in love and settles down with a woman? She dumps him.  


To quote the cliche - Men are the true romantics and love idealistically. Woman are hypergamous and love opportunistically. Woman are attracted to men who don't care about them, Men are ultimately attracted to Women who they care about. It's irreconcilable. Nature is cruel.  


Because of Governments, Women don't need providers anymore and this was the traditional male leverage. Slut shaming (Hypergamy shaming) is also pretty much a crime now so women have unbridled power to pursue their sexual strategy.",256,1

"LMR, don‚Äôt be afraid to leave.","Summary 

Went on a date with HB9, she got in her head and refused to come back to my place. I left, without her. 

Body

So tonight I went on a date with a HB9. We had arranged to meet for drinks after work. We work in the same department but entirely different roles. 

We met for drinks and stayed at place A for a few hours. Whilst there, a group of 4 girls (also working at our company) showed up. The HB9 was a little embarrassed but brushed it off. Date continued. I escalated kino and sexual tension. 

I went in for the kiss and she didn‚Äôt resist and we had good kiss. 
We continued chatting and flirting and had a couple more kissing sessions. She was very into it, as was I. 

We moved on to the next bar and had a couple more drinks and made out some more. At this venue we got as far as me rubbing her pussy through her pants and her stroking my cock through my jeans.  She was very into it. After a couple of drinks and a few more kissing sessions, I suggested we get a taxi back to my place. She agrees so I call a taxi. When the taxi arrives she‚Äôs suddenly showing reluctance to get in the taxi with me. She cites that she is worried about what the group of work girls who saw us earlier will say. She has a friend who lives nearby (which she had mentioned earlier) that she will stay with. I try to get convince her to get in the taxi with me but she isn‚Äôt having any of it. So I say, okay, well I‚Äôll talk to you later. I get in the taxi, AND LEAVE. 

This is where alpha mentality comes to the forefront. I demonstrated that it didn‚Äôt bother if she came with me or not. I was happy to leave without her. And I did. I went back to place and got into bed. 

She then hits me up with ‚ÄúI wish I had come with you, I‚Äôm sleeping on my friends sofa etc etc‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt reply.  

This was key to maintaining frame. I showed abundance mentality by leaving her behind. 

I showed alpha mentality by not responding to her complaints about her situation after not coming with me. 

Don‚Äôt be afraid to leave a girl behind and continue on as if you aren‚Äôt bothered you didn‚Äôt F-close. 
This will show abundance mentality and an independence to the outcome of the date. 

Yes, I wanted fuck her. But no, I wasn‚Äôt bothered by the fact that she got into her own head and didn‚Äôt acquiesce to coming home with me. I left her behind, went home and had a great sleep. 

I woke up to multiple messages from her and requests to meet up again soon. 

I guarantee that she will be putty in my hands the next time we meet up and I will fuck her. 

She wanted to come back to my place. She said as much. ASD meant that she didn‚Äôt want other people to say bad things about her. I had already told her earlier on in the night that my private life is private. She didn‚Äôt want to come back to mine. Cool. It‚Äôs not my job to convince her. I have other options so I‚Äôm unconcerned with whether she comes back or not. I left. This left her wanting more. She wants this alpha dick. 

Moral of the story here is, no matter how much you escalate, sometimes she just don‚Äôt come back to your place. If this happens then you have to be willing to leave her. Don‚Äôt act butt hurt but be prepared to leave. This displays abundance mentality and an independence to whether she comes back to yours or not. 

She will be back and begging me to Dick her down. I guarantee it.",22,1
Self-Improvement != Self-Development,[removed],0,1
Cold Approaching: Risk vs. Reward,"I recently created a response in another thread and so many men were asking men to expand on my writeup by making it its own post that I finally did. Here that writeup in a nutshell:

I'm a decent looking 6'3"" guy who hasn't had any success with women for most of my life. It's not that I never tried approaching, it's just that rejection hit me so hard that after a single bad experience I would give up. That was me for my entire twenties, plus countless horrible experiences on dating apps.

Recently, I decided to say fuck it and just FORCE myself to do it. I moved to a heavily populated area and started approaching bitches like crazy. Most of the time rejections, and I'm not going to lie, a lot of them really hurt, but I kept going.

Men have to understand that it is built into women's DNA to be approached by men, and that's essentially the same for all mammals. Hundreds of millions of years of biological engineering that their role is to look pretty and the male's role is to fucking come up to them and talk to them. You can see this in action with any mammalian species. Watch some pickup videos, or hell even better, try it yourself. The first thing a woman will do when you approach her, assuming you've stated your intentions correctly, is **look you up and down**. She's sizing you up. Her female monkey brain has kicked in and now she's deciding whether she's attracted to you. And that's what approaching ultimately boils down to. You are \*ACTIVATING\* a part of the female brain that they simply have no control over. You're turning something on inside of her that she rarely, if ever gets to feel. The approach experience, if done correctly, puts her in a kind of instinctual trance that appeals to her most base nature and emotions.

Most women have no idea that they want this. Many women in the Millennial generation and younger would tell you that they dislike men approaching them, it's creepy, unnatural, ""I just want to exist in the world without being a sex object"" blah blah blah.

And yet, they are so dissatisfied with dating apps. So dissatisfied with virtual connections and artificial attraction. They keep asking, ""Where have all the real men gone?"" ""What's with the pussification of society?"" When they ask these questions, they don't even know what they mean, all they know is that some integral part of the dating/mating process is missing, and that no matter how many Tinder guys they fuck, they're not getting that ""hole"" filled.

The approach is an integral part of the mating process. They are designed for it. They **need** it. You are doing yourself and everyone else a disservice by trying to game the dating market virtually and artificially.

Since COVID, approaching has been much harder. I recently took my friend who was visiting from several states away to show him how to do it. I had such little investment in it because I was only showing him how to approach, and therefore couldn't care less about rejection. I couldn't get this guy to approach any women. I was surprised at how difficult it was for him after having done it so many times myself in the past year.

Then, I spotted a woman with the biggest ass I've ever seen, I approached her, scored her number, and now we're dating. She had a mask on, I didn't give a shit. He went home empty handed.

Point is, just like anything in life, no risk = no reward. The lower the risk, the less satisfying the outcome. That goes for attracting women as well. You want to use low risk bullshit dating apps? Okay, you'll get a reward based on your level of investment. You want to approach a woman and ask her for the time instead of telling her that she's the hottest bitch you've ever seen? You can expect an outcome based on the level of risk you've invested.

Do yourself a favor and take some fucking risks.

\--------------------------

That was the original post, so I'll expand a little bit. Like most things in life, the higher the risk involved, the more potential for reward. For awhile, there was a debate in the PUA community about whether to use the direct or indirect approach on women. For reference, the direct approach is exactly what it sounds like; approaching a woman and stating your direct intentions, and that can be as blatant as you like (I want to *fuck* you). The indirect approach is approaching a woman by making up some bullshit excuse about why you're there, and slowly creating attraction usually through some kind of ridiculous script or set of guidelines on how to create interest (read some of Roosh V's stuff, like Day Game for examples of this). For a time, these two camps debated about which was the best approach. I think at this point it's obvious that the direct approach has been far more successful.

When calculating risk vs. reward you have to think about it like this: When approaching a woman, if you do it indirectly and ask for the time, there are almost no stakes. She can't really reject you because you didn't **invest** anything. If you ask what time it is and she tells you she has a boyfriend, it's she who looks like a bitch, not you. Even if she knows why you're really there (and a lot of women do), according to the rules of social convention you can simply play dumb and she'll look like a fucking Karen.

Alternatively, if you approach a woman and tell her that you want to fuck her, you're taking an extreme risk and investing a lot. You're breaching the unwritten rules of social convention that frown on that sort of thing. So what's the benefit of taking such a risk? Because if it works, it *really* works. Walking up to a random hot chick and telling her you want to fuck her (which by the way, I would **never** recommend you do) would create extreme attraction \*IF\* she were interested. It would lead to sex almost immediately because you started the relationship with such confidence and direct masculine energy.

So those are the two extremes of the cold approach: Insanely indirect by making some bullshit excuse to talk to her and ridiculously direct by telling her *exactly* what you want. Both of these approaches are usually not going to work for a simple reason, they're *too extreme*. Yes, a risk can be too high of a risk. Of course if it pays of the reward is incredible, but the chance of it failing is too high to justify the costs.

If you simply approach a woman and tell her that she's beautiful, or that you saw her from across the way and had to come talk to her, it's a good amount of risk, but a much higher chance of success in terms of getting her number.

What you want when approaching women, as with all things in life, is to take a **calculated risk**. If using an indirect approach, you're taking almost no risk at all because you're not investing at all. However, if using a direct approach, you must decide how much investment you want to reveal, and thus how high of a risk you're willing to take. Something that's relatively low risk, but still a direct approach is simply walking up to her and saying, ""Hi! I'm whoever."" You've expressed interest in the sense that you're talking to her and you're not making bullshit excuses to be there. An approach that's relatively high risk, but still within the margins of reasonable is to approach and tell her that some feature of her body made her want to speak to her. These kinds of compliments are tailored to the woman and thus are generally received with more flattery than the generic ""you're beautiful"", but have a higher chance of backfiring. Again, we have the risk vs. reward dynamic presenting itself in all its glory.

One final thing I have to explain is why taking risks is important in the first place. Because your ultimate goal with women is to *make them feel something*. Never forget that. Women are emotional creatures, they **need** to feel vibrant emotions. The more risks you take, the more you make them feel. It's as simple as that. Making a woman feel something is not a guarantee that she'll go home with you (she could feel abject terror after all), but making her feel nothing is a guarantee that she won't. If you use an indirect approach on her, she's not going to feel anything. You invested nothing, you took no risks, and you played it so safe that she will forget you ever existed. This is why good men and ""nice guys"" fail and why the bad boys always win. Because bad boys take risks, and risks make women wet.

One person asked me how to ""activate"" a woman's monkey brain to begin the attraction process when you approach. That's simple, you tell her why you're fucking there. That's all there is to it.

I could keep going but this post is already so long as it is. Look guys, there are veterans and professionals that are way better at this stuff than I am, and so I will recommend the best advice I have found so far that I'm confident will help you as well.

James Marshall is a cold approaching god. Absorb as much stuff of his as you can possibly find. [Please watch this video first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33rsHCWgISI&amp;feature=youtu.be), it may change your life.

[Models by Mark Manson](https://www.amazon.com/Models-Attract-Women-Through-Honesty-ebook/dp/B005EOTH24/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=). This is widely considered the holy grail of dating and seduction advice. If you haven't read this book yet, you're shooting yourself in the foot. Go read it.

[Atomic Attraction by Christopher Canwell](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Attraction-Create-Maintain-Women-ebook-dp-B078N43RL3/dp/B078N43RL3/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=). Amazing book that goes into the scientific evidence of seduction and the psychology of women. Please read this too, it will change your life. He also has a Youtube channel with plenty of useful content called Develop Attraction.

Finally, subscribe to as many Redpill Youtube channels as you can possibly find. Some of my favorites are Strong Successful Male, Darius M, Donovan Sharpe, Rich Cooper, and Rollo Tomassi. This stuff needs to be your life. IMMERSE yourself in it. You've got beta blue pill programming and you need to be bombarded with the correct way of thinking as much as possible, whenever possible, from every direction of your consciousness. Red pill is not a behavior, it's not a lifestyle, it's an identity. If your identity has not changed, you are still blue pill.

On a final note: If you really want success with the attraction and seduction process, you need to **fully invest** yourself into it. Either fully invest and make a commitment to yourself to grow and take risks, or give up now and stop wasting your time. And I don't mean that as an insult. Men who can't fully invest themselves into this for whatever reason probably need to find a different hobby. Either go ham or go home.",16,1

Fourth Generational Warfare: How Women Are Being Weaponized Against You And What You Can Do About It,"The sexual marketplace is currently in the midst of the largest transition since the launch of Tinder in 2012, and absolutely nobody here is talking about it. Why? Because as of today in 2020 the Red Pill is filled with autists. Autism is characterized by difficulty understanding social context and communication and by restricted or repetitive patterns of thought and behavior. Autists want to autistically repeat clich√©s ad nauseam, in an effort to convince themselves and everyone around them, that they get *it*. Unfortunately, *it* is rapidly changing, and what worked in 2005 and 2010 is not what works today. It's in everyone's best interest that we the Red Pill stop pretending that nothing has changed since the Red Pill's founding, so we can provide useful up-to-date advice and get our nerd-virgins laid, which let's be honest is harder than ever before.




Back in 2012 when the Red Pill first got started things weren't good or normal but sexually speaking they were better than they are now. Back in the day, all you had to do to get laid was take a picture of your abs in a dirty gym mirror and right swipe all the girls with low self-esteem, which was all of them. It was as easy as shooting father-less fish in a barrel. Back before [Netflix](https://youtu.be/qNgDuvQkRwc) was synonymous with pedophilia you could use the low effort line: Netflix and Chill. Or you could just say something wild like:  Ay girl call me Rambo cuz I'ma be in your Vietnamese tunnel. √ìrale puta, cruise on over and slurp my horchata. Or you could drop a real bomb like: I can make your black life matter. Women were way less on edge about political correctness and if they got buttmad, you could just remind them of who was in charge of the country. Girl calm your tits, the president is black and the first lady is a tranny. What more do you want anyway? Then she would agree with you and drive over to gargle your man-batter. Those were the good old days.




To understand the glacial shift that took place in the sexual marketplace we first need to get to the root political cause. Unfortunately, this presents a stumbling block for the Coomers Zoomers and Boomers here who are too shortsighted to navigate the *is-ought destinction* and insist that's sexual strategy isn't political/ideological. While I agree that sexual strategy *ought* not to be political and pre-2010 it wasn't to a meaningful degree. In 2020 sexual strategy *is* political, in the same way football is now political and preventing arsonists from burning your property is now political. Feminists have been saying ""The Personal is Political"" since the 1970s however back then the middle class had better things to do than to listen to chunklers, wierdos and scolds. Fast forward to 2010 when the widespread adoption of the smartphone created a direct propaganda pipeline straight into women's malleable impressionable minds. 




By 2020 years of [non-stop misinformation and psychological warfare](https://youtu.be/2DDXG-dHugc) have eroded the conventions of modern man and twisted reality into such hideous shapes that the face of truth can no longer be discerned by most. Reality has been promoted to the rank of imposter and replaced by hyperreality. It's an aberration rampaging through the byways of people's minds and directing them on a collision course with mass delusion and insanity, creating a resonance loop that negates any negative feedback. The only things that remain tenable are base feelings and the instant gratification of intoxication. This process creates a schizophrenic who lives to consume new products and identities, and quickly discards old products and old identities.




The weaponization of NPCs for political ends via propaganda is a well-documented tactic known as [Fourth Generational Warfare](https://www.bitchute.com/video/DS7CN67XL1lb/). Notable examples include Libya, Syria, Ukraine, Belarus, and what's currently happening right in America culminating sometime in January. The reason why this concerns us here at the Red Pill is that the same tactics are used by the media and education systems to weaponize women against men. Females are the perfect target for psyops because females never really grow into adults, they just grow tits. **Effectively there are two kinds of shit tests: organic shit tests, which are a normal part of intersexual dynamics and inorganic shit tests which are ideas implanted into a woman's childlike susceptible brain to create conflict and division in order to destabilize a relationship.** Notable examples include [Murder Porn for housewives](https://youtu.be/ZtGYSDXEFSc), [Divorce Porn](https://www.divorcemag.com/wp-content/uploads/Images/press-releases/FLCover.jpg), Gender Wage Gap, Affirmative Consent, ¬º women were raped, MeToo, Pussy Hat marches, –íL–ú black square posting. Women are conditioned by ideological state apparatuses to pull the rug out from under their husbands and sons so that they will be too weak to challenge the establishment.




This brings me to my conclusion.

Conservative moralizing does nothing to stop the psychological warfare being waged against Western civilization, and only serves to make it more effective. Conforming to the values of a degenerate society will only make you a slow predictable target. The only viable solution to a psyop is running your own counter psyop. If you are a dull Devin or boring Brad, the women in your life will be psyop-ed out from under you in your own domestic version of a color revolution. George Soros will mind warp the women in your life and will be inflicting cock and ball torture by proxy. If you don't want George Soros playing with your cock and balls via a Smartphone-addled NPC, you need to be able to set the narrative in your own household.

THE RED PILL TRANSCENDS SEXUAL STRATEGY,"A chronic problem that red pilled men go through is that we act alpha and attract submissive women, argument can be made that all women are submissive for the right guy but that‚Äôs beside the point, then this when they try to subconsciously we may say betafy us immediately and we push back using techniques in the side bar (for the hundredth time if you haven‚Äôt read the sidebar do it now) and they submit to us big time and over time we get accustomed and to a point addicted to the feelz and by nature once you‚Äôre addicted to something, you‚Äôre going to do all in your power to chase that high, now here is where nature played fakers big time cause when you‚Äôre chasing that high, out of conditioning and the mere fact that you‚Äôre a junkie, you‚Äôll try to get those feelz from your woman in the easiest way possible and plus you‚Äôve become complacent since what else is a junkie going to do.

So you‚Äôll be nice to her and try to reciprocate all those little cute things she does. This is where the danger lies fellows, as you well know and if you reread the sidebar from time to time would remember, this will cause her coochie to dry up more than the Sahara and the butterflies will fly away .

Even seasoned red pill gurus have fallen for the old con of being charmed by the female charm of a particularly beautiful and submissive ass.

Now to the remedies of this malady

* Re and re-read classic red pill material from time to time in order to stay indoctrinated because believe it or not this teachings are foreign to everything the world teaches men.
* Lift and for people like me missing a day makes me lazy and consequently want to miss more day so do at least a little work out everyday
* Always keep two in the kitty, this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you have several plates but you should be casually flirting with several titties at any given time as a possible cure for oneitis
* Have a mission other than your woman, make goals long term and short term that should be broken down to smaller goals that can be achieved on a day to day basis e.g if you‚Äôre restoring your car that might be a job for one year but you should have a set goal of what should be done by the end of a said day.
* Don‚Äôt compromise or procrastinate on a scheduled work unless it is totally unavoidable, skipping one day makes you more at risk of skipping other days
* Reward yourself for following through with a scheduled task, remember the lizard brain that we talk about that makes females rationalize stupid things well even males have it and the lizard brain remembers what gave it pleasure, to increase your chances of repeating the said task.
* Say no from time to time, you‚Äôre a busy man; don‚Äôt be available every time your chick wants something.
* Have a ~~gang~~ friend group if possible of fellow men that you‚Äôre the unsaid leader of ,for what you ask:

1. Order around to display your leadership qualities to your mate and others, she will see you as alpha more when others treat you as one.
2. Do your bidding
3. Mentor other men without of course mentioning fight club as I‚Äôve learnt people are more prone to remember what they teach others.
4. Act as a reminder that you should get comfortable and do what you tell them not to and if they‚Äôre even half worthy they‚Äôll call you out when you slack off

* ¬∑ For all that is sacred sake, write a post and let it be deleted and write another one again until you have something worthy to share here.",2,1

&amp;#x200B;

I scheduled a date for Saturday, she wanted to chat and at first I was kinda turned off by that, but I didn't want to be rude by ignoring her, so I kinda went with it, although I made sure to not reply too often.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me she just got home from a bar, and now she's just chilling at a gas station at 11PM. She asked me if I want to join her, I said yes.

&amp;#x200B;

I get there and she's VERY excited to see me, she confessed to me she completely fell in love with me. We go for a walk and after stopping at a view, I decide to go for a kiss. She was kinda surprised, but ended up really liking it. I must have been awkward AF because she asked if I've ever been on a date (LOL). I told her it's been a long time and I'm kinda nervous.

&amp;#x200B;

We kept making out some more and she told me she loves my arms, how cute I am etc... She said she didn't expect me to go for a kiss straight away.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I fucked up here, after she said she was sleepy, I suggested she comes over to my place. She was very surprised by this, asked what are you looking for. I had the sidebar answer ready: Friends, maybe more. She said she's looking for an LTR not ONS, I answered - maybe we can work something out.

&amp;#x200B;

When I walked her home, I grabbed her ass while we were making out and told her she has a very nice butt. She really loved hearing this.

&amp;#x200B;

The moral of the story is none of this would have been possible without gym and a diet!!! So don't you dare skip a workout!!!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The bad news is - this girl is a red flag parade!!! Black/white dyed hair, 13 tats, pierced nipple, said she's been in a FMM threesome, watches hentai (19yo). Total babe though.

&amp;#x200B;

Sucks that the first girl that falls in love with me is like that. But I've never gotten this far with any woman ever! And I've never had a GF. So maybe this could be a learning opportunity???

"I think I might be asexual, I just want the intimacy without the sex, lost cause?"," Hey guys,

I am 23 y old. Not very bad good looking, got some flaws, like being short, already losing hair, but I workout and try to dress/smell well so I am very close to the 'best version of myself'. I have some hobbies that help me spark interest in girls like magic/hypnosis.

Till lately, I never realized that I never really wanted sex. I had sex 3 times and didn't come any of them. Granted, 1 I was high, and 2 drunk, but it didn't make any sense to me in the 1st place. Now, I never questioned it, I thought it was just drugs. Still, the fact that I never think about sex or never masturbated to porn started to worry me. I discovered asexuality, and thought that they couldn't masturbate or anything, but they actually can.

Now let's go back to puberty, I hit puberty and NEVER masturbated till one day I was watching WWE and saw a man vs women match. DING, I got excited, and this is the only thing that turn me on. Problem is that I don't even enjoy 'Naked wrestling'. I only masturbate to competitive wrestling. If it's not realistic, I can't get off, so the videos are very rare.

Should I try asking girls to wrestle before sex, maybe it'll work? The problem is; if I don't even fantasize bout the idea of putting my thing in a girl, why would I like it in real life? I find porn repulsive tbh. I do enjoy female intimacy and company, but I've been so picky and missed so many opportunities because I am searching for a 'male' friend in a girl, which was a total failure up until now. When I go for girls, it's more to validate myself as desirable rather than to have sex. I often even stop the date if she wants to go up to my place because I already know she wants to have sex.

From this sub, I understand that you can't be too intimate with girls. So as I understand it,I already have the best intimacy I could get: Friends. Already made lot of durable friendships, even with 1 girls, and they've all proven themselves to me, so is this as best as it gets ?",4,1

"Absorbing the Loss of a ""Good Woman"" is how you get Rpilled","I have written below my most valuable lesson in the Game and what seems to happen to all DJ's sooner or later.

There's a popular concept in PUA/Redpill that women are AWALT, without any exceptions.

However, life tells a different story for most of us DJs. You eventually come across a girl who is different from all the rest. You want to keep her because you objectively note her high value and the way she makes you feel (mind blowing sex, great company, chemistry, great shared experiences/memories, intellectual/spiritual/emotional connection etc).

This Good Woman comes into your life. You didn't necessarily plan on it. You were just doing your own thing, spinning plates and leading a free existence.

Months go by and you realise you've been spending a lot of time with this One girl. She has made it so easy for you. She arrives at your door every day with her eyes sparkling. She is besotted with you. Your other plates start to dissolve into the background and you fall into a bubble with your ""good woman"" - you enter co-dependency and Oneitis. You don't even notice it at first. It's usually a slow process to reach a point of ""needing"" her in your life. This happens through spending all of your time with her and isolating yourself from your options. You are now in scarcity. You have naively fallen under the feminine spell of your Good Woman.

Because you're a player and you know you could bang other women, you may feel frustrated from time-to-time that this ""good woman"", through her feminine magic, has isolated you from your options. However, you accept the isolation because you have fallen in love with her and the thought and fear of losing her eventually eclipses your will to act on your desires for other women. You have allowed this isolation to take place because nearly all men have one fatal weakness - an addiction to feminine affection that far exceeds our addiction to sex. The love and devotion of a Good Woman is the most powerful feeling a man can experience. You become her superhero and she worships you, you become her God.

Soon, you begin to notice this Oneitis is weakening you. You feel lazy and complacent, intoxicated by your woman like a junkie languishing in an opium den. You begin to make concessions to your woman. She has pacified you. To regain power and your sense of self you may temporarily act on your desires for variety and cheat with other women. All this does is serve to remind you of how special your Oneitis is. You go back to her, after cheating, feeling even more affection and love. She is none the wiser and is she is also intoxicated by your subliminal indecisiveness. You are her caged animal. She senses it. She doesn't fully own your soul yet, but she will soon.

She slowly but surely dissolves your masculine fortress and she becomes a part of you. A part of your identity. You are in serious trouble now. You can't leave her. You need her. She has become essential to your world.

You project your Oneitis onto her and assume, naturally, that she has Oneitis for you too. This is where the unravelling begins. The balance of power begins to subtly shift. She senses that you ""need"" her. Her subconscious starts to question your true worth - ""Why does this man need me? I'm just a little girl, lost and scared, and this man is relying on me for his validation. He is so nice to me. Why??""

She begins to subtly sh!t test you. Little things like passive non-compliance. You fail a few of these tests. You lose your temper with her. She then starts to sh!t test more, desperate to see if you are a man who doesn't react to her feminine capriciousness. After failing more tests, she begins to build a new subconscious image of you. You are now a weak man in her eyes.

Then the distancing starts. A woman's true power comes from the giving and withdrawal of affection. It will be subtle at first. She will begin to express desires to do things outside of the relationship. She's no longer fulfilled by your presence in her life alone. The challenge of taming the savage bull is gone because you are always there and she senses your devotion to her. You are no longer her bull.

During the distancing process she may ask to go travelling somewhere, to go out on the town, to visit new places, to build more friendship circles. Alongside this, she will start to criticise you subtly, then openly. Little things at first. It might be as simple as telling you to take your shoes off at the front door (little compliance tests). She will start engaging less with your opinions and points of view. She will start questioning your masculine opinions and expressing scepticism. She has started to rebel against you and lose faith in your leadership.

Her admiration for you as a man is starting to fall.

If you are a good lover, then you can confuse this process for her because the sex is still great. You can make her come easily. She loves your sex, but her emotional/ intellectual connection to you is waning alongside of this. Great sex is an excellent bonding tool, but it is not enough if your woman also senses that you've fallen deeply in love with her. Her hindbrain can't be satisfied with this display of weakness and neediness. She senses your misguided male idealised Love and your failure to recognise her hypergamous, opportunistic feminine Love. She only loved you because she saw you as Above Her. She now feels she is your equal, or better than you. She can't control her inner disgust as this becomes realised. How can you be her best option if you need her so much? This must mean she can do better, and she starts to see the green grass on the other side of the fence. A rich, emerald sparkling shade of green. Your relationship has become a muddy paddock.

When your relationship has entered this dynamic where she KNOWS you love her idealistically, then the relationship is fragile. You may be able to maintain this dynamic for years, but your relationship is terminally vulnerable to outside influences:

\- She meets an alpha at work who gives her tingles.  
\- Her single friends start to tempt her towards ""muhhhh freedom"" and ""YOLO Independent Womanhood"".  
\- She starts building a life and support networks away from you (this will become her go-to when she leaves you).  
\- She starts spending nights with friends, family. She has stopped mate guarding you. You find yourself at home, while she is out. You begin to wonder what she's up to and waiting for her call.

Then, one day, a fight happens. You are frustrated with her rebellion. She's not the woman she used to be anymore. You make a power move and try to pull her into line - maybe you even instigate a fake break-up to scare her. She goes to her friends and tells them what a controlling and abusive boyfriend you are. They empower her to block you and cut you off. This was too easy for her.

The woman and the relationship that you've invested months and years in is gone in the blink of an eye. Seemingly overnight she has flicked her mental switch and has re-written you as a Nobody. Briffault's Law comes into play - your only value is how you're making your woman feel in that moment. Your history together and your past investment in her is not taken into consideration. She is a creature of ""The Moment."" No history, only the Now. Women are slaves to their present emotional state.

You are shocked by her strength and her ice coldness. She withdraws and disappears. Often she will be unreachable - either she's blocked you on all devices, or she is unresponsive to your calls and messages. Maybe she will communicate with you, but she's cold as a corpse. Your attempts at re-attraction fail dismally and your self esteem plummets. This was a woman who was once your Love Slave, and now she won't even talk to you. This is the hardest experience a proud man will ever face.

Some men never recover from this ego-shattering experience. Your mind tortures you with imagined scenarios of how you could have acted differently. With the benefit of hindsight, you see the relationship's decline with clearer eyes (something your proud ego was previously preventing you from seeing while you still had her - ""She'll never leave me"").

The dreaded ""If Only"" - If only you'd intervened earlier when she started distancing. If only you'd followed the rules and distanced even more when she began the distancing process. Why did you pursue her and try to negotiate attraction like a needy beta? You know better than this! How could you have been so stupid? You KNEW the rules, but you were lost in Oneitis and you thought the rules didn't apply to you - ""This girl is different""-Syndrome.

You live with the regret. You broke the rules of attraction. You lost her. This is the archetypal story of Man in his journey of Idealised Love and Oneitis. This the the darkest shade of the Redpill.",325,1

For all you young guys jumping the Keto bandwagon.....,"I'm a 48 year old male that has been lifting since I was 15....Still love it to this day even though I'm not near as strong as I was when I was Div 1aa football player....but I digress....

When I was 23, I decided to do the Atkins diet....whicn is VERY similar to the new -fangled Ketogenic Diets of today...I lost a bunch of fat.....thought it was great......thought I'd be on it for the rest of my life......Totally ignored the fact that my strength was going down thanks to you know, no carbs.....All was great until...

Trying to sustain the diet was very difficult....and I inevitably fell off the Low carb bandwagon and for the love of God, the fat came back with a vengeance!  The rebound was absurd. 

Since then, I've tried to jump back on the low carb bandwagon from time to time only to find that the weight does not come off near as easy as the 1st time around....AND I feel like absolute dog shit on low carb diets now, even though I didn't  back then...

I've recently taken a more modest approach based on calories and protein.....Working very well.  Losing fat at about 1-2 lbs per week and strength staying very good. I literally track overall calories and  protein and that's it.  

So in summary....be careful before you jump onto a Ketogenic Diet.  Many here promote it as the end all be all but for MOST people, it is NOT SUSTAINABLE......The guys that are saying it is sustainable are either outliers OR have not been doing it very long.  You will eventually incorporate carbs back into your diet and you will BLOW up.  

Don't be suckered.  Your metabolism, aesthetics and strength will suffer in the long run.

Good Luck.",2,1
Lying to Sugar Babies for Free Sex: Remember the amorality of sexual strategy,"*Sexual strategy is amoral. There are those who have sex, and there are those who do not. What contract will you sign up for? The one that results in you having sex? Or the ones that you're told are moral to uphold but do not bring you sex?* - redpillschool 

# Introduction: Put your morals away and put your cock in a slut. 

I‚Äôm seeing an awful lot of bullshit in the community about morality and virtue, while I‚Äôm not opposed to the concepts that‚Äôs not where I‚Äôm here for and it‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre here for either. 

We're here to fuck bitches. You‚Äôre either making a bitch drink your unborn children like the sick cannibal she is or you‚Äôre leaving your unborn children in a little sock while you cope to yourself that you‚Äôre such a virtuous man. 

You all need to learn how to *lie and get what you want.* Women do it to us all the time, so we can‚Äôt we? As long as my dick gets wet I don‚Äôt give a fuck and neither should you.   

### Okay, but why the fuck would you do this? 

1. For the lulz. 

2. To see if I can maintain such a grand lie. Whether you like it or not, lying is a good skill to have, and the only way to get good at lying is to put yourselves in situations where lying is paramount to achieving your desired objective.

### Body: The Method

A couple of weeks ago a friend of mine told me about how he tricks sugar babies into cheap sex. First, he paints himself out to be an extremely rich dude. Then, he finds a girl he likes and promises them a base ‚Äútrial‚Äù amount for the first month in order to lowball them, but in the same offer, he promises almost double or triple the amount if the first month goes well. If she agrees he fucks her once, pays her the promised amount, then ghosts. 

This works because it makes the bitch believe that she could be in for something special and long term as long as she qualifies yourself to you. 

If they take the bait you‚Äôre golden, if they don‚Äôt take the bait or press too much, just drop them. Young gullible bitches are everywhere.  

I decided to take this further and see how I can fuck for free. After some thinking I came up with three possible ways for me to fuck without paying her a dime; 

1. Promise her money at the end of the month, fuck her, then ghost her before the month is over.

2. If she insists on a pay per meet (PPM) I insist on paying after. If she agrees, I fuck, then kick her out. If she stays I just report her for trespassing. The fuck she gonna do? Tell the cops I didn‚Äôt pay her for sex? 
3. Improvise. When it comes to money and women nothing is certain. I have a strong enough frame to make some bullshit about how I forgot the cash or how I‚Äôll venmo her later or something.  
Note: Always keep the agreed amount on you just in case she finds a way to make you pay and ALWAYS BOOK MORE THAN ONE BITCH. You never know when a woman, especially a glorified hooker, will flake on you. 

### Application of the method

I created an account on seekingarrangements, paid the fee, then requested a refund for the fee because the product was ""defective."" 

I'm still a premium member to this very day on their dime. 

Next, I created an entirely different image for myself. I gave myself a fake name, put on some fancy clothes, and said I was a 20 something-year-old that inherited his father's fortune and used his fortune to invest in cryptocurrency and stocks.

I did the same thing I usually do on dating apps. Very little small talk then bag the number. Once I got the number I offered them the following; 250 a night to meet 4 times a month for a total of 1000 for the first month, if the first month goes well I bump the meetings up to 500 or maybe even 750 depending on how good they are to me. 

Some declined because they ""aren't hookers"" and others declined because the ""trial period"" seemed suspicious. A few were stupid enough to bite. 

A couple of nights ago,  I was supposed to meet a bitch and fuck her for 250. I had no intention of paying. I was just going to fuck her and kick her out. She flaked after I paid for the hotel and everything. 

I'd expect nothing less from a woman AND a hooker. I called a back-up that told me she was free all weekend and asked if she was still free. I gave her the address and she pulled up. 

When she arrived she asked me a shit load of questions about how I make my money and who I am. I answered them all with ease, I had already rehearsed them 1000 times in my head. 

She warmed up to me. She knew why I called her so I didn't have to bother escalating, she began taking off her clothes like the good little slut I was ""paying"" her to be. 

For a glorified hooker, she was pretty trash at sex. Doesn't matter, got the nut off. 

After we were done she said, ""So, do you have the 250?""  

""No, I don't. Give me your Venmo and I'll pay you later."" 

She hesitated, but I didn't budge. I already fucked the bitch, I won. I was ready to call security if need be; I was deadset on not paying this bitch unless she had a gun or a pimp. 

After a few moments of silence, she gave me her Venmo.

""See you next time baby,"" I said as I slapped her ass when she left the hotel room. 

I blocked her and didn't pay her a dime.   



# Takeaways 
 1. Get your cock out of your sock and lie to bitches if you need to. Sex is sex. You're either fucking or you're not. 

 2. Sell a bitch a fantasy with good enough frame and she'll sell you her most cherished possession; her pussy. 

 3. Once you fuck a bitch you've already won and she knows it.

"When a woman say she was/is in an abusive relationship or marriage, Abusive is a Code word for women."," 

I've been in an abusive relationship/marriage. I'm sure everyone here has once or more heard this from a woman, but what I have found is that most of the cases it's not an abusive man.

I've found out that most times this is a CODE word for

* I wanted to live an irresponsible life but he couldn't allow me.
* I wanted to live like a single woman, going out, partying, drinking and fucking everything which has y chromosome but he doesn't allow me.
* he doesn't allow me to use the credit cards as I wish, don't forget most times he is the one paying the credits)
* I want to be free, do whatever I want whenever I want. I want to go/travel where I want alone but he can't allow it.
* He wants me to cook and clean and make a beautiful home but I can't and don't know how to do that.
* I want to wear and post provocative styles and flirt with other dudes but he don't want it.
* He takes care of his family; he wants to put every think the good way, so he is a controlling bitch.
* He needs exclusivity but I'm a slut and one man can't satisfy me.
* ............ you guys if you look closely you will find other translations for the code ""abusive marriage/relationship)

correct me if my analysis is wrong.

Disclaimer: not that abusive men doesn't exist, it's my perspective when most women say the word abusive in a marriage/relationship. I guess 90% it's not an abusive man.",133,1

Acceptance Is The Fire That Burns Grief,"Men nowadays feel more disconnected and isolated then they ever have been in the past hundred years.

*Loneliness* is the night ceasing to make a noise. All because one is too afraid to make a move.

 Now, we all know these feelings, and frankly I don't wish discuss them too much. However, something needs to be said of why so many men feel these emotions and feelings and how to solve them.

One can lose a dollar and consider it a tragedy, another can and not consider it tragic. 

Pain, can be adjusted for, that's what calluses are for. The more pain one suffers the thicker the callus.

Loneliness; if you feel lonely when you are alone, you are in bad company.

How to Stop Being Creepy and Needy,"**Introduction**

Most men fail with women for one of two reasons: 1) they are afraid of coming off as creepy or needy, so they don‚Äôt push the gas hard enough or 2) they are actually creepy or needy, so they push the gas too hard. This article is about striking the right balance between being aggressive and not overly aggressive. My goal with this article is to teach you what creepiness is so you can stop worrying about it and be more confident. Once you know what creepiness is, you can be more open to expressing yourself to women, not less. 

Creepiness, neediness, desperation, selfishness, and beta behavior are all symptoms of the same thing: emotional overinvestment. Emotional overinvestment when you focus too much of your thoughts on emotions on a thing or person, which causes you to want it too much. It is ok to want to eat a sandwich for lunch, but it is creepy to think about the sandwich all day to the exclusion of everything else. It is ok to love your mother, but it is creepy to spend 8 hours every day talking on the phone with her. Girls want to be wanted, but not too much.

People emotionally overinvest for many reasons, with a major reason being scarcity. Scarcity is the feeling that 1) we want or need something, and 2) we have no easy way of getting that thing, so whenever we have a chance to get that thing we must focus all of our attention on getting it. Everybody needs to eat, but most people in developed countries don‚Äôt obsess about their next meal because they know they can get food whenever they want. But if you were starving and had no food you would spend all day thinking about food and you would stop at nothing if you thought there was a possibility of getting a sandwich.

Scarcity in turn is caused by a shitty self-image. We feel scarcity with respect to a certain thing because we subconsciously feel we are not good enough to get that thing. When the cashier at McDonald‚Äôs smiles at us, we emotionally invest in her because we feel like no other woman will want to have sex with us. Surprisingly, scarcity has nothing to do with how many women you have or can get: lots of attractive guys and even celebrities can get tons of pussy but still feel scarcity and act creepy. A guy can also have nothing and still feel abundance. Scarcity is a mindset: the difference between what you think you can get and what you think you need ‚Äì by adjusting those variables, you can eliminate that mindset. ¬†¬†

Some of you may be thinking ‚Äúthis shit article does not apply to be me because I am not creepy or needy.‚Äù Bruh, you are probably a creep. All men have a natural tendency to emotionally overinvest in women, and even a little too much emotional overinvest will cause women to run for the hills. You don‚Äôt need to be hiding in her bushes with binoculars for her to feel uneasy. If you act just a little too emotionally overinvested in a woman, her subconscious mind will register you as a creep even if your actions are outwardly socially acceptable. Women have evolved a very sensitive ability to sense of what men are emotionally invested in, and if they can sense that men are emotionally overinvested in them, they feel a strong aversion, even if they would otherwise be attracted to the man.

Because humans evolved to ‚Äúsense‚Äù creepiness, there are objective criteria to what is and is not creepy, and if you learn this criteria, you can ¬†1) stop being creepy and 2) not have to worry about whether you are being creepy. Even if you don‚Äôt believe my theory, you need objective criteria to guide your actions because you absolutely cannot base your behavior on what women do and do not judge to be creepy. Women often have bizarre or stupid criteria for determining creepiness, they misjudge situations all the time, and they sometimes make false accusations of creepiness out of pure spite. More importantly, you cannot read womens‚Äô minds so you have no idea what they will think is creepy.

**The alpha male quid pro quo**

The key to controlling your emotional investment in women is this: you must only do things for women after they have done something for you and only in proportion to what they have done for you. She should do something for you, you should then reciprocate, she should then do something bigger for you, you should reciprocate on a slightly bigger level, and so forth. By ‚Äúdoing things‚Äù I mean anything: buying her things, doing favors for her, or even giving her attention or looking at her. I call this rule the ‚Äúalpha male quid pro quo‚Äù and I think it is the single most important rule when interacting with women.

The alpha male quid pro quo applies in every situation, with every woman, no matter how hot or important she is, and throughout the whole relationship, no matter how long you have known her. It applies in real life, over text, in dating apps, and across every category of your relationship. In addition, it only applies to objectively meaningful things she has done for you ‚Äì actions mean more than words. If she has promised she will do a bunch of things for you, or gave you a bunch of sweet compliments, or texted you a bunch ‚Äì she still has done very little for you from an objective standpoint. Just because you are thrilled to have a pretty girl text you does not mean she deserves a text back ‚Äì she needs to do something to deserve it first.¬†

Humans evolved to view relationships as reciprocal exchanges, so if somebody proves themselves to be a fair and valuable trading partner we feel a deep emotional connection to them. Not only do we value the fruits of the exchange, but we also view the trading partner‚Äôs life as an extension to our own such and vicariously feel their joys and victories because we are helping them win and they are helping us win. Our subconscious mind keeps a tally of everything we have done for them and everything they have done for us, which is why we feel angry and betrayed when we do something for a person and they do not reciprocate.

But here is the strange thing: we also feel disgusted and repelled by people who do too much stuff for us we do not deserve. When people do things we have done nothing to deserve, we subconsciously feel we have incurred a debt we must repay. Our subconscious mind knows nobody does anything for free and somehow ‚Äúknows‚Äù that the doer wants and expects something back. The feeling that somebody is fixated on you because they want and expect something from you is unpleasant, and we seek to escape that pressure by escaping from the person. This is why women often lose attraction if you ask them for things, beg, express disappointment when they say no, and give her stuff for nothing in return: their lizard mind senses that have emotionally invested in her and want something, and will stop at nothing to get it. And the truth is: her lizard mind is right: no matter how much you consciously say to yourself ‚ÄúI am just a nice, generous guy‚Äù your subconscious mind wants something from her and you will get mad if you do not get it.

Because of our subconscious propensity to view relationships as reciprocal trading exchanges, we emotionally invest in people after we do things for them. Person A may think person B is attractive, but person A won‚Äôt really emotionally care about person B until person A does things for person B. When I was in college, my guidance counselor suggested I apply to Yale Law School. I laughed ‚Äì I knew my grades were not good enough but I applied anyway just to see what would happen. Before I applied to Yale, I had not cared about getting in, but the act of applying made me emotionally invest in Yale so I got very upset after I got rejected. The same thing happens with women ‚Äì even if the woman shows you no interest at all, by doing things for her (even just texting her), you emotionally invest in her such that you get angry when she does not text back.

Most guys, of course, assume the opposite: they think if they do things for a woman first, she will like them more. But for the reasons I described earlier, doing undeserved favors actually repels women. The strange thing is that women may ask for these favors and even think with their rational mind they want them, but when you actually do these favors, their subconscious starts to produce a bad feeling about you, but she will eventually leave if the bad feeling grows large enough.

Whenever you are feeling emotional, irrational, insecure, or anxious around a woman, take a second to rationally analyze the interaction as a reciprocal exchange. Are you doing more for her than she is doing for you? Are you texting her more than she is texting you? Are you staring at her when she is not doing anything to merit being stared at? Are you waiting for her or doing favors for her when she has not done the same for you? Are you divulging deep secrets about your life when she is not doing the same? Because men naturally tend to emotionally overinvest in women, you should constantly be adjusting your behavior and attention to ensure that the interaction is a reciprocal exchange.

Women deeply want to form an emotional connection with the alpha male, vicariously experience his awesome life and gain access to his protection and resources ‚Äì in other words, they want acceptance into his life. The alpha male grants this acceptance by paying the woman attention: women subconsciously know that a man‚Äôs attention is proportional to his emotional investment, and a man‚Äôs emotional investment in a woman is proportional to his acceptance of her. But again, if a man emotionally overinvests in a woman, she will not want his acceptance because she will have incurred a debt she must repay later.

Women feel more comfortable in relationships where the man has not deeply emotionally invested in them. If you do things for a woman only after she does things for you, you let her control the amount of attention she gets. If she wants attention, she can do things for you ‚Äì if she does not want attention, she can turn it off by not doing things. This, by the way, is how you get women to ‚Äúchase‚Äù you ‚Äì by only rewarding her post hoc, she can further the relationship on her own terms. But if you do stuff for her first, you are emotionally investing in her and pressuring her into reciprocating, and nobody likes to be pressured. It sounds strange, but part of the reason women sometimes like men who ignore them is because those men are not pressuring them ‚Äì the woman can jump in and out of the relationship whenever they please because the man does not give a fuck whether she is there or not. Of course at some point, you may want to enter into a long-term relationship with a woman who consistently contributes, but to do so you must find a woman who wants to consistently contribute and will always be more emotionally invested than you. ¬†¬†¬†

Women have a very keen sense of their own value and a subconscious ‚Äúattention sensor‚Äù which tells them why they are receiving attention. The moment the attention sensor senses that you are doing things for she has not worked for, it throws up a red flag and she starts looking for the exits. Womens‚Äô attention sensor is extremely sensitive and largely irrational. If you are a successful, attractive guy with a fun life, it will not actually hurt you to bestow upon a random woman a free drink or a few minutes of attention. But to her subconscious lizard mind, even that little bit of undeserved attention indicates disproportionate emotional investment. This is why even a little bit of extra attention creeps women out.

**Why Creepiness Sucks**

Emotional overinvestment is unattractive for a variety of reasons, a few of which I describe here. ¬†

First, when you emotionally overinvest in a woman, you usually subconsciously know something is wrong, so you start to censor yourself and act strangely. It is almost like your subconscious mind knows you are being creepy, so it tries to hide your real emotions and stop you from what you are doing. This is why creepy people are often anxious and are somehow ‚Äúoff‚Äù ‚Äì their subconscious mind is trying to stop them from expressing their creepiness. But it is extremely difficult to hide your real emotions, so women can tell something is off because your words and actions are not congruent with your emotional state. Humans have a deep aversion to people who are non-congruent like this because we can sense they have some ulterior motive against us (because they do).

A confident, non-creepy man is congruent: his actions, thoughts and emotions align, and he feels no guilt, shame, or anxiety in a how he feels because he is not worried he is doing anything wrong. In a weird way, he is like an open book: when he says or does something, you do not need to worry he is lying or has some ulterior motive. But to be congruent you must first feel free to express yourself, and creeps do not feel free to express themselves because on some weird level they know their emotional state is wrong.

Second, emotional overinvestment just feels bad. If you‚Äôve ever been obsessed with a girl or heartbroken over a breakup, you know that feeling sucks. You feel weak, inferior, dependent, anxious, and sometimes even depressed, lonely, or angry. Instead of focusing on your life‚Äôs mission and the things you that bring you happiness, you are focusing on a person who may or may not give a shit about you. An advantage of the alpha male quid pro quo is that your own emotions will tell you if you are doing it right: if your actions make you feel clear-headed, alpha, and strong you are doing it right. If your actions are making you feel weak, beta, and anxious, you are doing it wrong. If you text a girl and afterwards and move on to do the next thing, you are doing it right. If you text a girl and afterwards feel anxious and keep thinking about her like you may have done something wrong, you are doing it wrong.

Third, emotional overinvestment oftentimes becomes a vicious spiral. We emotionally overinvest in a girl, so we do things for she does not deserve, which causes us to feel even more emotionally invested, which causes us to do even more for her, etc‚Ä¶ And the more we become emotionally invested, the less attracted she becomes, so the less she does for us, which causes in turn to do more to ‚Äúget her back.‚Äù This vicious spiral is why some guys end up in jail for stalking the McDonald‚Äôs cashier when all she ever did was smile at them. We have all felt ourselves slipping into this vicious spiral at some point in our lives, which is why we become so horrified when see it in somebody else, especially when that person has emotionally overinvested in us. Because creepy people feel scarcity, they feel desperation, and extreme desperation is scary because it means you might do something crazy or violent to get the thing you want

If you knew a homeless man was starving and has not eaten in over two weeks, you would not walk by him with a sandwich because you would know he might do something crazy to get the sandwich from you. Not only would your rational brain logically know that he might become violent over the sandwich, but your emotions would also ‚Äúfeel‚Äù uneasy around him because we all subconsciously know how it feels to be desperate, and we can sense it in others. For the same reason, women do not like to be around creepy guys because they know those creepy guys might become annoying, stalkerish, or even violent. If a man acts even a tiny bit creepy, women can sense it and are repelled because their primitive lizard mind knows that that tiny bit of creepiness can blossom into something seriously creepy later.¬†

I have noticed that needy, insecure, and codependent people are more likely to be disgusted by people who emotionally overinvest in them than average people. I suspect this is because needy people are themselves more likely to fall into this vicious spiral of neediness, so seeing even a little neediness in others makes them assume the other person will fall into this vicious spiral as well. I suspect this is why women with ‚Äúdaddy issues‚Äù cannot stay in stable relationships: they are quick to emotionally overinvest in men, but the moment a man emotionally invests in them they freak out. The only way to ‚Äútame‚Äù a woman with daddy issues is to enforce the alpha male quid pro quo strictly, which most men cannot do.

Fourth, emotional overinvestment is unattractive because it subconsciously indicates to her that your emotional experience sucks. Women are constantly monitoring where a man is directing his thoughts and emotions, and if that man is emotionally overinvesting in people and things that provide him nothing in return, she will subconsciously feel like his life is not attractive. Think about it: if you are starving and talk about eating sandwiches for 8 hours a day, people with well-rounded lives are not going to enjoy being around you. Instead, they will feel sad and annoyed by you. In addition, women have a very keen sense of their own value, and if they feel like they are providing you little value but you are emotionally overinvesting in them, then they subconsciously assume the rest of your life has little value as well. This feeling is sometimes irrational, because giving women a little extra attention does not mean your life actually sucks, but the lizard mind is irrational.

Fifth, emotional overinvestment in somebody indicates that you are beneath them in the subconscious dominance hierarchy we all carry around in our heads. The dominance hierarchy stays together because the lower-ranked apes emotionally invest in the higher-ranked ones and do things for them, so if somebody emotionally over-invests in you, you subconsciously assume they are beneath you in the dominance hierarchy. People‚Äôs perceptions of the dominance hierarchy are completely irrational ‚Äì if a billionaire does too much for a homeless woman, she may feel ‚Äúhigher‚Äù than him even though in reality she is not.

In addition, it feels bad when you realize you are occupying all of a person‚Äôs thoughts and emotions, because if you slip up and do the wrong thing they will become extremely angry and upset. Counter-intuitively, when you know that you are competing with other stuff for their thoughts and emotions, you feel less pressure. Of course, sometimes very insecure or weak people hold their nose and stay in relationships with people that are too emotionally invested in them because they prefer the shitty feeling of being pressured to the shitty feeling of being alone. And of course, sometimes women hold their nose and stay with men that are overly emotionally invested because they want money, a nice house to live in, social status, etc‚Ä¶

By the way, women can get emotionally overinvested too. In fact, when women emotionally overinvest in men, it is often much worse, which is why women get freaked out so much by men who emotionally overinvest ‚Äì they know the feeling! I have always been surprised by how I get turned off by women who are too into me. I have had really hot and cool chicks blow it with me because they did way too much. On some level, I think I was afraid that I was feeding their craziness and if I didn‚Äôt dismiss them I would end up in a cage in their basement.

**What can women do for you?**

Women can ‚Äúdo‚Äù a lot of things for you: teach you something, entertain you, do errands for you, compliment you, buy you something, or simply contribute to a good conversation. The only criteria is that she must meaningfully and objectively contribute to your life. Texting you, complimenting you, and just being hot are contributions, but they are very mild contributions, and don‚Äôt deserve much in return. If a woman gets in a car and comes to meet you at a bar, it is ok to buy her a drink, but if she is just standing at the bar looking hot, then no.

To understand women‚Äôs contributions in a more abstract way, think of it like this: women contribute by helping you pursue your purposes, whatever they may be, and your purposes ideally involve venturing into the unknown, conquering some challenge, and bringing back some resource to share with those that have helped you. The more a woman ‚Äúhelps‚Äù you in your purposes, and the more important of the purpose she helps you with, the more she deserves. For example, a woman that helps you get a job at a company you want to work for is contributing way more than a woman who buys you a beer. And most importantly, women should help you pursue your purposes, not BE your purpose.

Most men fail the alpha male quid pro quo by doing too much for the woman. But some men fail because they do not do enough. If a woman DOES meaningfully contribute to your emotional experience, you should reward her proportionately to what she has done. Women seek acceptance, and if they feel like they cannot get it from you they will move on and get it from somebody else. A woman may be intrigued by a man who ignores her, but she will not want to remain ignored forever ‚Äì at some point she will want acceptance from somebody, even if he is not her first choice. This is a very important point ‚Äì women are VERY sensitive to rejection and the phrase ‚Äúhell hath no fury like a woman scorned‚Äù is true ‚Äì if a woman feels like you have affirmatively rejected her, she will never be able to trust you again because evolutionarily, rejection means that you left the woman in the woods by herself to starve.

The key to getting women to do things for you is to be very warm and welcoming so she feels comfortable putting herself out there. Women are terrified of rejection, so you must make her feel comfortable doing things and emotionally investing in you. You must also fairly reward her for her contributions to keep her feeling welcome to do things for you.

It is often difficult to determine what exactly is ‚Äúfair‚Äù because it is impossible for you to accurately keep track of every single thing you have done for each other. As a man, you are also prone to emotionally overinvest in a woman, especially at the beginning stages of the interaction. Therefore, to be safe, you should do significantly less for her than she does for you, but not so little that she feels rejected. Getting good at this requires practice and ‚Äúfeel‚Äù ‚Äì I can‚Äôt tell you what would be fair in every situation.

The more the woman emotionally invests in you, the easier it becomes to maintain the alpha male quid pro quo because she will constantly be doing stuff for you and she will build up a large ‚Äúaccount‚Äù that you will be able to draw against without going negative. Women WANT to do things for men they are attracted to, and indeed your challenge will be to reward her fairly. But women normally take longer than men to emotionally invest, so you need to very cognizant of the alpha male quid pro quo in the beginning stages of the relationship, including when you first meet her. ¬†

**Escalation**

Escalation is just a process you reward her for emotionally investing in you. The more she emotionally invests in you, the more she will feel attracted, and the more she will expect and desire for you to ‚Äúescalate‚Äù by paying her attention, inviting her to do things, and making sexual advances. The key to escalating, however, is waiting until AFTER she has emotionally invested, which means you should wait until after she has done things for you.

Here is an example:

1. She does something small for you (she gets dolled up and looking hot to go out that night).
2. You reward her with a proportionate amount of attention (you walk up to her and say ‚Äúyou look amazing tonight‚Äù)
3. She does something bigger for you (she smiles and says thank you)
4. You reward her with more attention and escalation (you ask what is your name)
5. Etc‚Ä¶

As the night goes on, the stakes get bigger and bigger. So later, for example she contributes by having a long conversation about something interesting, and you ‚Äúreward‚Äù her for complimenting and then inviting to do something with you later. It does not matter exactly what you do, it just has to be proportionate to what she has done.

At some point you may accidentally press the gas too hard and show her too much attention or escalate too quickly, causing her to recoil or say no. That‚Äôs fine. Just act like nothing happened, withdraw your attention, and wait until she emotionally invests later. For example, let‚Äôs say you try to kiss her and she says no. You laugh, say something to show it‚Äôs not a big deal (‚Äúhey I tried‚Äù) and immediately go back to whatever you were doing as if nothing happened. Then later in the night when she is ready you can try again. When you get good at this, you will be able to ‚Äúread‚Äù women and tell when they are ready for the next step, but until then, it‚Äôs just practice.

At any point she may stop contributing, walk away, do something shitty, etc.. In that case, you should just withdraw your attention and ‚Äúget distracted‚Äù by something else. Oftentimes I will approach a woman at a party and when the conversation starts to go stale I wander away and come back later. You should not get butthurt, ‚Äúcall her out,‚Äù or complain ‚Äì you should act like a little child that got distracted by some other shiny thing, so she feels like you have lots of options and do not get when one of your options poops out for some reason. You should remember that women take a while to emotionally invest in men, so if a woman ignores you or does not show you interest right away, it does not necessarily mean that she has something against you ‚Äì you may have just not shown your life to be fun enough to yet.

Of course, sometimes women just do not like you, no matter how well you execute the alpha male quid pro quo. Or they may be shitty people that actively want to harm your life or take advantage of you. In those cases, it is fine to just withdraw your attention.

**Beginning the relationship**

If you have been following my logic so far, you may be thinking ‚Äúif I were to follow the alpha male quid pro quo strictly, I would never approach or escalate with a new woman because they would not have done anything for me. This would make it impossible for me to meet women because most women do not make the first move.‚Äù This is actually an important point.

No matter what a woman has done for you, all women merit you approaching them once. Just the fact that they left the house, put some pants on, and tried to make themselves look pretty is enough of a ‚Äúcontribution‚Äù to merit you saying hello and introducing yourself. When women are getting ready to go out, they are dolling themselves up to impress the ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù ‚Äì they just do not know it is you yet. Of course, once you have introduced yourself, the onus is back on her to do something to merit more and deeper attention from you. But every woman gets one free approach. Not a drink, not a conversation, just a warm, friendly, approach.

Even if you don‚Äôt buy my alpha male quid pro quo theory, you should still feel comfortable approaching people because a pure approach by itself is never creepy. What makes it creepy is staring at her too long, sticking around after she has shown she is not interested in talking to you, etc‚Ä¶ But approaching is a normal part of human interaction and is necessary for people to ever meet. Blue haired feminists that say you should never approach a woman are just stupid ‚Äì they are confining themselves to a prison where the only people they will ever meet are friends of friends. ¬†

The purpose of an approach is to communicate ‚ÄúI am warm, friendly, and welcoming enough to give you the chance to validate yourself to me.‚Äù Women are very sensitive to rejection, which is why they are so afraid to approach men they find attractive. Think of a tribe as hierarchy ‚Äì the alpha male sits at the top of the hierarchy and the status of the individual members is determined by the alpha depending on what they have done for the tribe. The losers and enemies of the tribe sit outside of the tribe‚Äôs walls ‚Äì they are excluded from the hierarchy completely. When you approach women, you subconsciously communicate ‚ÄúYou can enter the walls of the tribe, but if you want to move up, you need to work for it.‚Äù And by the way, you should never ‚Äúreject‚Äù a woman unless you are absolutely sure that your rejection is permanent. 

I once joined a very prestigious law firm famous for being a meat grinder. They would hire 70-80 new lawyers a year but only about 4 or 5 would last long enough to actually make partner. During my second week, the firm‚Äôs most important partner approached me and asked me about a case I was working on. Despite my nervousness, the partner was very warm and friendly. And I can still remember like yesterday him responding to something I said by saying ‚Äúgreat ‚Äì now you‚Äôre thinking like a partner.‚Äù

Of course, that‚Äôs bullshit. I wasn‚Äôt even close to being a partner ‚Äì I was just another slab of meat for the meat grinder. And like most lawyers the firm hired, I would probably not last long enough to become partner. If I fucked up he could fire me and give my work to one of the other 70 lawyers he had hired that year. But in that moment, the firm‚Äôs most important partner made me feel like I had a legitimate shot at succeeding in this law firm. And really, that‚Äôs the whole point of every approach ‚Äì you are trying to subconsciously communicate to the woman that she has a genuine chance at joining your awesome life if she does a good job. The CEO walking up and shaking your hand does not mean that you are guaranteed to move up, but it least means you are not fired. And when you approach women, you should act as if the new hire is naturally eager to validate themselves to the CEO.

Additionally, to address this paradox you must realize that as the alpha male, it is your job to ‚Äúfind‚Äù what the woman can meaningfully contribute to your emotional experience. Women often have a lot to contribute, but you need to draw it out of them. A lot of women that look hot, plain, or boring on the outside actually have a lot of interesting thoughts and abilities and a strong desire to put herself at the service of an attractive man. If you are confident and creative enough, you can find something about almost any woman that she can contribute and that will merit you giving her attention and compliments. Think about it this way: the more you can get her to contribute, the more attention you can justify paying her. Of course, some women cannot and do not want to contribute anything to you, and that‚Äôs fine ‚Äì you can just move on.

You can ‚Äúdraw out‚Äù what is interesting about a woman with targeted questions: the purpose is not to do an interview, but to find something about her that is fun and interesting she can share so you can both explore it together. For example, if you approach a woman and compliment her dress or something, you can follow it up by saying something like ‚Äúbut are you as interesting as you are hot?‚Äù Yes, that sounds corny, but it actually taps into a deep desire that every human being has: the desire to feel appreciated for some value.

**Be Bipolar**

Of course, in the real world random women you approach do not always immediately see you as the CEO they are trying to impress. In the real world women have no idea who you are and may have no desire whatsoever to talk to you. In the real world sometimes the intern says to the CEO ‚Äúeww gross, get the fuck out of my face.‚Äù But nevertheless, you should still act as if you are the CEO warmly giving a brand new intern a shot at proving themselves. Humans see all relationships as power relationships, so the alternative to acting like the CEO is acting like a loser begging for her validation (or more abstractly, a loser begging for entrance into the tribe‚Äôs walls), which women are not attracted to.

Therefore, to successfully implement the alpha male quid pro quo you must sometimes act somewhat bipolar. You approach a woman with warmth and kindness but the moment she does not reciprocate you shift to your attention elsewhere as if she does not exist. You may need to leave a conversation mid-sentence without saying a word if she is not being pleasant. You may need to leave a date that was going well because it started going south. You may need to stare at a woman blankly or suddenly remember that you needed to call your uncle when she asks you to do something she does not deserve from you. ¬†

Being bipolar is hard for many reasons. First, it just feels weird and is a change from how you normally act. Usually when you like somebody you continue to like them even if they start being a little shitty or distant ‚Äì but being bipolar requires you to immediately do a 360. The hardest part of being bipolar is taking yourself out of the emotional flow of the interaction to do the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing ‚Äì you may be having a great time with a woman but still need to pump the brakes if she is trying to take more than she is giving. Being bipolar is also hard because women will beg, plead, and even cry for you to do things for them they do not deserve. They will threaten to leave, shame you, insult you, and try to make you jealous. It does not matter. You cannot give in. You must follow the alpha male quid pro quo. They themselves do not realize that they are begging for you to do something that will make them lose respect for you.

The key to being bipolar is to see yourself as an unemotional observer that pays women attention for their objective contributions, and not because of your own feelings. A good way to get acclimated to this new way of thinking is to commit to complimenting any woman you see who deserves a compliment: just make the compliment, smile, and leave. Some women may assume you are just another creep trying to fuck them, but once they see you really just wanted to pay a compliment they will appreciate it. As I stated earlier, understanding this stuff should make you MORE likely to approach, not less. ¬†

Because implementing the alpha male quid pro quo is so unnatural and outside the normal way people act, at first you will feel strange, uncomfortable, or like you are being an asshole. And superficially you will actually appears to some people as being an asshole. But the alpha male quid pro quo ""works"" because it taps into something deep and primal about human beings: the feeling that we only deserve attention in proportion to what we have done.

By the way, when a woman does not contribute, you should not feel butthurt or angry, nor should you ever ‚Äúcall women out.‚Äù ‚Äì you should just move on. You should be like a happy retard running to whatever seems most interesting and fun at that moment. If a woman rejects or ignores you, just bounce to the next one like nothing happened.

**Why Men Emotionally Overinvest**

Of course, this is all easier said than done because most men, especially in modern society, emotionally overinvest in women. This partly occurs for three reasons:

**1) Men evolved to emotionally invest in women quicker because women are looking for a long-term mate.**

Men evolved to impregnate as many women as possible in a short as time as possible. Women, however, evolved to seek a mate who will be reliable over the long term to protect and provide for the child over a period of years. Therefore, women have a longer list of criteria that a potential mate needs to meet and require a longer ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù period to determine whether the man is worth being sexually attracted to. Men, however, often become emotionally invested in a woman just by seeing she is hot.

As a practical matter, this means that most men blow it with women because they do something needy right at the beginning of the interaction. The moment they see a hot woman they decide to buy her a drink, do her a favor, or pay her more attention she deserves, which causes the woman to immediately eliminate them from consideration. This also causes the man to text too much, overshare, or feel like he has a closer emotional connection with her than he really does.

There is, however, a silver lining here. Once you realize that most men are eliminated from the jump, you can immediately set yourself apart by strictly implementing the alpha male quid pro quo. You just need to control your emotions. As a red-blooded American male, when I see a hot chick walking down the street my first impulse is to follow her home so I can tell her I want to eat ice cream out of her ass. But because I know about the alpha male quid pro quo, I restrain myself.

"The modern use of the word... ""simp""","Everyone's heard it. You're a simp. He's a simp. She's a simp. Maybe you get freaked out by hearing it ""Holy shit, is everyone RP aware now? Wow!!!"" nope. Simp is an interesting word, how its overused &amp; misused by people is even more interesting.

99% of young people 17 &amp; under completely misuse the term simp... and still even if you get into the young adult bracket of college and early 20s, I would say more than half of them misuse it, more than 90% when it comes to girls using it (new shaming tactic, the new **YOU'RE NOT A REAL MAN!!!** of the 1950s - 2010s) As always, ignore everything women say, only their actions/intentions/narratives matter.

A simp is a man who puts women on a pedestal. Simple enough? A simp is a man who will be really nice to a women expecting sex or some other types of favors in return, and be bitter or upset or angry if its never received.

However, to the mainstream norm the definition is: **A simp is a man who will be really nice to a women**

Being kind or friendly to a women, helping them just because it makes you feel good and you don't lose anything from it doesn't make you a simp. If you have 0 interest in getting sexual with them now or in the future why do so many people care if you're nice to her? Being a decent human being as opposed to selfish &amp; cold to all women, especially those you don't have any sexual relationship with simply because they're women... doesn't make you a simp. In fact i'd argue we need a new term for the psychology of this age, *because anyone who cares so much about women and views reality through this perspective - that they have to treat all women they interact with in life a certain way &amp; avoid seeming nice at all cost, is indeed a simp.* That's giving them too much power, too much importance, putting them on a pedestal... when they should have absolutely 0 power or influence in your decisions. An anti-simp? Yes I like that, just like an anti-hero, you're still a hero... just in another way.

All the people who call people simps irl? Are indeed... simps, and blue pill mindset. Thus proving TRP isn't mainstream. So now you see the truth, lets dig further... we now know most people who use the word simp have no idea of the true meaning or purpose behind the word. It's not to define a guy a label, **its to define a mindset**, a way of thinking that a guy has. Therefore you can't determine a man to be a simp through one or even 10 different actions, you have to closely examine the intent, agenda, purpose &amp; motive behind the actions. Who is this guy really? How is his default operating system like?

Also it shouldn't be ignored, female simps exist too. But what do you mean!? Females get sex from the guy all the time &amp; really easily, how can they be simps? **They're not simps for sex, they're simps for commitment, LTRs, and ultimately marriage.** The things high value men gate keep. Sadly the female simp is a lot more dangerous, because they're women they believe they have so much privilege &amp; power that they can just force a guy to be truly in love with them, due to society they received so much validation for simply being a woman they believe as long as they're super nice to a guy &amp; do everything they possibly can to make his life better... he will be in love with them. Unfortunately love doesn't work that way at all, in fact being a female simp demonstrates to the guy that he's much higher value, even if he's super beta in lifestyle &amp; frame he knows he can find a much better women to LTR &amp; marry than the female simp now. Attraction ruined forever, true love with that woman is forever dead with the man, and he wants to search for a better women who knows how to be sexy &amp; generate love while still compromising her value, without simping. The female simp will feel entitled to you, the high value man, your time, your affection, your love, your money your status your quality lifestyle your friends your apartment/condo/house/car... your something. She will do all she can to keep what she has ""earned"" for fucking you or being so ""friendly"" to you, and lash out in a toxic manner if you deny her things. Or get upset about seemingly nothing, start arguments, conflict &amp; tension from thin air.

This is furthered by the fact... **women aren't told to improve themselves nearly as much as guys**. They're told only to improve their outer beauty, their physical appearance. If they party, drink, love drama, tattoos, tinder, tik tik etc etc literally a million degenerate things they're unwilling to change?

For a guy, if a women doesn't like him initially or doesn't like something about him in the relationship he's just told the same thing again &amp; again... improve, improve, improve. Most guys who have been consistently doing this for years eventually realize the truth - they're already good enough, in fact they're more than fucking good enough for 90%+ of non fat women in this western society. They're the prize. It's just a matter of staying in that cycle of growth, for confidence, power, to get to or more easily conquer the women they consider to be hb 8s, 9s, and god forbid---- 10s.

Its okay, a lot of newbie RP guys fall into this trap, our whole society is beginning to be built on putting women on pedestals with the dominance of social media, tik tok, dating apps. In frustration and despair, everyone will throw around ""simp"" ironically, or maybe unironically not knowing that they themselves are indeed simps... and value women above themselves.",16,1
Escalating a Tinder Match for a Direct-to-Home Lay,"Now that girls are settling into new apartments and getting back to school, the next item on the agenda is obtaining some good dick. Experienced fuck boys can attest that  there is a seasonal aspect to dating apps, with September and October being prime months for scoring Tinder poon.

As I wrote in my post ""Why You Aren't Translating Your Tinder Matches/Dates Into Lays,"" most of you make Tinder way more complicated than it has to be.  Here I will briefly review how to tell when a girl just wants some dick, and how to escalate appropriately for an easy same night lay.

**She Just Wants Dick**

It isn't difficult to tell when she's looking for dick that very night. Most guys take curt, one-word replies to mean lack of interest on her part. **Wrong.** Oftentimes, it just means she wants you to get to the fucking point already. As long as she's responding promptly to your messages and not waiting hours in between, then you should be escalating quickly in turn. ABC - Always Be Closing.

Here is an actual example from last week:

*Start time: 6:30 PM*

**Me:** Hey \[Name\]

*7:30 PM*

**Her:** Hey Psychological Radish

**Me:** Hows it going

*She's responding within 1-5 minutes now*

**Her:** Kinda bored at home

**Me:** Sounds like we could both use some company

**Her:** Agreed

**Me:** Got wine?

**Her:** You bring one

**Me:** What part of \[City\] do you live in?

**Her:** Downtown

**Me:** I could come at 9. What's your address?

**Her:** \[gives address\]

**Me:** Cool I'll message you when I head out

*End time: 8:30 PM*

That's it, fellas. It's really that simple. No cute one liners, no crass jokes, no bullshit. Straight to the point, but without sounding like a sex-crazed weirdo. You might think this is some one-off, but I can show you many Tinder conversations that went exactly like this and ended with an effortless lay.

The execution is quite simple. I open with ""Hey \[name\]"", which she usually parrots back. I ask what's up; usually, it's ""nothing much"" or some variation. If it's a generic reply like that, I'll hit her with the ""sounds like we could both use some company"" line followed by ""got wine?""

If she says she's smoking weed and watching TV or some other activity that sounds fun, I'll invite myself to join her. Whatever the case, if she agrees, then you're pretty much in. Just pivot to logistics and seal the deal.

**Wine or Weed**

""Want sum fuck?"" isn't going to work unless you're Chad Thundercock himself, and even then it still probably won't work a lot of the time. Notice how I never actually mention sex; we both know exactly what this is, it doesn't need to be said. The medium is the message here. Still, it's important to leave her a shred of dignity and suggest meeting for wine or weed.

**Logistics**

In this example she tells me to bring the wine, which I took as an implicit invitation.  In fact, once you've gotten this far, she'll usually invite you over. Girls feel more comfortable with this sort of debauchery in their own homes, and she wouldn't even be on Tinder in the first place if she wasn't. In the event that logistics don't sort themselves out naturally, I'll invite her over with the caveat that we can also meet at her place.

**Fool's Gold**

Girls that open with shit like ""hey cutie ;)"" usually aren't serious about meeting. Chicks that bring up sex stuff in the chat probably won't actually fuck you. Not that they *never* do, but most of the time that is unfortunately the case.

It's the girls who seem the most disinterested that are often the most interested in getting some dick that very night. Indeed, many of these girls tell me later on that they downloaded the app within the last 24 hours. It behooves you to move quickly so someone like me doesn't fuck her first. Don't be discouraged by the charade. In person, these girls are often perfectly pleasant. 

Of course, YMMV and all that - this is just my experience. Obviously your pictures need to be on point. A shirtless or muscle tank top shot is basically mandatory. Plenty of guides have been written on that already.

Not every girl is going to be open to having a strange man come straight to her place, fuck the shit out her, and then leave. But many of them are, and it pays to recognize when she's looking for that and move quickly to capitalize on the opportunity.",101,1
The Sheep Dog's Intro to Situational Awareness,"**Introductory Notes**

Maybe I've outgrown this sub, but lately I've noticed an abundance of low quality posts that talk about building power and giving lame advice like carrying a damn notebook, as well as field reports about accomplishing basic human behaviours like dancing with a girl, talking to a girl, and even hooking up with one.

I thought, *why don't* ***I*** *bring some value to the group, and give back to those whose shoulders I stood upon from the OG TRP days to become the man I am now.* So here I am taking ownership of that and delivering you some good content.

**Let's Begin.**

The Sheep Dog breed is a Protector. And we find them across society in various roles, from Police &amp; Corrections Officers, other LEO, Military, Fire Service as well as in Security.

However, ‚ÄúHeroes come in many forms. Not all of them fighters.‚Äù

A Sheep Dog Protector, therefore, does not have to fall within these career paths. You can be a Sheep Dog Protector to your local community, to your family, and even to yourself.

This write up comes from two years experience in Private Security working in a range of roles from general security to protection to bouncing, and a year in Emergency Services, working in Private Sector Fire &amp; Rescue.

**What most discussions about situational awareness fails to recognise:**

The conventional model for situational awareness is outward-looking, whereby, we, as an individual, am practicing situational awareness of our environment.

However, I am, advocating for two elements of situational awareness with the first, instead, being situationally aware of *us* as the individual.

For instance, a Close Protection Operator‚Äôs duty is to protect an individual, their Protectee. If they instead focused on the fact that they haven‚Äôt eaten since lunch time, then their mind is taken away from the *moment* where they need to be *now.*

A Bouncer working a nightclub loses his mental acuity because his feet hurt.

We can mitigate or eliminate these distractions by planning ahead of time and ensuring we eat before the job and carry a snack on our person, maybe shop for better footwear or insoles also. But it is also more important exercise the mind to maintain its focus on the task at hand because distractions are unplanned and inevitable.

An unfocused mind is susceptible to repeating the same loop of thoughts, as well as falling into other unnecessary ones.

This is where meditation and mindfulness becomes important, and we can reconcile this spiritual concept with the world of violence.

In Just 2 Seconds by Gavin De Becker, one technique he has coined is to *SEE Suspects* because *Suspects Exist Everywhere (SEE).*

This means casting a knowing eye over people, communicating ‚ÄúI know what you‚Äôre up to.‚Äù  When you attentively assess a person as a Suspect, your attention burns  like fire in their mind but they don't know what you know or that you were just lucky. A would-be mugger would have second thoughts if they thought you knew what they were up and were ready for them.

Now Suspects may not actually exist, so we can create them out of the best candidates there in the moment. This means the same person might not actually be suspicious to us in another time and place, but because we are actively searching for Suspects we can lower our threshold for suspicion because we are not looking for Realised Threats.

If we are always looking for the real thing, we become complacent because we may never come across the real thing in our entire career. It happens.

Instead, we are looking for Opportunities for Attack, we are looking for Suspects.

‚ÄúThe goal is not to find excellent suspects ‚Äì but rather to find the best suspects among the people present‚Äù.

\*If this post takes off, I'll contribute some more content and discussion on other techniques.\*

Nevertheless, the purpose of these techniques or mental tasks is to bring the mind into focus on your task, and not to become caught up in thinking about things that don't matter.

Maybe you're upset about a stupid argument with your partner before work, and now you're replaying the whole conversation again in your mind. How can you be situationally aware of your environment if you are not situationally aware of yourself, and your body, your mental state?

**Environmental controls**

Imagine you are walking down a busy shopping mall, do you need to be situationally aware of vehicles running into you? Not necessarily. Instead, the biggest threat to you would actually be other people who are looking for an easy victim, maybe someone who accidentally bumps into you and you hurt your ankle.

How about when you go for a run throughout your neighbourhood? The biggest threat to you *now,* might actually be vehicle-borne instead of derived from another person.

Therefore, we can mentally manipulate our environment to our advantage. In our above example, we can mentally manipulate our environment to give us one less thing to worry about, giving us more processing power to remain situationally aware by realizing that a passing vehicle is *not* something worth paying attention to, and that by extension, any person on the other side of the road presents a lower risk to you.

For a Firefighter manning the pumps, he can selectively ignore the fire and damaged structure, such that anything outside of the Rig doesn‚Äôt exist to him. He can keep situationally aware on the smaller environment he has created for himself. Make your world smaller. Make your environment smaller so that you can control it better, at least in your imagination.

But there may be instances whereby, you *can* control your environment.

For a Bouncer, this might mean standing on the balcony overlooking a crowd or finding some other highground to stand above the crowd instead of overwatch. For the Doorman, they don‚Äôt need to be as focused on watching people in line because only the people in front present any risk.

The point to making these controls whether imagined or real is to allow us to selectively filter what is important and what isn‚Äôt. Therefore, when we need to assess a real threat, we use less processing power to make that assessment.

**A discussion on a particular tactic (one of many scanning techniques)**

360 degree awareness is what we want to maintain. The problem is that many people try to take in a wide-scope snapshot of their environment at a glance. This is like looking at a word search brain teaser where your brain looks for words that jump out at you, instead of logically searching for words grid-by-grid. Instead your eyes don‚Äôt know where to focus so it darts all over the place instead of following that logical search pattern.

Therefore, we mentally manipulate our environment so that anything you can see that is not directly in front of you doesn‚Äôt exist. Think of it like a torch shone in the dark. The beam of light is what you can see directly in front of you as far as you can see, but anything outside that beam doesn‚Äôt exist ‚Äì it‚Äôs in darkness.

Therefore, in order to see 360 degrees we might need to break that up into 6 separate scans (12, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 O'Clock positions). This means we need to physically turn your head, physically turn your body, physically move your feet in order to maintain 360 degree awareness. The physical movement aligned with eye movement allows you to focus only on what is directly in front of you as far as you can so, and not a full 180 degrees.

The other benefit to this is it overtly signals to *person-born* threats that you are practicing situational awareness, that you know what to look for, and that you are assessing their risk level. Already that lowers their risk level, because they do not see you as an easy victim.

The importance of this technique is quite clear when observing a crowd, especially when used in conjunction with what I call the *penetrative gaze.*

Imagine a Police Officer looking into a crowd, how far back can he see into the gathered masses? What about a Bouncer watching over a crowded dance floor?

Every crowd moves and sways to a rhythm. If the Police Officer were to take in a 180-degree snapshot of the crowd, there is too much stimuli within his field of view for his eyes to take in at once. That‚Äôs already established. However, by scanning his field of view in sections he will be able to penetrate past the first row, past the second, past the third and so forth instead of simply seeing only the first row if it was 180 degree glance.

Think of it like a pendulum swing. When the pendulum is in the bottom of the swing, our view is blocked. But as it moves past, we can now see what was behind it previously.

In real life, this works because people shift their bodyweight from leg to leg, so as they lean away, and you can now see behind them. Maybe the second person behind him, then bends down to tie their shoelace. Now you can see behind them into the third row.

Maybe the third person notices you watching them, and now self-conscious they look away and turn their body angling away from you, so now you can see past them into the fourth row ‚Äì and so forth.

On the dance floor it's easier, because as people move and sway, they rhythmically move in and out of the way of each other that you could see past and beyond them, penetrating your gaze deeper into the crowd.

**What all this means for the Average Joe Citizen?**

These techniques will keep you safe, but let's think about how they apply to everyday life.

How can you enjoy your night out with your friends if your head is somewhere else? Be present and mindful to be in the *now.*

Maybe you're being downtrodden by all the negative thoughts in your head? Give yourself, your mind a task to focus on and something to focus on. Make a small win and build upon that.

Physically control what you can and don't worry about what you can't. Maybe you're 5'5'', so what that you won't ever be 6 foot tall. Hit the gym and control your physique. Learn about style and grooming.

Maybe you're training for a fight, and you've exhausted everything you can physically control. Mentally manipulate yourself and your environment for a win. Let's continue on with you being 5'5'' set to fight against a 6 foot opponent. You mentally manipulate that situation to win by thinking, *I've had to work so hard on building my strength and working on my technique to get here. This guy hasn't had to work as hard as me. That means he doesn't have the heart to fight because he's never struggled as much as me.*

Let's say you're going through selection for SOF, SWAT, CERT etc, and now you're struggling, you're wondering how you'll make it through the next few weeks or months of selection? Make your world small. Focus only on what is in front of you. Make it through the next set. Don't worry about the session 10 weeks into the future. Focus on making this next set the best set. Don't think of it as 10 more days of selection, think of it as 10 opportunities to see the sunrise and earn the day.

Let's finish by saying that you're on a particular career path or decision and now you suddenly have post-decision regret. Use penetrative gazing to see through all the bullshit and remember why you were there. You'll stay the course.

**Know the way, and see it in all things. That's from Musashi.**

Holding your frame /standing up against bigger guys. What would you do in this case?,"In an attempt to improve myself, I'm writing down all my flaws and attempting to fix them one by one. One of my flaws is : inability to stand up to guys physically bigger and larger than myself.

Here's a real situation which happened to me 3 years ago. I was in a dance studio, talking to a female friend. We were standing on the left side of the room, while the entire right side is fully empty.

This guy, about 1.5 heads taller than me, came out from nowhere, stood behind me, tap on my right shoulder, his eyes looking straight ahead, didn't say a single word and used his hand to gesture ""go in front"". (you know, the hand flicking gesture you make to signal someone to go away).

Because he was taller, bigger and stronger, I immediately complied like a total wuss. I immediately lost frame and obeyed like a dog. I paused my convo with my friend and walked in front as he gestured.

Now, thinking back, I'm trying to figure out what would I have done if a similar situation were to happen to me again.

I thinking of this:

1) Call him out by telling him factually that I stood there first, the entire right side of the room is empty so he can move over there

Problem is: if he gets physical (which is quite likely considering that he's a douchebag), I'm gonna be fucked. I can have all the frame in the world but without physical power to back that up, it's nothing. I go to the gym, but here's the thing : no matter how large I become, there'll always be guys larger than me. Same for learning MMA or Muay Thai. Sure, I might beat him, but what if he asks 6 of his friends to hunt me down next week? No martial arts can take on 6 guys at the same time.

So I guess my question is : to be a manly man with a strong frame, how would you behave, if a guy like Eddie Hall or Kali Muscle tries to bully you and jerk you around? Would you still call him out, or obey him without question, while the rest of the folks are watching you get bullied?",169,1

Theory of Status Portfolios,"Hey all. I‚Äôve been here a few years now and have gotten a lot of benefit out of this community. I want to share how I conceptualize some of what I learned here. I recently read ‚ÄúThe Intelligent Investor‚Äù by Benjamin Graham (by that I mean I only read like half of it because I‚Äôm a lazy fuck). I think the idea of using a portfolio to minimize risk and maximize chances of success can also apply to our subreddit, but with returns in the sexual marketplace instead of the financial one. 

Status is defined as ‚Äúthe relative social, professional, or other standing of someone or something.‚Äù It‚Äôs a well established scientific fact that male reproductive success is associated with being high status within the context of your interactions with women [link] (https://www.pnas.org/content/113/39/10824). This makes sense from an evolutionary point of view. A high status man will have greater access to resources than a low status man, much like a youthful, physically fit woman will be more likely to survive childbirth and raise a child than an elderly or less fit one. 

I believe that men should view their status pursuits as assets within a portfolio. Rather than money, you are investing your time into becoming more ‚Äúfit‚Äù (in the genetic sense) than you are now. If your goal is to maximize your odds of reproductive success, the best thing you can do is acquire multiple forms of status that are valuable across many contexts. That way, if one ‚Äúasset‚Äù performs poorly in certain contexts, some other asset may pick up the slack. 

Here is an example. Say you are a lifter only. You haven‚Äôt practiced much game, haven‚Äôt worked on improving your financial situation, and don‚Äôt have any other status investments. What happens when the gyms close because of a global pandemic? Or you get into an accident and break a bone that keeps you out of the gym for a few months? Your muscles will shrivel, and your investment will be lost. 

Or say you‚Äôve prioritized education in lieu of everything else. What happens when you go from being the smartest in your high school to equally as intelligent as everyone around you at university? Or you go work for a great firm, but everyone else is just as intelligent as you are? You no longer are high status and no longer stand out. Sure, outside of the university/work you may be still seen as a big fish for where you go to school/work, but presumably you spend most of your time on campus/at work and are therefore just seen as another face. 

As a general rule, a wider diversity of ‚Äúasset classes‚Äù means greater results. It reflects the simple reality that a man with two status asset classes in his portfolio (physical fitness and game, for example) beats a man with just one. A smart dude who‚Äôs also in great shape beats a regular looking dude of similar intelligence or a guy who‚Äôs in a similar level of fitness but not that smart. The more ‚Äústatus assets‚Äù you have, the higher status you are and thus, the more evolutionarily fit you are. By investing in multiple ‚Äúasset classes‚Äù (status pursuits), you are reducing your risk and raising your odds of getting a larger return. 

For those of you familiar with portfolio management, you may be wondering about asset allocation. For those who aren‚Äôt, essentially what this means is that different assets will comprise different percentages of the portfolio. As an example, Benjamin Graham (the guy who influenced Warren Buffet, the most successful investor of all time) believed that the regular, hands off investor should take a conservative approach, which he determined to be a portfolio of 50% stocks and 50% bonds (though those numbers could skew to 75-25% either way depending on where the market was). 

So, how should we allocate our asset classes for pursuing status? I break my time down into four categories: sleep, work, free time, and personal maintenance. I sleep eight hours a night, which is 33% of my week. I work 40 hours a week (ish), so that‚Äôs nearly 25% of my time right there. I estimate that I personally spend about 25 hours per week (15%) on maintenance tasks (cooking and eating, exercising, laundry, grooming, errands, and cleaning my apartment). That leaves me with about 47 hours of free time per week (28%). Your mileage may vary on the last two, that‚Äôs just how things worked out for me. 

As a general rule, you should prioritize your physical health as much as possible. Health is the ‚Äúbonds‚Äù of your portfolio. It isn‚Äôt sexy, but it‚Äôs the lowest risk way to succeed. This includes sleeping, eating right, working out hard (lifting AND cardio), and taking care of yourself when you‚Äôre sick. I would say anywhere from 40-50% of your time should be spent focusing on that, depending on where you are in your fitness journey. A guy who‚Äôs just starting out should skew towards the higher end, while the guy who‚Äôs basically just doing maintenance at this point could skew towards the lower. I personally spend a little over 40% of my time on my physical health and appearance, between sleeping 8 hours a night (33%), grocery shopping, meal prepping healthy food, and eating a total of 10 hours a week (6%), exercising about 5 hours a week (3%), and grooming about two hours per week (1%, bringing the total to 43%). 

The other 50% should be spent on non-physical status pursuits. You have a bunch of options here, as this is like the ‚Äústocks‚Äù portion of your portfolio. However, much like not all stocks are created equally, neither are all status pursuits. Presumably, you‚Äôre working at least 40 hours per week, which means at least half that remaining 50% is going to be dedicated to work. Work is your blue chip stocks. It‚Äôs going to be the bulk of your stocks portfolio, and is likely going to generate the biggest return. Some of you may choose to work less, some more. Either is fine, so long as it‚Äôs earning you money. Gotta pay the bills somehow. Preferably, your job is also somewhat high status, and shows people that you‚Äôre intelligent (STEM), or you make **bank** (finance, sales). 

What do you do with your free time then? Socialize and get laid hopefully, but you aren‚Äôt gonna be out every night, so then what? Learn an instrument? Learn a language? Watch TV or play video games (not recommended)? The choice is yours. Be warned that some uses of free time denote status (anything involving mastery, such as learning an instrument, language, or other skill) and some do not (such as watching TV). I don‚Äôt wanna shit on watching TV, sometimes it‚Äôs nice to crack a beer and watch TV for an hour or two. Just don‚Äôt make that your ‚Äúthing‚Äù, where you‚Äôre like that guy on Family Guy who has seen every movie ever, because all he does is drink and watch TV.

"In Canada you can be required to pay support to a woman you dated, even if you're not married, don't kids and don't live together","I don't know if this was posted before, but this is the stuff of nightmares. A Canadian court order a guy to pay +$50k/**month** for **10 years** to a woman he was dating. They were never married, had no kids together, and never shared a home. Link to the news article: https://globalnews.ca/news/7327501/couple-no-home-no-kids-spouses-ontario-court/

Let's review some facts:

1. They dated for 14 years
2. No kids
3. No shared bank accounts
4. Not living together
5. The poor guy proposed **several times**, she finally accepted, but **refused to legally marry him**
6. The poor chump gave her ""thousands of dollars every month, a credit card, paid off her mortgage and showered her with expensive gifts""
7. They travelled together (I'm going to guess on his dime)

When they broke up she asked the court to be recognised legally as his partner and for him to pay support. The first court's decision was for him to pay her +$50k/**month** INDEFINITELY. Can you imagine? The guy appealed and the sentence was reduced from indefinitely to 10 years...

Very Good Pick Up Lines,"If you are wandering down streets and alleyways and see a wahmen with enormous, fat rump, the best thing to do is to scream ""Hey you, fat bitch. Bring your fat ass over here now!"" She will be turned on by alpha energy, is very common for woman to orgasm from pure ecstasy thanks to timbre of voice, I myself have made entire population of Scandinavia orgasm with simple viking shout taught to me by Varg Vikernes.

If you see skinny bitch wander by, best shout is to say ""Good God bitch, do you even eat or lift, brah?"" Then you must devour entire raw chikin, like alpha warrior you are, and chomp the brain of fowl with ferocity. She will be charmed by savage ways you demonstrate similar to the way Mongol King Genghis Khan showed his power many year ago. She will immediately give up Veganism, Feminism and Liberalism, and will become your perfect trad wife.

Special one I develop during covid epidemic, this one is for introverts or those with overly nasal voice. Simply walk up to girl wearing mask and rip it off her face violently, while staring in her eyes and never blinking. No words are spoken. She will be so hot and bothered she will begin to writhe around on floor in agony. Ignore her when she cries for authorities, is simply a shit test, brah.

You must of course follow these techniques to the letter, you must never stray from formula. One helpful tip is rather than go and network and develop social skill, which is just as useful as muscle to attract female, you should instead browse reddit forums and 4chan for hours on end, and you will devlope personality by osmosis like a house plant.

If you are boring fuck and are afraid of social interaction, do not worry brah. As long as you follow formula, even if you are nervous sweaty troglodyte, as long as you do as we the RedPill community say while maintaining Patrick Bateman eye contact, you will fuck like Warlord. Do not check out posting histories of commenters and see that they are computer pencil-neck dork who is addicted to weed and estrogen, they are simply obtaining knowledge.

It is important to never develop your own ideas in RedPill. We need automatons, not leaders. The most important way to shed bluepill NPC programming is to become Redpill robot who next woman when she fart in his presence, as such disrespect is unbearable for great Alexanderian alpha male.

If you are MGTOW I have pickup technique for you. This technique taught to me in midst of congregation by Pastor Roush and his deacon Mystery. You must develop autistic deadpan eyes, and always look above woman head as if schizophrenic spirits are communicating with you. She will know that you are on higher plane, and immediately strip her clothing and submit. This technique was originally developed by Siddhartha, who would often stare at wall for several years while women would pine for his rotund form.

Thoughtful Steps: advice on acting out goals,"When wanting to go somewhere, one needs to think of the place they wish to arrive. 

Once the compass is set, the next move, is making a move.

This seems to be the hardest part, acting out one's vision. 

&gt;**Thoughts create actions.**  
&gt;  
&gt;*One needs to instill the proper thoughts, to provide the proper actions.*

If you believe you will fail, you more than likely will fail.

Now, what one should do instead is instill, replace, and program positive thoughts instead.

You need to re-program yourself

Your sub-conscience will fruition anything it focuses on.

Many do not know this and let the sub-conscience roam, search, and seek quick and easy gratification.

 There are multiple ways to re-program yourself: 

* **Reinforcement/Envision meditation.** This is sitting down and repeating your goal in you head while mediating, and envisioning how you will accomplish this goal.
* **Doing the Write thing.** Writing down what you wish to do, how you wish to do it, why you wish to do it, and that you ***will*** do it.
* **RELAX.**   A *relaxed* state of mind is key to creativity because we become more insightful, leaving us more likely to make connections between ideas, and making plans. It is also easier to instill beliefs into the sub-conscience when the mind is in a relaxed state. (Ex. Hot Bath, mediation music, sun gazing)
* **Positive feedback.** If you get positive results from doing something you will more than likely want to do it more. Reward yourself after accomplishing a goal. 

In order to succeed one needs to set *LONG TERM GOALS* and then provide daily habits and *SHORT TERM GOALS.*

&gt;*LONG TERM GOALS* : **Thoughts create vision**  
&gt;  
&gt;*SHORT TERM GOALS* : **Steps create a path**

Constantly envision, imagine, and believe your goal coming to life.

 **Have the sub-conscience put your** ***""Goal Detestation""*** **on the internal GPS.**

Just like how society programs false narratives into you, one should take control and instill programming into themselves to make it easier to act out their goals. 

Another key step, is having your environment suit your needs.

The less resistance in your path, the easier it will be to take.

Get rid of negative influence in your environment (Ex. Bad friends, bad food,)

Lastly, having a strong desire to achieve the goal provides greater fuel to make it to the destination.

Take a genuine interest in her. Truly understand her.,"The most interesting person to ourselves is ourselves. We know everything there is to know about ourselves, and we love it when someone takes an interest in us.

&amp;#x200B;

**Disclaimer**

This is not a guide for one-night stands, nor is it a guide for all types of girls. The girls I go for are generally the cute/pretty ones who generally enjoy having long conversations. So my experience with this is mainly limited to these kinds of girls. Try this on the ""hot"" girl at a club, and it will likely blow up in your face.

This is not a guide for getting laid or building physical attraction. It's a guide on getting her to an emotional state with you that is far deeper than she has with other guys. Don't bother doing this with a plate that already comes to you on schedule to get fucked. Do this with a girl who you want to have something more than just a physical relation with.

&amp;#x200B;

This is also situational based. It will not work in a loud bar. It will likely not work at a date in a busy caf√©. But it will likely work *very* well at your place or hers - where she feels she can be open without strangers prying in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly. I might have been enough of a social idiot that none of this was common sense to me. I might truly have spent 30 minutes writing something that everyone already knows. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Preface**

When interacting with a girl after learning some of the TRP principles, it becomes easy to get stuck into a trap of constantly monitoring what you are saying or doing. Listening to her while at the same time thinking over what's the best thing you can say in response in order to further your goal of X with her.

This is obviously a step better than men who pay absolutely no attention to how they come across. But not great either.

It's also easy to get into a trap where you feel every interaction with a girl has to somehow end up with your bedroom as the destination, so you do everything you (think) will get you there.

What you need to do with every girl you are interested in, is form a real connection with her. One in which you genuinely get her, and that she feels you genuinely get her.

&amp;#x200B;

**Girls crave being truly understood**

The slightly unattractive girl doesn't get that much attention. Cute ""and up"" girl gets a lot of attention, but nearly all of it sexual in nature. 

They are used that when a guy is interested in them, he'll go on about himself, brag about himself, try to make himself look good. Or he will be far too sexual with her and only focus on her looks and how badly he wants to fuck her.

What most of them don't get though, is someone who takes a deep interest in who they are, and genuinely wants to get to know them better. Someone who is truly interested in them as a person with their own past, desires, dreams, and goals. Most guys are far too stuck inside their own heads to be the type who takes such a deep interest in others. Let alone being the type who knows what to ask in order to get deeper answers.

&amp;#x200B;

**What happens when she feels you are one of the few people who truly understand her?**

She will become comfortable around you. She will be more open around you, more relaxed.

She will also feel good knowing that you - such an interesting and attractive guy yourself - took such an interest in her.

Her emotional attraction to you will drastically go up when she feels this.

What it also does though, it makes **you** come across as more interesting, and her time with you as being overall more interesting as well - because she got to talk so much about the person she's truly interested in - herself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is this emotional level of closeness important?**

Because as I wrote - most guys have absolutely no idea on how to get a girl to such levels of conversation and understanding. You will stand out in her mind by being one of the only ones who knows so much about her, and understands her so well.

When she feels that you are one of those few, she will look forward to spending time with you - because you are one of the few people who she can truly be herself with.

&amp;#x200B;

# Pitfalls and things to keep in mind

**You still need to be interesting**

If you are the kind of person who has nothing to say, then read books, watch documentaries - do whatever you can to amass information that you can use, so that no matter what she wants to talk about - you are able to make a conversation out of it. You need to have at least a base level of conversational skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**She still needs to be interested/attracted to you in the first place**

If she has no interest in you or has no attraction, none of this will work. This is for building *upon* an attraction that is already there, even if small. It will not create an attraction from thin air.

&amp;#x200B;

**You are not her emotional tampon**

You are not there to listen to her complain about her ex-boyfriend. Nor are you there to try and make her feel better. You are there to simply listen and *truly* get to know her. You don't want to know what happened so much as what she thinks/feels about what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

**Do not be one-dimensional**

Do not do this on every date or she will get bored. After spending 3 hours talking to her about feelings and experiences - fuck her properly to show her that you're not one of her girlfriends. If you can't fuck her properly, then simply get physical with her and make-out with her.

Balance deep conversation and *""*softness"" with raw masculine energy.

&amp;#x200B;

**TRP still applies**

Goes without saying that everything about TRP still applies during these conversations. Don't divulge your insecurities and weaknesses to her. Maintain your frame.

Also don't get too stuck into this ""understanding her"" either. Still make a move on her. Still show sexual interest in her. You are at a date, where you'll likely want to move it physically/emotionally to the next step - you are not her therapist.

&amp;#x200B;

# How to do it. How to take a genuine interest and understand her.

How to take a genuine interest... I can't tell. That's the thing about genuine interest.

But if you do have an interest in her, here is how to learn about her and understand her.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ask questions**

The first part is obvious. Ask questions. Don't interview her, don't rapid-fire question after question. Don't make her feel interrogated. Don't make her feel as if you're going off a mental list of things you want to know.

It all needs to feel natural and as a flowing conversation.

With her responses, listen intently for details. It's these details which will guide you towards the next thing to ask. If you start asking her about her job, and then asking her about why she chose that line of work - if she casually mentions that she's always had an interest in that field, the next logical question is - what makes her interested in it?

&amp;#x200B;

**You also need to share**

You obviously need to share and talk about yourself. If you don't, it will really come across as fake and that you are digging for information. Mention how you've always wanted to be in your job as well and you really love it - before asking her what interests her about her job.

So it sounds like I'm teaching you how to have a basic conversation. But the key point is that you do not go on about yourself. You make a comment about yourself, and move on back to her.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do you feel?**

One of the most important things you want to ask, and to know - is how does/did she feel?

Remember that girls work on feelings and that most guys are too thick-skulled to understand that. You want her to talk about her feelings as much as possible. It's through you understanding how she feels about things - that she feels you understand her.

&amp;#x200B;

**Going down into deeper layers**

Now, imagine there are layers of topics. We all don't mind talking about our jobs. But our deeper layer might be how we struggle with depression.

The idea is to get her into those deeper layers. 

Obviously, don't ask her if she's depressed right off the bat, but if she makes a remark about it - mention how you've been depressed too (don't lie, if you haven't) and ask her deeper questions about it.

The idea is that you are always one layer above her. If you are about to take her to the 8th layer, you must have said something about yourself that's on the 7th layer.

The thing to keep in mind here though - is don't divulge too much, especially too soon. She must be deep into a layer before you move what you tell her a layer down.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gauge how comfortable she is, at all times**

The point isn't data-gathering. The point is for her to feel comfortable. If you feel that a topic got a negative reaction from her - or she simply looks uncomfortable, then go up a few layers to something not so deep, to make her comfortable again. Even stop talking about her altogether.

&amp;#x200B;

**The more open you are, the more open she will be**

You need to come across as someone who has nothing to hide, and will talk about anything - there is no topic which you shy away from, and you are an open book.

Obviously, the key aspect here is that you are not an open book. Learn to divulge things about yourself which are deep - but do not take away all the mystery about you either. She can't come out of the conversation feeling like she knows you better than you know her.

And obviously, see from her answers how she might react to the things you say. The last thing you want to do, is to divulge something about yourself which goes into contradiction of her beliefs/desires.

&amp;#x200B;

**Be non-judgemental and learn to detach yourself**

If she is a girl you like and have a romantic interest in, and she mentions an ex, or mentions having casual sex - do not let yourself show that you are upset over it, or that you judge her for her past actions.

You might learn that she has had a few too many partners than you are comfortable with, but even then - no judgment. Simply know that she might not be LTR material after all.

Put aside your moral values and feelings, and simply listen to what she says without judgment. Reserve your judgement for after, when deciding whether to see her again or not.

She truly needs to feel that you will never judge her no matter what she says. If she doesn't feel this, she will hold back, and not go as deep as she might have.

&amp;#x200B;

**Shared commonalities**

Just as important as she feeling that you understand her - is she feeling that you are like her. That you share similar ideas and beliefs. And most importantly, you have shared experiences.

Obviously don't lie, don't fake a point of view on something simply for the sake of being ""like her"".

And it goes without saying that you should not overdo this and come across as trying too hard.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

To try and conclude this, it all comes down to making good conversations, having her feel listened to and understood, and to show that she can truly be herself and 100% open with you - no matter what it is.

The most important thing in all of this is not that ""you come across as genuine"". It is that you **are** genuine. There are no games in this, there is no hidden agenda. There is no goal.",12,1

You Are Not A Circus Clown,"Gimmicks, jokes, and techniques, learning female psychology, even being un-reactive is not necessary to create a connection and get intimate with a girl.

The only thing you actually need to do is not act weird. Don't put on a performance. Act normal. Be socially calibrated.

Girls are automatically attracted to guys, just as we are to them. This understanding will help you immensely.

When you feel like you have low self worth, aren‚Äôt enough, *or have to do something in order to earn her affection and attraction,* that is when the overcompensation, neediness, and weirdness come out.

These are the things that DISENGAGE from attraction. You are DISENGAGING from understanding her sexuality.

It‚Äôs like making a dad joke when you‚Äôre passionately making out.

It kills the vibe. It also sparks red flags. You are not okay with just being yourself. You have to overcompensate.

This sets off an intuitive alarm in people. *Why are they acting like this? Something is off.*

You too, as a man, have this intuitive alarm that goes off when you see a girl playing the victim, gaslighting you, or fishing for attention more than the average girl -- you sense something is off about that potentially BPD girl.

Tons of guys come up with theories on how to attract women. It all comes from a place of low self worth. If you would ask a guy that is naturally good with chicks, he would say ‚Äòjust be yourself‚Äô. 

The counter argument to a natural chad saying ""JBY"" is when a sperge will say *""NOO! YOU NEED TO BE 6 FOOT 4, BENCH 315 LB, HAVE A VTAPER, TEN MILLION IG FOLLOWERS, AND AND AND...""*

Bro, I know you've watched porn. You don't need me to tell you that fat/ugly guys get laid, look at the physical evidence. Head over to the ""amateur"" section and take a look at how many out of shape, skinny, or fat guys are fucking girls you jerk off to.

These guys get laid without knowing all the TRP theory, without being a top percentile SMV male, because they simply accept themselves and are socially calibrated, aka not weirdos.

If you can truly let go of your negative self image, and just have a normal conversation with girls, and then *go for the moves when you want to* - not because the PUA guide you read tells you that this is when you kino and this is when you kiss close, but because your instincts say you should touch the girl now - you‚Äôll realize you‚Äôre putting all this pressure on yourself for no reason.

The origin of having to do a ton in order to win over a girl is that you are not enough as you are.

As Nirvana says, ‚Äúcome as you are‚Äù. Let go of the outcome. Stop trying to be a ring-ling circus performer to win her approval. **Stop caring if she likes you or not. Just assume she does.**

Girls don‚Äôt need to be constantly laughing, giggling, giving you super intense eye contact, and putting their hands all over you in order to be attracted to you. Sure, you'll get the girls that throw all these signals of attraction at you, but the average girl is much more subtle, and you trying to balance a stack of tennis balls on your head while you talk to her will only make you seem inauthentic and weird.

Take the pressure off of yourself, assume she already likes you, and just build  rapport with her.  Converse. Be light hearted a little bit. That‚Äôs all you need.

All the extra bells and whistles, all the crazy actions you can do, all the push-pull, excessive physicality, pushing her buttons, dissing/neg her, overly disagreeing with her because you want to show her you're disagreeable rather than genuinely disagreeing, etc. are all extra, and in fact, many times they alienate her (even if they make her giggle on the spot).


Seeking approval of others is not your life purpose, gents.

It's women's.

YOUR life purpose is CONQUEST, ACHIEVEMENT and MOVING FORWARD. This could be in sports, arts and creativity, business, adventure, education, etc.

Masculine energy is uncomfortable when it's not pushing forward, because that's its natural purpose. Its primary quality is strength/potency. The same masculine energy that drives the kickboxer to fight like an animal drives the artist to paint a beautiful scene, the musician to decorate time with sound, and the teacher to educate and forge his protege.

Feminine energy is uncomfortable when it's isolated, because union is its natural purpose. Its primary quality is receptivity. It receives and makes life out of the world around it. While masculine energy PUSHES, feminine energy PULLS. While masculine energy demands to MOVE and to BE a powerful force, feminine energy demands to BE MOVED, to FEEL CONNECTED TO this world's most powerful forces.

You're basically a woman with a penis if you're depressed over women not liking, and you feel one would complete you. THAT'S NOT HOW THINGS WORK.

Everything you need to be complete as a man, and to attract women you enjoy being with, is already within you. Society and the environment may have suppressed those qualities of yours, but they're there.

If you're a man who's unsuccessful with women, your issue is frequently misdiagnosed as just not having met the right woman/women yet. Wrong. The issue is that you're not PUSHING FORWARD strongly enough. Does it make you feel uncomfortable? Did society tell you that your natural masculine instinct is toxic?

Problem is, too many modern men and women are dissociated from their natural sexual energies. Men feel like their natural aggression and pushing is only ever destructive, and women feel like their natural servitude and pulling is only ever oppressive. So men choose to be soft and women choose to be hard.

Sounds like you? Or anyone you know?

I encourage you to find a mountain to climb, metaphorically speaking. Think of something you really want to accomplish, then do the damn work day by day.

NO, ""GETTING A GIRLFRIEND"" DOESN'T COUNT.

Become a purposeful man, and watch how your anxieties and neuroses about women slowly, maybe suddenly fade away.

**When your life revolves around female approval, the possibility of getting a girlfriend, what your female friends/acquaintances are doing, you assume a feminine role in the world.**

You're depolarized and girls will only ever see you as just another girlfriend, but with a penis.

But when your life revolves around BUILDING YOURSELF UP and reaching new heights as a man in whatever domains you feel at home in, your masculine energy naturally rises. You care more for your masculine purpose than for women's approval.

Seeing a man at work turns women on like seeing a woman dancing in lingerie turns men on.

So stop asking yourself ""what'll I do to get girls to like me?""

Start asking yourself ""what'll I do to be proud of myself?""

Stop seeking approval from women. Find conquest for yourself, and women WILL NOTICE YOU. They'll naturally want YOUR approval when they see you're a powerful masculine force.

Performing, begging or bargaining with women to choose you as a sexual option will remove you from their sexual radars. 

Being receptive and soft only works to attract women who are sexually depolarized, who are less feminine and more masculine than the average woman.

Failure in the dating world ISN'T being single. You can be dating and sleeping with absolutely 0 women and still be a catch.

Failure is being stuck with a woman who doesn't respect you.

Failure is being a little bitch who loses his shit over what women do.

Failure is becoming a travelling juggler for the sake of impressing women.

Success isn't having a woman. Success is being a valuable man.

So gents,

Push forward in life. Be strong and unbreakable. Your masculinity comes from within you, what you accomplish, and imposing your will on the world. Not from having a wife or a girlfriend, not from the people who approve of you (or not). You'll be more proud of being yourself when you're challenging and growing yourself day by day, and women will be more proud to be with you.",13,1
"[FIELD REPORT] Girl tells me she‚Äôs gay, then proceeds to make love to me","TLDR: Girl tells me she‚Äôs ‚Äúsuper gay‚Äù starts flirting with me, and escalating to the point where we do the dirty.

God I love shit tests. Once you get good at noticing them it becomes a mini-game for life. To make a long story shorter, I moved to another part of my state during this quarantine and was having a little dry-spell since most people are (rightly so) not willing to meet up because of the pandemic.

Off to tinder I went, matching with 8‚Äôs and 9‚Äôs, messaging most of them and meeting up with a small percentage. I matched with a very alternative looking girl named G who seemed very cool. We have a similar taste in music, enjoy watching the same types of movies, and both like fitness. 

Not looking for a relationship though, I reached out seeing if she was open to meeting up. She was. Our first hangout was fun. I picked her up and her place and we went for a walk around town, checking out cool trails and popular parts of the downtown area where I live. 

About halfway through our hangout she tells me flat out ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm super gay and really into girls‚Äù. At the time I didn‚Äôt even question it. Not looking or expecting much besides a friend right now so I played it off. To my surprise, after we finished hanging out she started flirting with me hardcore over text.

A week goes by and we meet again, she‚Äôs a bit more comfortable around me and I around her. Flirting and kino begin to escalate and we kiss. Good stuff. Another few days go by and we meet for a third time. Between those few times she was texting me about how she felt butterflies while hanging out with me even though she is ‚Äúsuper gay‚Äù (her words). 

During the third meetup my game is on point. Teasing, having fun, escalating, and kino moving towards a climax. I remember at one point she stops and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little nervous, would you be ok if we stopped here?‚Äù I answered, of course, it seemed to assuage her concerns and she went back to kissing me and then she started escalating lol.

We took it back to my room, and escalated further up until she said ‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù and then f*cked me. 

So I suppose I passed her shit tests?",181,1

"Dating in the North is, on average, much easier than dating in the South/Sun Belt","If you‚Äôre fat or ugly in South Florida or Southern California, good luck.

After all the traveling I have done this summer, I notice how the people in the north are, on average, less focused on beauty.

The majority of things you see regarding nightlife, partying, sex appeal, clubbing, etc... is in the Sun Belt. Stretching from Southern California all the way to South Carolina on the east coast.

Excuse me for saying this but people up north are much more uptight and miserable. The people in the South just have that cheerful optimism and chill attitude whereas people up north tend to have that overly protective and pessimistic attitude. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs easier to date over there. You don‚Äôt have to have much sex appeal to attract somebody. Being ‚Äúsexy‚Äù isn‚Äôt as popular a thing in the North as it is in the Sun Belt

I will also argue that men and women in the Sun Belt (and Hawaii) are just on average more attractive. If you‚Äôre fat in a sunny place, you don‚Äôt get to cover yourself up because it gets hot. Everybody just sees how fat you are. It‚Äôs not me being an asshole, it‚Äôs science.

You wouldn‚Äôt have a Las Vegas or the entertainment industry in Maine or North Dakota. You also have much more beauty pageants in the sun belt. It‚Äôs just a tradition. We also border with Mexico and the Caribbean, thus we have more Latin American influence. More of that flex culture than the North.

Plastic surgery is also more common in the South than in the North. This is because since the sun plays a larger role in our lives, we just show more skin. It‚Äôs the same reason why people here on average have more tattoos.

Dating up North is easier because people are more open minded towards looks and appearances. They don‚Äôt really care as much about beauty as the South.",16,1

White women eat themselves,"This is a multi-generational argument about the cycle of white women in the west. 

White women see themselves as a key part to the progressive movement. A key feature of progressivism is the disavowal of opinions previously held by progressives that are no longer progressive enough. White women, however, have systematized this into a self-cannibalizing stew. I am talking of course about the Karen. 

The vicious hatred held for gen X ""karens"" will eventually fall on the millenial women and then the Gen Z women.  Maybe it is due to some subconscious hatred for post-wall women, but what cannot be disputed is that the successive generations, of their own volition, separate out and then target older versions of themselves.

Margaret Atwood created the character of Serena Joy, a post wall women viciously bitter and sorely unhappy. Serena Joy is merely an upper class Karen, 50 years before Karen became a term.

**What Does This Mean**

Women hate themselves, if at the very least on a deeply subconscious level. How you use this information is up to you, based on your frame and personality. However, it is important to note that women fear age more than we, as men, can truly comprehend.",1,1

Stop Using Reddit,"It's really easy to slip into habits, trust me I know. I still haven't kicked the old cancer sticks, partly because I don't really want to despite the long running termination of life for most of my family from tobaccy induced lung cancer. It's easy to get addicted to shit, smokes, booze, poker, all sorts of vices. Shit, even porno is addictive now thanks to the high octane super speeds your Wankmeister 3000 can deliver it to you. You likely know about these vices, and are either working to give them up, or just don't give a shit and are fine with wrecking your life.

Back when I was le epic gamer as the kids say, I must have logged over a kabillion hours into RuneScape. Shit was addicting. And grindy. All of those hours I could've spent working out or learning a new skill like Mandarin or violin or how to flick my tongue like a viper. Even a resource like TheRedPill is freaky addictive. You begin to use places like this (or sosuave when I was a kid, the more PUAdouchbag version of this place) as a crutch. My impersonal mentor, Monsieur Pook explained that when you are constantly sitting on your phone or in front of your computer, you aren't learning really much of anything. That's why you have such a problem actualizing the stuff you read. You aren't really learning anything, you're regurgitating information or steps that some random booptard on the internet told you. That's nothing. You're letting the guides dictate how you live your life, rather than combing the information with what you believe to create your own philosophy and mindset. 

My dms are always getting messages from guys asking me 'is this redpill' 'is this alpha' but the truth is you already know this. Your ancestors were alpha or else you wouldn't have been born. Non-powerful people didn't get laid in ancient times. The betas got eaten by mountain lions or skewered by cannibals. The same is mostly true today. Betas don't get beautiful women. When I say GET I mean GET, as in fully obtain in mind and body, the rich and beta will always find a woman to scam them. Alphaness is your NATURAL state. Don't be misled by the blue pilled world, you were meant for better things.


This natural alphaness occurs from acting on INSTINCT. Your high T (which increases by working out) instinct makes you a super human. So many men are afraid of their own mind and energy, it terrifies them and causes them to freeze up in high pressure situations like chatting up a bombshelle. But don't be afraid of failure. Failure is just an opportunity to learn.

32y/o Nice guy starting the red pill journey....not gonna lie im nervous and alone on this trip,"Hey guys, 

I think I've hit rock bottom and snapped and ready to restart my life, quarantine seems like the perfect time to start rant/decompression/etc below

TLDR no parents, no male role-models/mentors, surrounded by toxic women...i need out

I was raised by two narcissists who gave 0 fucks about me growing up, they did their damndest to keep me alone and isolated so not only have I never had a father figure in my life, but I was raised to be a typical ""nice guy"".  I struggle to have real relationships, never mind any ""luck"" with women(obviously not luck, but to say im terrible at getting laid is an understatement), my socialization skills are crap tbh and women take advantage of me all the time.  I have zero confidence or drive in life anymore...I tried the pickup thing but that all was surface level stuff that never really built up my confidence and the community on reddit is pretty shit imo.  Im not completely useless, I managed to get into the cyber security field and get into investing, so moneys been in abundance, i need help with everything else

My first step is to go through No More Mr.Nice Guy again and actually take action on it, followed by the Way of the Superior Man as well as whatevers in the sidebar assuming any of that is kept up to date.  

Anyway, I think thats all for now, thanks for sitting through my rant....if anyone wants to join me or act as a sudo-mentor thatd be cool....we have a discord or something, i cant remember the last time I used IRC, damn lol",50,1

Women are drug addicts,"**Summary:**   
All women are addicted to Feelz. You too can learn to synthesize your own drugs and become a drug dealer. Women will keep coming back to get their fix and you get to reap the rewards of their addiction. 

**Body:**

Drug dealers with good product don't have a hard time creating repeat customers. Once their client is hooked, they will keep coming back over and over again even at their own detriment. The Redpill is in fact amoral so why not embrace it and become a drug dealer with me, it's fun. Before you can start that slinging dick, you need to increase your SMV to a point that your drugs are the equivalent of pure uncut Colombian coke. An often overlooked part of SMV is your ability to fuck. My current plate was concerned that she would get ""White guy sex"" when she first met me, and boy was she surprised when she got the fucking of a life time.  This is something we don't have metrics for like lifting, finance etc. The only way to test out the quality of your drugs to fuck a woman and see what happens after. Having a high SMV will get them into bed and fucking them like a demigod on boner pills from outer-space will get them to come back for another fix. 

**Fuck like a demigod and give them an experience to remember**

If you haven't read the sex god method, I suggest you read that for a robust explanation. Think of it like going to get a massage. If done properly, you leave your current existence into one of pure bliss and relaxation. The sounds in the room, the smells and everything else combined create an ""experience"" that is fully immersive (The I in DEVI). You want to create an experience for your woman by making her feel intense emotions. There are a lot of ways to do this and I plan to write another post in the future detailing some of the methods I employ.  Make her cum first once, maybe even twice before you even think about cumming. You aren't jerking off to porn right?  Make them beg for your cum, but don't give it right away. Girls who want to make you cum will fuck like complete psychopaths, it's incredible what they will do. 

**You gotta pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers in this racket.**

Having an orgasm and then having sex again right after seems to be critical in creating drug addicts. If you can only fuck for one session, you will need to up your cardio, testosterone or whatever is causing you to be a pussy. I have asked a few women why sex wasn't good in the past, and this was an important metric I never paid attention to. As a healthy male you should be able to have more than one orgasm in a session. I recently invented something I call The Trifecta‚Ñ¢. Not only do you have to cum 3 times in one session, but you have to cum in her pussy, ass and then mouth in that order. 

**Slinging that dick like crack**

Once you have the good shit and you are ready to start slinging, go look for a potential junky. My favorite type of junkie is the crazy girl. You can get any woman addicted, but the ones with super addictive personalities tend to be higher on the crazy scale due to daddy issues or childhood trauma. Women with lower self esteem will typically remain addicted even when their ego has been smashed and they know they are just an option among many. This increases their attraction and gets them more addicted because they have no self worth. Doing the drugs you give them creates a moment of release where the finally feel ""normal"". Drugs like nicotine don't actually elevate you, they just bring you back up to a baseline of a normal non smoker in terms of how you feel. Once the nicotine leaves your body, the desire to smoke returns and you begin to get irritable and have cravings. 

**Women get withdrawal just like junkies**

Women have a similar come down reaction when you have sex with them. All of their anxiety, fear, sadness or whatever negative feelings they have go away for a brief moment. The ecstasy of sex and the bonding drugs that get released into the body endogenously create a wonderful warm cocoon similar to heroin. The feelings of ""love"" overwhelm them and they feel not only desired, but worthy. 

If you really want an addicted woman, you can't just dick her down and leave her in a puddle of cum. TRP doesn't talk a ton about comfort, but it is required if you want repeat customers. Drug addicts need cuddles or they go nuts. This is even more true the more you degrade them, such as pulling off the Trifecta on the first date. Women are a bottomless pit and will require more and more drugz to feel normal in life. They will have bad moods, lack of sleep and a constant hamster wheel spinning around telling them to get more of the drug. A common thing I have noticed with the women I fuck is that they all report they can't sleep anymore after they meet me.  This is another sign that you have created a junkie.  My plate said ""I hate how much I love your dick. I feel completely powerless and I don't like it."" If you hear this, you know you are on the right track.

**Conclusion:**  
Women are drug addicts and we get to be drug dealers. You can become so addicting to a woman that she will do almost anything to get more of the drugs you offer. Once a woman is addicted, you have control over her.",88,1

Blue Pill Example: Guy makes elaborate plan to catch his cheating girlfriend.,"shorturl.at/noxNW

We all end up coming to that realization someday that our girl might not be as faithful as we thought. After imbibing some of TRP principles over the years, for me personally this situation comes to no real surprise. It is not an ultimate destination for LTRs but a likely one that we need to be prepared for. The man in this highly rated video makes an elaborate plan to make his cheating drive over for valentines day from one hour away (per the video), where the only goal is to humiliate her for the audience. My question is, whose insecurity is glaring here? Sure, the comments are full of beta cucks praising this individual and absolutely shitting on the girl.

If I learned anything after trying to imbibe TRP into my own life and behavior, I would just drop the woman right there and continue with my mission. A truly realized man would have enough things to do, working on his career, working on his body and on new plates to care enough to go through the lengths this guy has gone too. Rose petals on the floor, a teddy bear, a print out of the texts where this woman cheated on him. The relationship was already over before she stepped into his home, so the only reason for all this was for this simp to get a one up on her after his heart was obviously broken. It's sad that such behavior is promoted as per the reactions of people in the comments, but for me personally, I can't be happier I came across this sub a few years ago. I no longer feel dependent enough on a woman to make myself go through such an ordeal to get ""revenge"".",14,1

Guide to getting laid in highschool and college: Chad edition,"High school and college Chad, we all know him. He is the star running back, every girl within an 2 hours of you follows him on Instagram, his Snapchat is flooded with thirsty thots that want to be pounded by him, he fucks a new girl every week and brags to your lunch table, you become invisible as soon as he walks in the room. Obviously if you are on this reddit page you aren‚Äôt this guy, he is naturally red pilled and will probably never download reddit. Today I will tell you guys how to become High school and college chad.  I am now in my second year of college, I went from a 10th grade virgin to fucking hot girls in 11th grade, to now having ass 2-3 times a week in college. I believe it comes down to 2 aspects, appearance, and social status.
1. APPEARANCE
Your clothes simply have to fit well. Your athletic shorts have to be above the knee, and your shirts have to be form fitting and slim so they show off your upper body that you have made killing it at the gym. Wear shoes that infer athleticism like adidas boosts or Nike haraches. I guarantee you that‚Äôs what chad is wearing. At my high school simply good hygiene will instantly put you in the top 60% because a lot of guys don‚Äôt shave, stink and still get there hair cut by some idiot at great clips. Shave if you can‚Äôt grow a beard because these half beards make you look autistic. Shower daily and use antiperspirant so you don‚Äôt start to stink half way through the day. Go get a nice fade from a good barber in your area, or if you can rock some flow do it because girls love it. Go go to the gym. You don‚Äôt need to look like The Rock but you do have to have a low body fat percentage and muscle because let‚Äôs face it, Twigs don‚Äôt get laid.

2.SOCIAL MEDIA AND SOCIAL STATUS
You should be able to talk to a girl for at least 30 minutes about your hobbies and interests. Play a sport, go to partys, go to top golf with people you know ,join the team the prom commuter. You have to live an exciting life because girls don‚Äôt do anything besides sit on Instagram and collect dopamine, and do sports for the sole purpose of having a fat ass. Girls need an interesting guy to fill the void in there boring life. What I am going to tell you next is without a doubt the easiest way to get laid. You need a popping Instagram. Post pictures of you with girls or your bro‚Äôs at parties, you playing sports, and activities you do. One of my best friends in highschool was the chad. He was always posting pics of him playing football, and doing other exciting things. He had girls that he had never met lining up with there ass‚Äôs up and face down simply because of his Instagram that indicated high social status. The older guys on THEREDPILL sometimes say social media is a waste of time, but us younger guys know this isn‚Äôt true. Highschool and colleges guys live in small worlds where they don‚Äôt meet many people. Instagram and Snapchat are your connection to the the thots from the school a half an hour away that are going through there rebellious phase. They will bounce on as many cocks as they can to piss there parents off, and you have no other way of meeting them besides Instagram. 

Now you have all you need to know to get laid as a young guy. Get off Reddit and go out and start doing everything I have said. Lastly, understand that as a man you are good enough for every woman.",54,1
33 Years of Marriage Wasted,"Not my marriage of course - I don't want to get married especially after hearing about this situation. It's between the parents of a girl I've been dating for almost a year.

They have been married for over three decades. Conservative, traditional, Catholic family. They have four kids together. The father is a hardworking, respectable man; he literally built their house.

Recently the mother admitted that she has been cheating with another guy for a few years. The father handled everything very well; remained stoic, decided not to hold a grudge, and let her take as much time as she needed to get her shit together.

She eventually moved out of the family's house and in with her boyfriend. Now they're going through divorce proceedings, and it's as bad as TRPers claim. She wants money for half of the family's property (worth about $400k, so she would get ~ $200k). Plus she wants a portion of the father's retirement, which would cost a massive fee because he is not retirement age yet. Apparently she suggested that if the father cannot afford to pay up, he could ""work it off.""

Fucked up on so many levels. If there was any doubt in my mind before, I am now fully convinced that marriage is a sham.",402,1
As a woman who has seen it all...,"Hi there.   I find all of this fascinating and so different from the way we dated in the 70's. (Guys asking you to couple skate....   coming to your door for a date).

Honestly, it looks like the human race will die out reading all these posts.  I see a lot of truth...on both sides to some statements.

I also hear and see anxiety.   It's sad.

Here is what I have noticed that have changed and my thoughts:

1).  Men were more masculine.  Smoked.  Worked on cars. Lifted weights in yard.
2).  Men were more mature, usually by 25 they were...Men.  Today a 35 year old man to me seems kind of lost and immature... to me.  At about 40...some still have great conversational skills.  I think the next generation might just give up talking.
3).  Men treated women the way they treated their sisters.
4).  A lot of sex in high school.  Senior year.
5)   in college in the 80s there were more women than men.  If we liked someone we chased them.  We had one night stands.  Then later,  we had boyfriends.
6).  Most of the guys were great. Funny. Smart.  We weren't treated like garbage, we were treated like equals.

I really love men and although I am married now,  I don't regret a single man I dated from the mechanic to the guy from Brazil and I can't recall his name.

Sex was as it should be:  playful, erotic, vulnerable, gentle, hard, emotional and fun. We didn't have to think about plays, games, red pill. 

I did like the bad boys some, but they really weren't ltr material.  So it was a rare treat. Like candy.

I just want you to know, the best sex I ever had was in a ltr,  just mind blowing.   

We liked when men could finally show us vulnerability...  it helped our fears.  

I'm 54 and I'm telling you the very best sex is with an adventurous and vulnerable partner. 

I'm just sad reading all this.

I wish everyone the best.

"Entering a new organization, community, or being part of a new group. Here are my basic 5 golden tips for you. (Respect, likability, and receiving extras)","1. **Purchase a notebook**, remember and write down everyone‚Äôs name you have a conversation with (especially important when there are many people). Enjoy the process, it‚Äôs a pleasant game. There‚Äôs probably no way you will remember all the names in one go, and that‚Äôs absolutely okay. The process of writing it down will help you remember them until you do. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name by the way‚Äù is sufficient, followed by the answer and your response ‚Äúah cool, my name is ....‚Äù. As the many books you‚Äôve probably read say, a person‚Äôs name is special. It‚Äôs their name, everyone wants to feel special, they carry that name with them their whole lives, it only makes sense that people like it when you remember it, especially if you are new. You might encounter someone seeing you writing it down or reviewing it, just tell them you like remembering people‚Äôs names, and people respect that. Don‚Äôt be creepy about it, just keep a page with names, that‚Äôs all. The faces will match the names and vice versa along time. Do your best not to ask anyone twice, and address people by their first name. (For example: you cross by someone who you‚Äôve learned the name of yesterday, ‚ÄúHey Elise‚Äù while staying on your track does more than you think). Intentionally ask people for their names : ‚Äúhey,  what‚Äôs your name by the way... ah cool‚Äù. One thing you must remember, personal branding does not belong to you, your branding belongs to the audience and what they make of it. Be very specific about appointments, timings, opening hours, closing hours, write it all down and be on-time/consistent.

2. **Don‚Äôt gossip**, period. You can laugh with everyone while they do it, but never, ever initiate. If you want to talk about people behind their back, do so when they deserve the praise and be genuine about it. Like the decent human being you are or atleast should be. The only situation I can think of is a clear enemy, which shouldn‚Äôt be part of the group/community/organization to start off with. You may take them down in class and confidence.

3. Be a silent extrovert. You don‚Äôt need to talk to anyone but enjoy every conversation. As a silent extrovert, you have oversight on everything, and it‚Äôs easy to pick up cues, body language, and additional people/ surrounding information.

4. **Take lead**, publicly, silently, in sight, with actions and sometimes words. People automatically follow, it‚Äôs like a wheel you turn. That‚Äôs influence. Take responsibility by yourself on specific actions and be consistent. Allow space for people to join you, it‚Äôs okay if you leave things 90% done in many cases because it allows people to join in and help you, you‚Äôd be pleasantly surprised to see the work done before you even start in future cases.

5. Never forget, **you are a king**, unshakable. I‚Äôll tell you straight up, and I‚Äôd tell anyone if they‚Äôd ask the right questions, I feel like a king. I act as a king, if not an emperor. Without looking down on anyone. Your behavior invites similar behavior, and people like to associate with that.

Extra: 

A. Have utmost respect for service workers (security, culinary, receptionists, etc.) this always comes in handy. Also, it‚Äôs just decent and shows class.

B. When in an agitating situation. SLOW DOWN. There is almost no lower bound to how slow you can go, if the world is in chaos, the slower you go, the better it can be. It keeps you and and your influence in control. NEVER be more nervous than a woman.

C. When people talk about their achievements, or something they‚Äôve accomplished, praise them. Simple praises make great relationships.

Don‚Äôt overdo anything.

IF someone disrespects, ignore, stay stable, and if necessary, explain/feedback shown behavior towards you, back to them, in simple spoken language. You can indicate clear boundaries.

Be calm, confident, pleasant, and assertive.

Be a people‚Äôs person.

Enjoy.",55,1

Questions about Frame,"I've been reading a lot of articles and watched some YT videos on frame. Often, folks explain what it is and how it works, but there seems very little info on how to actually strengthen our frame other than ""visualizing that we have a strong frame"". I'm looking at something that's more actionable.

Also, I've some questions regarding frame :

1) Is \*actual\* success the only real way to build frame? Let's say, I have a business and I start generating lots of profits, become a lot richer than the average guy. Will this contribute to my frame becoming a lot stronger? Or say, if I start talking to more girls and gradually get better at flirting, that's also a way to build frame?

2) When you face a guy with a very strong frame (e.g: Tony Robbins, Dwyane Johnson), does that mean that we'll auto-lose to them in terms of frame cos' there's no way to fake our frame to be stronger than theirs?

3) Is it possible for an employee / student to ""out-frame"" the boss / teacher?

4) Does Rollo Tomassi's book give any actionable strategies on how to build frame? The content feels very dry to me....",29,1
My experience with the Red Pill and Blue Pill,"Background :- I am a 24 guy from a very small town in southern India with my lover 25 , together since 2013. Town is small enough for us to not know what feminism even means, and I got exposed to this only when I started working. Both are software engineers doing quite well in terms of finance.

**My discovery of Red Pill** :- My ex gf cheated on me with my fake account, it was like I had 2 fb accounts and two number , one was me (let's call him simp) and another became this perfect jerk ( let's call him Chad üòÜ ) even though she told the simp me to not involve with chad as he is a bad guy but , she eventually had sex chats with Chad . I enjoyed it though , (kind a afraid I have a cuckold in me) .

Then I met my girl , who I respected a lot and refuced to believe all woman are same but still applied and did things Chad  did with my ex , and it worked .

It is clear that she can't say no to any of my sexual acts, here sex is still a taboo,and the kinks just a sin, so basically I make her commit sins to fulfill my needs and there is no concept of consent . I only say sorry when I feel like , never listen to her desires I decide what she needs , make her wait during our dates and call her out on almost anything. There are consistant throwing a beverage on her face or silent treatment whenever she becomes bitchier which üíØ of the time results is her coming naked for me and apologizing. She also tells me I am a flirt and a jerk and admits to have been completely taken by me .

Well I thought we were wierd and unnatural only until I saw some MGTOW to descover these were the true nature of a girl and I was doing everything right , and was getting this royal treatment where she just serves me everyday.

Advantage of being in a non feminism place is that I can talk this with her , and she actually admits to like when I treat her like my property and manipulate her . She gets horny when I control her or am agressive.

A part of this submission I think comes from her weak father , who at 56 earns less than her, she basically takes care of her home. And basically takes important decisions herslef for which she consults me for.

**THIS PART I CALL THE ANIMAL PART OF OUR RELATIONSHIP**

**The Blue Pill part** :- Well you can say the relationship is the blue pill part, here in India no one believes the concept of love , the marriage is usually arranged and it is not a necessary thing to be in love, there are many other things that are essential (quite red pill ). 

We are actually in love , we say each other the we love . I usually cook for her , pick her to drop her to her office, am the dumping person for all her personal problems which is a lot considering her fathers unmanliness. 

I tell her all my insecurities, including my horrible bullied incidents and how I am still afraid to fight back . I cry in front of her atleast once every 2 months , I have a crying problem being a man, only she has ever respected and treated in a appropriate way and which really makes me feel that she is the most amazing person ever. I had another insecurity if my man boobs ,( now almost gone) but she never ever disrespected me ever .

This part of both of us doesn't come naturally but comes with the effort we put on each other. It is the part where we remove the attraction and work toward a better life 

**THIS PART I CALL THE HUMAN PART**

I think this is how we should manage it , be agressive RED PILL and submissive for maintaining attraction and use your brain and decide unnaturally things to do for marriage and relationship BLUE PILL

The Coming Matriarchy &amp; The Case for Father Custody,"This isn't a men's right post, and I'm not advocating for any political action (despite the clickbait title). This essay does have an important sexual strategy message too (don't get girls pregnant), but I mainly want to point out the consequences of the sexual revolution and the consequences of feminism. I understand the enjoy the decline mentality, however I just want to point out that the below is what results, which in my opinion is quite devastating.

We know that around 40% of marriages end in divorce:  [https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/marriages-ending-divorce-uk?year=latest&amp;time=1965..2017](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/marriages-ending-divorce-uk?year=latest&amp;time=1965..2017), and that in the vast majority of cases the woman is awarded custody of the children: [https://singleparentsonholiday.co.uk/single-parent-statistics-new-facts-and-figures/](https://singleparentsonholiday.co.uk/single-parent-statistics-new-facts-and-figures/). Despite what you read in the media about single mothers being wonderful, the below quote shows the utter train-wreck that results from women being awarded custody:

&gt; ‚ÄòFemale headed households are a minority of households, but they generate over 70% of the criminal class. According to a study made by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 72% of incarcerated juvenile delinquents grew up in broken homes, mostly female headed‚Ä¶. According to Getting Men Involved: the Newsletter of the Bay Area Male Involvement Network, ‚Äò 63% of youth suicides come from fatherless homes, 90% of all homeless and runaway children are from fatherless homes, 85% of all children exhibiting behavioural disorders come from fatherless homes‚Ä¶ 71% of all high school dropouts come from fatherless homes, 75% of all adolescent patients in chemical abuse centres come from fatherless homes, 70% of juveniles in state-operated institutions come from fatherless homes, and 85% of all youths in prison grew up in fatherless homes.‚Äô  **The Case for Father Custody - Daniel Amneus, Ph.D. (1999, Primrose Press) p.11**

In addition, children in female-headed households are also far more likely to live in poverty than children in male-headed households (about twice as likely). In fact, if you live in a female-headed household, you have a **40% chance of living in poverty:**  [https://www.epi.org/publication/female-headed-families-children-poverty/](https://www.epi.org/publication/female-headed-families-children-poverty/) . 40%!!! That figure is quite astonishing.

We all know why women like it this way (Alpha Fucks-Beta Bucks, or just Alpha fucks and then get the government to pay for it), but the fact that men tolerate this situation is quite astonishing. It's almost as if men would rather seek the approval of women through white-knighting than actually ensure that children are properly cared for. 

I would also suggest that much of the **Antifa** riots is caused by this removal of the male from the family. Quite tragic really, but I don't see things getting any better, so enjoy the decline. And keep it wrapped.",72,1

"You‚Äôre not a victim and the world doesn‚Äôt owe you anything, so why act like it?","I believe these two points are intertwined. These two ideas are very subtle and can creep into even the strongest of minds quite easily. The two ideas are that of the ‚Äúvictim mentality‚Äù and the ‚Äúyou owe me‚Äù mentality. These two behaviors are beta at their core. They‚Äôre behaviors that illustrate dependency. They both cause you to express a ‚Äúneed‚Äù or validation and acceptance of others around you. And these two things are sure to lead you right back to being a beta, even after much progress.


Everyone, including you, looks at themselves as the most important person in the world. It‚Äôs so powerful, that you can sometimes deceive yourself into thinking someone close to you, such as your family or friends, owes you something. 


Additionally, everyone knows themselves better than they know anyone else. You‚Äôre the coolest person you know. You also can have the tendency to rationalize your fears, angers, and wants. 



Point 1: Never expect others to do for you, what you have for them. Always do with the hope that the favor will be returned, but never expect it to be returned. The key word here is ‚Äúexpect‚Äù. It‚Äôs important to understand that your expectations have to be changed. Understand that people are in this world, working to benefit themselves, not you. 

There is a key idea in persuasion and sales literature where you do something for someone in order to influence them to do for you. People may feel like they owe you as a result of you doing something. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean people will do things in return for you, influence or not. It works sometimes, and not others. The bottom line is, whenever you agree to do something for others, do it without expecting anything in return. If the favor is too much given this, then decline doing it. 


Point 2: Strength your mental fortitude by denying yourself the ability to become a victim. Look at the weak in this world. Almost every single one of them has an agenda to create an equal and safe place for all. They use rhetoric and convincing arguments to state their points. At the end of the day, it is a display of their insecurities and inability to rise to internal and external challenges.

What can you do to combat this? You can start by listening to your thoughts. Mindfulness is an effective tool to hear what you‚Äôre telling yourself. When there is something that needs to be done, listen to what your mind says. It may tell you that you can skip the gym because you need a day off. It will tell you that this whole cold approach thing is too hard. It will tell you that you have had a rough life and that you need to take it easy. It will tell you whatever you want to hear, in order to get you to the path of least pain and resistance. But, it is these times that you must call yourself out. There is no need to judge or beat yourself up over it once you do realize you‚Äôre playing the victim. Instead, pick yourself up, and do the thing that you are supposed to. The thing your higher self truly wants. And, when you hear yourself making excuses in your mind, or to others, call yourself out. Tell yourself that you are making an excuse, and that you need to take full responsibility for yourself and everything that you do. That you are the leader of your own world, and nothing can stop you from getting after whatever it is that you want. Don‚Äôt allow yourself to play the victim.",104,1

Emotional abuse isn‚Äôt harmful... Right?,"My wife (32F) and I (34M) have been struggling for some time.  We have 3 young children.  Mid-2018 she became severely depressed because of 1) being laid off from a job and 2) finding a new job that would up being a nightmare.  I told her time and time again to quit (she doesn‚Äôt need to work) and she refused because her pride would have been hurt.  

During this time she became very emotionally abusive...  She‚Äôd point out everything I was doing even remotely wrong as a parent, a husband, with my hobbies, etc.  She put her parents first.  She didn‚Äôt want to do anything new/fun.  She ignored my requests for help.   End of the day, I had a huge anxiety attack earlier this year and left the house because I couldn‚Äôt handle it.  She quit her job, found a new (good) one, she started antidepressants, etc. - she‚Äôs doing really good. 

We‚Äôre trying to make things work still but it‚Äôs hard.  I have issues trusting her intentions, even when she says little compliments like I ‚Äúlook good‚Äù.  I have really bad issues where I question my parenting decisions, I‚Äôm picking on myself when I do stuff (e.g. I like to do woodworking and am picking out every flaw now) - it‚Äôs rough.

Anyways, every time I talk to someone about it they basically tell me I need to get over it because she was depressed.  I ask them what would have happened if I killed myself, because I started becoming a little suicidal - the answer is basically ‚Äúwell, you didn‚Äôt‚Äù.  I bet if I was depressed and treating her the same way everyone would be telling her to leave me.  

It‚Äôs hard feeling like I shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to have my emotions taken seriously.  I‚Äôm struggling and everyone thinks I should just get over myself.",6,1

I'm in good shape and look cute after 2y of gym so I get enough matches to meet one or two decent girls every week. All standard stuff, sometime they are looking for fun and sometimes for a LTR. Sometimes I get one home, sometimes I don't.

But the girl I met today blow me off.

It was Thursday midnight when we matched on Tinder. I had a place booked for next day, but no date.

Immediately after matching SHE asks me if I want to go out for a drink. I have experience of several tens of matches, and that never happened to me not straight away at least. Anyway, I do have a place and immediately I text back. Again to my surprise she accepts on the spot.

Ok, at that point I feel lucky to have found such a direct girl. What a rare thing, am I right?

So cut straight to the date, we meet, hug, get a table, and do some small talk.

She is north European, tall, blonde, and quite handsome but I avoid any comment on her beauty. She, on the opposite, almost immediately says it to me. And I feel good.

What immediately makes me wary is the eye contact. She is fucking staring at me almost unnaturally while talking. She says that's because she is really interested and I am handsome.

Very seldom she bats an eye, and she never looks around nervously. Something I learned to expect from girls that are meeting a stranger taller and stronger than them, from Tinder. That has always been my experience, at least for a good 15-30 minutes before starting cracking jokes, drinking, and sharing food.

She is always smiling and looking at me almost mechanically. My sixth sense awakes, and I start probing her mercilessly.

She is a salesperson, changed her job four times in 9 years. Not in a good relationship with her brother, she doesn't know what he's doing nor she cares. She hasn't seen her parents for 1 year as well. Most girls would be telling such a thing with crying eyes, but she just brushes that off like nothing.

I ask why she moved abroad, and she tells me she is here for career and getting as high as possible. She doesn't have a plan, but she wants to get the best she can in her life. Who am I to blame that?

She gets up to go to the toilet and comes back with vodka shots. I politely refuse because ""I'm healthy"" and stick to my beer. She drinks both in the range of 5 minutes. What a woman. In retrospect I'm sure she wanbed to get me drunk.

So 1 hour passes talking shit, and I declare its time to move to our second venue.

Things get a bit heated, she is not scared of initiating contact and I keep ignoring it.

I ask what she is looking for in man and she tells me she is looking for someone with strong opinions, capable of taking decisions, that knows what to do in his life. I'm not kidding, straight TRP truths coming off her mouth. She tells me that she loved the way I texted her and that she expected me to be exactly what she's looking for. Never I have ever heard I girl even remotely mentioning this stuff so directly.

At this point I am incredibly suspicious about the whole situation.

I ask her about her ex. She says to me she has been in a 5 year relationship with a guy where she was taking all decisions and the last drop was him asking to marry her. She tells me that she was young and stupid when she met him and she didn't know better. Probably she realized he was a loser and couldn't fulfill her desires of greatness.

I ask if leaving her ex left a scar in her life. She tells me that he's the one with the scar now. Wow, I wonder what that poor guy must have been through. Not a remorse for the whole thing from her. Not a feeling. She talks about it like she changed her order at the restaurant.

Back to some small talk and I decide to do a move on her. She accepts everything like it was her plan from the beginning. She kisses me back with such an energy I am wondering if its a dream. We are almost arrived to the second venue, and I sense she would just rather go to my apartment.

A few months ago I would have killed for a girl like that. But know my instinct is saying ""warning"" so I decide to go in, take a table and order drinks.

She becomes more direct, she moves her chair next to mine, puts her legs around mine and even tries to force me kissing her by pulling my shirt. Not too strongly though, I stay laid back and don't let her take control of my actions. I'm ignoring the whole thing and kidding about her being so direct. Inside I am like ""what the fuck is happening?"".

We both like house and techno and start talking about clubs. She says she lives near one and I joke saying that must be her hunting place. She agrees. Again I get blown away by such honesty. I ask her to put a number on how many people she brought home, but she refuses strongly. I guess slut shaming is a feeling painful enough for her too.

I realize that she is the one out to have sex with me and not the opposite. She likes me physically and nothing would stop her. I get a bit scared about the unnatural situation.

Myself, not caring anymore about having sex, start gazing her, without batting an eye or saying anything. She takes on, and we just look at each other for minutes making faces. Super awkward. Until she resumes the conversation like that never happened. A normal girl would run out scared shitless.

I decide its time to prove my point and pull back completely from any physical contact.

By now her behaviour is an emotional rollercoaster. I am usually good at controlling the conversation and keeping it fun but she starts fiddling with the menu, keeps interrupting with personal attacks which go farther than your typical ""oh you're a womaniser/player"", ""oh your just out for fun"". She is annoyed and start accusing me of hating women, being a dominator, wanting girl restrained in the kitchen, etc. which I immediately diffuse by bringing up her previous behaviour.

At that point I was confident she didn't give a fuck about my feelings and I was deling with a psycopath. She also hinted that when I tried to push the fact that she was a scared little girl wearing a mask of a strong man by saying I was full of shit and she didn't give a fuck about feelings.

She finally realizes she's not getting anywhere, politely get up, pays her bill, scrounge a cigaret from the male waiter with the most innocent smile you could ever think of (I had previously told her that if she would smoke, I would leave). And goes out.

I finish my drink and leave. Walking toward the exit, I see that she is sitting at a table with a group of men. Immediately she calls me, but I smile and keep walking, knowing better to be jealous for such a poor woman. She is getting sex tonight, but she's not getting it from me.

---

I am sure that now some people will say I hit the jackpot. I found the one in a thousand and threw it away. I feel like that. That's why I spent 1h writing this post.

However, I do believe in learning from the experience of the people before me on TRP. Especially after reading so much that proven to be true.

**And I remember one straightforward and clear guideline: ""Don't put your dick in crazy"".**

Tonight my instinct said no. I was afraid I would not be strong enough and get crushed. Maybe she would do fucked up things to get me do things I didn't want to do. Or maybe I would get the wildest sex in my life. Who knows? I didn't feel ready to play with fire. That was a psychopath in real life.

Now Im sure some of you are expert enough to know how to deal from such a situation. Maybe even profit from it. It could be the closest thing to a friend with benefit if set up right.

How To Not Hate Women After Knowing All She Have Done,"I have to address who I am before I start it. I'm a 23 with STD, bitter af, my best friend is a divorced 64y/o man. I've got 2 sexual partners one of those I didn't even have sex with but she gave me a chronical STD so I do score her aswell. She who was a single mother of 4 kids, loved parties and drinking. She is not the worse I've met. My mother is an ex-single mother, married with an actual thug who raised me(the third son of three different ""fathers"") like I was his own and for that I'm eternally grateful. He, beside his past crimes unto society, have taught me how to be a man.

My ex, who I've lived with, when I was 17 and then again last year, is the standard woman of 21st century: plenty of sexual partners and sexual experiences. As I believe that must not exist secrets in a relationship I've always gave her freedom to tell me about her past. I am not here to degrade her but by the post's title you can have an idea where this is going. I am not a saint, when I first lived with her I was an affair, she was betraying her 4 year bf with me. I could say I was young, loving a girl who seemed to love me back, right after I was in a deep ass depression, but I'm no saint nor free of the guilt of my doings. I knew what I was doing. We broke up when I had to attend the navy(in my country it's obligatory) and our lives followed.

In the meantime I have even lived at the streets but when I messaged her again(3 years after our heavenly months living together) I was back at my feet, working in a hotel. We engaged, I was meant to marry her, I loved her and I can say I still do. I traveled literally 1000 miles, gave my job away and was certain to have a life with her.

Everything went well for more than 1 year, we were open to each other about everything, the time with her was amazing when it was going well but everything under the sun MUST end. Here's the thing, she at the time was a 21 full of life wishing to live her best life and I'm(was) a broken man expecting a marriage for life. The thing is woman at these times have a plan of living, and it does not include limit their sexual lives at 20-ish. She had an urge to go to parties and I hate these kind of interactions. So before she betrayed(and I am truly grateful for that, for in my country, being cheated on is a BIG deal, everyday guys who were cheated on end their so's lives for it is unforgiven) she decided to breakup our love story.

So, here's the thing, my ex-fianc√©e is not an excession, most of the girls out there wait until they are old enough to settle with a provider. All of them had some crazy sexual adventure in their, let's call ""active years"" while many guys are just trying to pull their shit together, and boy that shit is beyond unfair no matter what you do believe in. How could any, ANY men sleep with someone for ""the rest of their lives"" when you know all the shit that cute girl did in her teens? Marriage is not a goddamn option AT ALL.

To conclude I'll let a wisdom of my country for all of you who did read this til the end:

""The past of a woman is like a restaurant kitchen: if you know/meet it, you will never attend it again"".",3,1

Masculinity Amidst Madness follows in the footsteps of Bronze Age Mindset, and functions as the perfect companion piece (with forward by Bronze Age Pervert), containing practical, actionable advice for men of all ages! 

""The perfect companion piece to Bronze Age Mindset: whereas BAP used a rousing form and esoteric mysticism to excite the remnants of the masculine spirit lying dormant in the reader, toxified by modern culture, Landry identifies the components of our toxic culture, analyzing them in detail, and provides a practical, actionable battle plan to fight the vultures insistent upon men being reduced to consumer weaklings, ashamed of themselves and their heritage. Masculinity Among Madness is the next step in reclaiming the masculine soul and forging a future we were meant to inherit!"" - ""Bad"" Billy Pratt, Kill to Party

""Masculinity is in deep crisis. Most men simply don't know what it means to be a man who can protect and provide for their families. Author Ryan Landry fully understands this modern problem and has written a book that begins to repair the damage that society has wrought upon men. He eloquently explains the crisis and offers practical solutions to reignite the birthright of the Western man. Hopefully, his book will be read by the generation of young men today to block out efforts of the culture to feminize and weaken them."" ‚Äî Roosh V

Thinking Too Much,"I‚Äôm a young ass dude,a teenager in high school and I have a bitch currently.

I am naturally pretty masculine already from my upbringing in which I had to be strong for my family so I am already aggressive,confident,and unemotional. And my bitch really likes that and I found out why from this community and it makes alotta sense.

With Covid and shit goin on though I only see my shorty once or twice a week to fuck and allat,and she is basically obsessed with me so she is always hitting
Me up and shit asking how I‚Äôm doing. 

This leads up to the other day,when we were talking through text and I told her to call me. I ended up talking to her for two hours late at night. I did enjoy talking to her and shit but I do feel like it was beta and I could‚Äôve spent my time working out or doing something productive.

To get to the point,was it beta to talk to her for that long when I coulda been doing some other shit?

Just so y‚Äôall know,I got my hygiene,my looks,my frame,and my body on point and I‚Äôm always lookin for ways to make more money.So I got everything on point but I still have this bad habit of thinking too much about shit like this. I want to here some
of y‚Äôall opinions on this.  Am I overthinking?",3,1
The Societal Condition and The Shadow,"What do Nice-Guys, Daddy-Issues, Mommy-Issues, Beta males, feminist, and leftist all have in common?

***Self-Hatred.***

This includes feelings of inferiority, low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, etc.

Unfortunately comrades, these archetypes infest our land.

Making the majority, rather than the minority.

This condition has many of the masses to lead lives of quiet desperation.

They seek escapism in *""The One""*, video games, T.V, cinema, drugs, porn, and especially social media.

For example, porn tricks the brain into thinking it is banging all the women it is seeing on screen.(Source:[Porn is Bad](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-apes/201808/the-truth-about-men-and-pornography))

This all provides a false sense of security to the body, and one's subconscious.

When one is brought back to reality for the few moments after the high, the individual continues to partake in these distractions, for they carry self-hatred from either participating in such activity, refusing to self-reflect/deal with issues they are currently facing, or are currently unhappy with who they are but are too lazy to work on themselves. So the continue to seek escapism;  All leading to an increase in the hyper-reality the individual is in.

This can lead to solipsism if one is not careful.

This is where the masses reside, a place of distraction, of illusion, of hyper-reality, or as we call it over here at TRP ""The Matrix"".

**What ""The Matrix"" consist of is Oversocialization, and Surrogate activity's.**

**Oversocialization:**  Assimilated too far into society. The moral code of a selected culture is embedded in one at young age.  In order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a non-moral origin.  A good example of oversocialization at play is [waiting at a red-light](https://youtu.be/qhJSjLqHpHw?t=71) in the middle of the night, while no-one is even around.

**Surrogate activity's:** an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the sake of the ‚Äúfulfillment‚Äù that they get from pursuing the goal.

*Oversocialization* is associated with Blue-pill thinking and behavior.

*Surrogate activity's* are what peoples routines are made up of. (At least in 1st world countries) Even when one is ""Red-pilled"" they still carry on surrogate activity's however, are now self-aware, which leads to thoughts of nihilism, existentialism, or absurdism.

All this can lead to feelings of self-hatred.

**What is one to do in order to escape ""The Matrix""?**

We are forced to confront the darkest aspects of ourselves. Our shadow.

In Jungian psychology, the shadow, is hidden or unconscious aspects of oneself, both good and bad, which the ego has either repressed or never recognized.

*You* do not take a *""Red-pill""* and simply everything is better.

*You* have to confront yourself, and cut off parts of yourself that are eating at you.

*You* have to face the past experiences and now the future with truth.

*You* have to put in the work.

*You* have to go through [The Journey of Hell](https://www.forums.red/p/theredpill/250160/the_journey_through_hell).

Some may call this Shadow work, self-development, self-actualization, or re-creating oneself.

**The wisdom of this text, and the lesson one should take from it is thus...**

You must face your issues, head-on, or else they will consume you, Slowly eating away, like poison, a leech, over-riding control of your free-will.

The masses are not doing this. And it is leading to more censorship, more violence, and more self-hatred. In a mass scale, the shadow of the collective is eating away at us. Over-riding our freedoms.

# My [26F] boyfriend of 4 years [27M] just walked out on me after a video surfaced of me.

I'm just completely lost right now and don't know where to start.

I've had a very troubled upbringing. All the types of abuse you can think of, multiple foster homes etc. Drugs and sex. I'm not proud of my past. Around 21, a solid 7 years after things really went south for me, I decided to get clean out of nowhere. Since that day, I've never drunk enough to even get tipsy, or done any drugs - even though it's been incredibly hard and continues to be.

I met my boyfriend a year after I started making these changes. From the get go, I laid my cards on the table (*obviously not all of them*) and he's never been anything less than supportive. He's 100% the best thing that has happened to me and we talked like we would be married anyway - we've just assumed it will happen for the last year.

On Sunday, he was sent a gif/video over text that was undeniably me with a group of men. I'm clearly not in my senses, and I have no recollection of this happening - but would not call it out of place for where I was at that time in my life. I also wasn't even 18 at the time.

I didn't make any excuses, and felt trauma of my own that reopened the wounds from the past, but recognized this moment was about him. He wanted space and I gave it to him.

Today I get a text this morning telling me he's seen more and is truly disgusted by the person I am, and that he couldn't believe what I would do for ""other men, but not him"".

I completely understand his reaction in being disgusted and have no idea what he saw, but I'm so very confused by his second statement. We have had an incredibly healthy sex life and I've indulged in every single desire/kink he's vocalized - I don't understand how he could think that way.

I'm just a complete mess at the moment and feel like I've had a trap door open under my feet. What do I even say to him to try and fix this? I should be worried about whoever is sending him this but I can't even bring myself to think of anything other than getting him back.",100,1

Sexual Availability as a Proxy Indicator For Desire/Attraction/Commitment/Love,"Sorry about that stupid title. Basically in English, how hard and nasty your women fucks you should be taken as an indicator as to the general health of the relationship. As AWALT is real, this applies to all women. 

TLDR: If your woman isn't doing everything that you want her to do in the sack, she is not worth committing to. Why? Because they will do whatever a guy tells them to do if they are 'in love\*' with the guy. \*women are incapable of love as men understand it, it's a temporary thing for them, conditional, etc. 

Funny story on relationshipadvice. 

*"" On Sunday, he was sent a gif/video over text that was undeniably me with a group of men. I'm clearly not in my senses, and I have no recollection of this happening - but would not call it out of place for where I was at that time in my life. I also wasn't even 18 at the time.*

*I didn't make any excuses, and felt trauma of my own that reopened the wounds from the past, but recognized this moment was about him. He wanted space and I gave it to him.*

*Today I get a text this morning telling me he's seen more and is truly disgusted by the person I am,* ***and that he couldn't believe what I would do for ""other men, but not him""****.*

I've highlighted the important part. Basically a chick who was a slut before she met her betabux was outed by her friends. I think the reaction of this man is important, because it is something that comes up a lot in these jilted lover scenarios, and I'm always struck why women don't understand why men react the way her betabux did. 

He probably doesn't care the woman is a slut, honestly. He cares that he saw his woman giving some stranger a deepthroat blowjob, and he's pissed because despite all the commitment he has shown this woman, she's never tickled his balls with her tongue as he tickles her tonsils with his dick. 

For a man, the reason this is a piss off is obvious. For the women out there (tits or gtfo), the reason the BF reacted that way is: If this guy is showing you love, he wants to know you are appreciative. If he knows you used to eat the ass of guys you didn't know the name of, but won't for the guy you supposedly want to marry, it sends a message. 

That message is obvious: YOU ARE BETABUX.

So, let's go full circle here. We know that AWALT, and part of AWALT is they are sluts for guys they are attracted too. Therefore, if your girl is not a slut for you, the conclusion is obvious. She is in to you for a reason other than raw animal attraction. Which may be ok for you, but if I am going to commit resources and time to a woman, I want to know that she actually is in to me for reasons other than a bank account, as an example. 

Before you commit to a woman, make sure you vet her. How she acts in bed should be noted. I submit it is a direct indicator as to her attraction levels, which seems obvious, but a lot of guys put up with bad sex because they like the girl. Don't. 

Happy hunting.",28,1
Testing,"It's June 2020. The country is in flames. There are riots in the streets. The Federal Reserve is printing funny money like never before. Virtue signal is currently trading above beta male thirst, forcing Thots to post black box instead of ass. In times of instability and uncertainty there are many questions a man must ask. But here at the Red Pill we only ask one question. How can we use whatever is currently happening to get laid?

Now I know the RoboSpergs are going to be upset as they can't comprehend a more nuanced take than ‚ÄúRIOT GOOD‚Äù or ‚ÄúRIOT BAD"" Their feeble binary brains only understand 1s &amp; 0, on or off, good or bad. A Manichean Black and White, mindset will only confuse you and throw you into a whirlwind of Future Shock, especially in this rollercoaster of a decade. Are the Protests bad because of the coronavirus? Are the protests good because the Bill of Rights makes lockdown unconstitutional? Are the protests a giant distraction to help push voters to Joe Biden? Is it a ploy to impose martial law for the upcoming mandatory vaccine? Whatever the truth ultimately is, here at Red Pill we only care about one thing and one thing only: cumming in women's vagina holes.

If you get anything from this post it's this. Each and every crisis is a deterritorialization of established hierarchies. This is an excellent opportunity to pump you sauce between a woman's legs before society figures out a new normal and resumes it's sexual gatekeeping. So now that we have identified the opportunity, how do we use it before we lose it?

Here's the most important thing you need to understand about the current demonstrations. Unlike 1960's when people took to the streets for social change, in 2020 nobody actually cares. There are two kinds of people out in the streets right now: those who want to take edgy pictures for social media and those who riot loot and steal stolen items back and forth from each other. In the hyper-reality of 2020 almost all overarching narratives of meaning have disintegrated with time at Fukuyama's ‚Äúend of history.‚Äù What is left is a schizophrenic experience of unrelated events between the consumption of new products and new sexual experiences. As such, it is important for people to have big colorful, flashy pictures, to draw attention to themselves to show that they are in the ‚Äúknow‚Äù and as such a suitable sexual  partner. 

Women are obsessed with virtue signaling. Without babies to fixate on, their need to care for their offspring has been redirected to dogs and joggers. The past couple of months have been especially hard on women as the  Kung-Flu has locked them indoors and inhibited their production of brunch selfies and group pregame pictures where they look good but their friends look like shit. Millennial and Zoomer women are currently suffering from a severe social media attention drought which they hope to remediate via woke protest photography.
Every day of protest is comprised of a three act structure. In the first phase, girls go out and post videos of themselves on social media. The second phase is when the action starts. The third part of the night is when everyone gets tired and police enforce curfew. During act one find a suitable qt at the riot who is taking photos of herself. Tell her that you know of a place with a great view of the city to take more selfies that way you avoid the real danger of act 2. The key is to have good logistics for the pull to the sex location. in an ironic way Soros is actually helping us out because he didn't pay for post riot hotel accommodations.
Protest aren't just for finding hot sexy singles in your area, they are also an opportunity to spice up your milquetoast Tinder/Bumble with edgy action pics. For pictures, put on your best black block gear and head out to your local liberal metropolis. Try to wear cool sunglasses and a bandana across your face. A black backpack is also a must have because it makes you look like you know what you are doing; who knows what mysteries it contains? The goal here is to get some good pics of you near the action, but not so close that you can be injured, arrested, or generally implicate yourself in anyway. The best option is to make a protest PUA group. Bring a few wingmen along and pretend to be a radical faction. Don‚Äôt accept any other male protesters as they are probably employees of the state.
Have a friend come with you to snap a bunch of action shots- go for quantity here and filter through them later. A word of warning: do not make it look like you are taking photographs, it could bug out the types with lower impulse control and make them question your commitment to whatever the cause is that night. Instead, do it discretely, and snap a bunch in motion. Make it look like you are filming or livestreaming to catch police brutality or whatever. 
Try to get your photos in during late afternoon and early evening during act 3. Things will be heating up as it gets later in the day but you sure as hell do not want to be there once the sun sets. One or two hours at the protest should be sufficient to get plenty of photos and you can then safely return to your segregated neighborhood feeling good about exploiting a national tragedy for your own personal sexual satisfaction.

Is it what Humanity has become ?,"Look around you.  What do you see ?

*Look again...*

&amp;#x200B;

People slouching on their shopping cart ; out of shape and fat people drinking sodas ; teenagers and even kids head down, phone up, completely hypnotized by the *friendly* ass they'll never get ; feminine men ; women taking pictures of their breast in the toilet to get validated ;  people complaining about the only rainy day of the month, people wasting their lives living someone else's life, people throwing away their potential for short-term satisfaction and so on... 

&amp;#x200B;

How many people do you personally know that does not watch TV or play video games after work or school and work on their ~~dreams~~ goals instead ? 

Humans have never been as much lazy as we are today. 

In fact, being out of touch with reality has become the new reality. Most of the world's most major problems relate to our inability to comprehend the consequences of our actions. You've probably heard of **Climate change** or maybe **Migration and Starvation and War following it**.

But that, my friends, are only the tip of the Iceberg.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

According to *worldometers.info* we are 7.8 billion walking the earth today to the explosive expansion of our knowledge in medicine. We were 4 billion in 1974, 1 billion in 1804.

Some genius estimate we'll be 10 billion in 2050.

Somehow scientists are still trying to find cures to various illnesses and hoping to find the formula for immortality. And this is leading to the annihilation of the human race as we've heard of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

You see, Life has favored a method of replication called *natural selection* which purpose is to ultimately weed out unfavorable traits and genes. This is known as cross-breeding.

Herbert Spencer called it the *""Survival of the fittest"".* **Only those who are strong enough, be it in raw strength, intelligence or adaptability in this merciless world will pass their genes to the next generation.**

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, Life always had to fight to survive and replicate, and that's how we evolved so much. The problem is that today, **we don't have to fight anymore**, we don't face dangers anywhere, there are laws, states giving you money if you can't find jobs, there are drugs and preventive medicine like vaccines. All of this is leading to weakness. A generalized weakness.

**In fact, we live in perfect comfort.** But what we don't realize is that there is a war going on, bigger than the feminine imperative which is not even realized by the majority of the population.

The real threat here is the aggressive expansion of the human race mixed with an uncurable generalized weakness. Do you think men 200 years ago wondered what masculinity is and how to emulate it ?

&amp;#x200B;

We are living on a finite earth. Don't get me wrong, my masculine sexual strategy is to knock up as many women as I can and spread out my genes. But what I execrate is that any of my children will be able to be retarded, sick, lazy, weak, dumb, watching Netflix, not knowing what his gender is, and get money for doing nothing and get rewarded with life.

We are **bypassing** natural selection and allowing the weak to survive. And I'm not even talking of stuff like endocrine perturbator and mutagenic pollution threatening testosterone.

*""Hitlerian crap theories you fucking nazi""* 

&gt;!""Yeah sure, I've been following a Bootcamp, I can refer some friends for free, wanna join ?""!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

This degeneration of the human race is completely out of control. Masculinity is going extinct. There is an overt war going on. This is a war of attrition.

 Our pool of choice is limited. But we are fucking not helpless.

Many of our brothers have fallen and many more will fall, but as Men, we stand and fight. 

We have to lead and show the world what we are made of.  We have to save the masculine essence or alpha archetype whatever you call it from.

What is happening is a generalized and worldwide ~~shit-test~~ test run by natural selection. Are we able to live in tune with our environment ? Or are we going to spread like a virus and destroy everything we come to contact with ?

We are the product of billions of years of ruthless evolution. We can't let hundreds of years wiping out masculinity. We've been so far as the human race we can't give up now.

&amp;#x200B;

**If you are one of the Men I've described, great job gentlemen. Keep going forward !** 

If not, get the fuck up, start cultivating your masculine energies. Lift, Learn, Think, Analyze, Work towards your goals and passion, if you don't have any, find some ! This is of utter importance. Start taking cold showers, lifting, eating healthy, and sleeping enough, this is even more important than anything else. And keep going. Get standards. Don't be a slave to your emotion or to anyone else. Be your own master. Only then life will be truly enjoyable. Add value to Human Life. This is one of the most gratifying things you can do.

This is not easy. But you've got to realize life was never meant to be easy. It was meant to survive at all costs.",80,1

Horrible things can hit you at any time. The only defence is having strength in every facet you can to weather the storm - that's your duty as a man," 

**Summary**: Resilience comes from lived experience and how you choose to build your life

**Intro:**

If you're here then you've already got some challenge in your life - women don't like you, you have no father figure, you have no friends, etc. But some challenges aren't so passive. Sometimes everything can be going seemingly well then out of nowhere everything collapses into the unknown. I want to share some personal experiences of where significant challenges have been thrown at me, and how I've not viewed them as setbacks, but as an opportunity to push myself into something more formidable each time. My end result is a life where I'm currently happy and satisfied, but where I also know that no matter what befalls in me, I'll be ready to take it on and win.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Challenge Free Upbringing:**

Without boring you, I was smart as a kid. Incredibly tall for my age, was reasonably popular in my social circles (but by no means was I the alpha, athlete etc) and coasted. My motto was why put the effort in if I can do the bare minimum. I coasted through school, I coasted through sixth form (UK  here) and I coasted into Uni. I had a strong family unit, a girlfriend from 18, no major dramas in my life, a decent degree ahead of me, but all I did was sit on my ass playing video games all day. I didn't need to work for anything. Life was easy, but I wasn't happy.

My first year of uni I sat in my dorm room for a year skipping lectures, going home 10 miles away on weekends to see my girlfriend, and playing video games every weekday. I passed my first year, but I'd wasted it. I was 6ft 7, 154lbs, I'd stopped martial arts training that I'd been doing since 12, and I was socially anxious. I hated myself for wasting all that time when I could have been out making something of my time there. I swore to myself after I finished first year I'd go back to living at home and get my life together whilst travelling into uni. 

Well I started doing the Insanity program, restarted martial arts training, but everything else still sucked. I was a loser and I knew it, so did everyone around me that knew me. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Example Number 1 - Suicide:**

While I was in my second year my dad had been diagnosed with depression. It was only mild. I had moved on to some crappy weight training so sometimes we'd workout together; really it was the first time in a long time we'd had something in common. He was always very blue collar and I wasn't orientated that way. 

In December that year, he woke up one morning to fuel up the car. I got up late and was skipping lectures as usual but was working through some coursework I had due that week. My mum came in to say she was concerned as he hadn't come home yet and he was due to leave for work 5 minutes ago. I wrote it off and half hour later she came back in tears as he still hadn't returned. She rang his work whilst I checked my social media for any local accidents in case he was stuck in traffic (he never carried a phone). The first post on my wall was an article about a car fire down the road from us. Somehow we both knew. I called my grandparents, the police, and within 10 minutes it was confirmed it was my dad in the car.

Long story short he'd gotten up that morning, gone to buy fuel, doused himself in it in a layby 2 miles from home, and set himself on fire. 

Naturally we were devastated. There'd been no warning, no note, no immediate cause. Life was no longer easy; this was my challenge. 

In the months that followed I dropped out of uni for that year, arranged family finances, knuckled down into exercising routinely, and began putting down the building blocks of becoming formidable as a man. I began coaching martial arts, I returned to uni and became President and head instructor of my martial arts club, I completed my degree 2 years later with a 2:1 in a STEM field. I was the rock for my family. I maintained my relationship with my girlfriend at the time, and ultimately I was forced to rapidly grow up.

I could have been a victim. Christ knows many wouldn't have blamed me for breaking down and hiding in my room for the next 6 months, but what does that achieve?

All of this was shaped by my mantra that everyday had to, in some way, make me a better man than before. I had to rise to protect my family; I was the only man left. Some days, especially the early days, I couldn't think about the day ahead. I'd start smaller; what can I manage in the next hour? What can I do in the next 5 minutes? I couldn't think about the funeral, but I could get up and take a shower. Then I could get my suit on. Then I could go sit in the car. Then I could walk in behind the coffin. etc etc, you get the idea. *Break insurmountable challenges down into their manageable chunks.*

The gym was my meditation, it built confidence and the halo effect of that pushed me into a successful career in the pharmaceutical industry. I was making ¬£30k plus bonus and benefits in my first job out of uni which was already more than my mother had ever made. It was challenging, I regularly felt anxious or burnt out, but I always came back to the same mantra. *You've lived through worse.*

What happened to us was terrible, but if it hadn't of happened I would have failed my degree, been depressed and hopeless, and would have been a pathetic excuse of a man. Whilst I'd still love to have my dad back, I wouldn't change the effects it's had on me since; I needed it. It made me. All that upset and anger I turned into fuel. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Example two - 7 year relationship breakdown**

I'd been aware of the redpill from about 3 years into my relationship, but generally was more interested in the debate than trying to live it. I took on the messages of self improvement as they aligned closely with my headspace after losing my dad, but in terms of the approaches to dating/LTRing etc I largely left those to one side. I'm not here to teach you how to be an alpha/chad etc, I'm not claiming to be, but there's something to be learned from this experience too.

I'd been with this HB 5/10 for 7 years by this point and while I'd massively improved over the previous few years, she'd largely remained stationary. Whilst I'd say we were probably equals in the start, there was a growing gap between our outlooks and motivations and we could both feel it. We (stupidly) bought a house together last summer despite me missing obvious red flags and 4 months later I realised I hated living with her. Laziness, weight gain, being unable to hold down a job, and most importantly being  a bad role model for potential future children, meant I had a big blowout with her.

Ultimately I broke up with her, then when I cleared out my laptop she was borrowing the next day I saw outlook notifications showing she'd booked a hotel room with her boss for the next night. Despite me splitting with her the day before, I was fuming; clearly this had been going on before we split. I was angry and upset for about a week, but again that old mantra came back. *I've been through worse and everyday I have to be better than the last.*

Now this post is getting long so I'll spare all of the death threats from her boss, legal issues of her claiming property that wasn't hers etc. Suffice to say she did everything she could to make the following 3 months as unpleasant as possible, despite me having done nothing wrong throughout the entire process. AWALT I guess. They claimed I was intimidating, abusive, controlling, everything they could but thankfully everyone that knew me knew it wasn't possible, even some of her family still chat to me in the street as they know it's all false. I kept a cool head, I knew far more than her and her family in regards to handling the mortgage dissolution and similar legalities. She had let her dad deal with everything as she was incapable, and I ran circles around him.

I took it again, one day at a time. I approached each problem in chunks: I can't afford the mortgage on my own - get a better paying job. I've never dated before - Don't waste time thinking, go and do. I'd put on some minor bodyfat whilst setting up the house - get your fat ass back to working out and double the effort with all the time you've now got. 

As a result, I nearly tripled my salary within 2 months to ¬£80k a year, I'm now 6ft 7 and 230lbs with a BF of around 12% currently, I've dated around a bit and I'm seeing a girl that adds something meaningful to my life, and I have a strong unit of family and friends behind me. The best revenge is a life worth lived as they say. For 3 months that was my fuel, I wanted to 'win' the breakup but really I already had, the gap between us was too much for either of us to be happy. Beyond that I had a new found satisfaction from my life that I hadn't felt in years. 

There were two main things here that were essential in me succeeding.

1. I still had that mantra - *I've lived through worse*
2. I had been very careful to build up the 'pillars' in my life to provide me with a strong structure in case something new went wrong

**The Pillars:**

These may differ based on your priorities but here are mine:

1. Physical Health
2. Finances
3. Family
4. Friends
5. Relationship
6. Hobbies

You'll notice that across both examples, one of these pillars has completely crumbled. If I had no other pillars, or if they were too weak, my whole world would come tumbling down and crush me. I lost my family pillar for a while so I fell onto physical health and hobbies. I lost my relationship so I fell onto finances and family/friends. It doesn't matter what your pillars are; if you invest in them they'll hold you up when 2 or even 3 fail. 

If I was to plot a line graph of relative success against time, and each pillar had it's own coloured line, you'd see a trend. Every time one pillar fell to zero, the others would rapidly climb up higher to account for the net loss. Let's say we ranked it from 0 to 10 for success. If I drop 8 points in family, you best believe those 8 points are going to be distributed across the remaining pillars ASAP because I refuse to allow anything to set me back. If we tracked my overall satisfaction over time, you'd see that with every sharp drop there was an even sharper increase that follows it. 

**Conclusion:**

* **Horrible things can hit you at any time. The only defence you have is having strength in every facet you can to weather the storm and that's your duty as a man**
* **Take on seemingly insurmountable challenges in bite-sized chunks. If you can't handle the day break it down to what you can handle in the next few minutes.**
* **You improve BECAUSE of challenges, they're not setbacks, they make you more resilient**
* **Every new worst case scenario makes you more competent ready for the next one**
* **If you build your house strong enough, it doesn't matter if one of the walls gets blown down, you still have the roof over your head to shelter you while you rebuild it.**",49,1
"""Female Dating Strategy: a breeding ground for Female Supremacists"" - A data driven story. Feature on Fox News, ABC, NBC and CBS.",[removed],0,1
A New Biological Entity: Modern Women,"So I was thinking about this for some time. 

What's the primary goal of the human nature, on a biological level? Reproduction, of course. The will to breed, as a biological factor, manifests itself as one of the strongest psychological motivators, for biology is inherently tied up with the human mind. 

Now, we should consider that the role that men has on such goal is completely different than that of the women. The function that men has (or had) is to provide for his family and actively participate in the world as a catalyst of progress and movement, whereas women is (or was) supposed to operate based on the results of such interaction between the collective men and his time. But in the end everything is all about reproduction and the maintenance of a status quo to sustain order for further generations.

Now, that's all fine. It's human nature, and women were always satisfied with that, BACK THEN. They felt honored to participate in the progress of their cultural organisms and that was beautiful, for it embraces our human nature and allows a symbiotic process to arise. 

But, what happened after the birth of contraceptive methods? Well, a new biological entity was created: the modern ""women"". Such women has now the power to simply avoid the natural consequences of sex and, as result, they will have to look for something to compensate for such an important role they had always fulfilled, but now don't. So, sex starts to get glamorized and, since women are the ones who say the final word, they'll now have the power to use sex as a means to solely self-indulge and to affirm their ""value"" (appearance-based, ofc).

Now, what's the consequence of such thing, for men? Well, I'd love to write about that some other time, but I have work to do now.

We're on dark times, fellas.",12,1

How to plan your training,"\*\*Introduction\*\*

We all know by now that everyone should lift and there have been hundreds if not thousands of posts about it by now. The only problem is that these are either purely motivational in nature or tell you outdated shit like ""just do SSLP"" or ""hurr durr 5x5"". This might have been great advice in 2010, but the quality of common and academic training knowledge has come a long way since then. In this post, I will try to give a more theoretical approach to building a program or just reviewing the program your about to do.

I will assume that the reader knows about RPE or RIR. Since it is simply a superior way to measure effort than random percentages. If you don't others have written at length about it.

\+\*\*""Pyramid of performance""\*\*  
\+\*\*Variation\*\*  
\+\*\*Rest days\*\*  
\+\*\*Periodization\*\*  
\+\*\*Templates for strength or bodybuilding\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Specificity\*\*

When trying to learn anything in life specificity is the most important thing there is. Humans are not general learners and while some skills or adaptions might carry over from one task to another, in general, they do not. This means that if you want a big squat you NEED to squat, if you want big arms you must train arms and if you want to get stronger you must lift heavier weights. This is usually called Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demand (SAID).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Overload\*\*

As humans adapt to stimuli we run into what is known as the repeated bout effect. Every time a stimulus of any kind is imposed on the body, it adapts and in turn, becomes a little more resistant to that stimulus. The way to solve this problem is by steadily increasing the stimulus over time. This is known as Overload. A few common techniques for this is to increase weight, decrease rest, add sets, increase effort (RPE), slow the tempo down, pauses mid-movement, supersets, etc. basically the exercises need to become harder over weeks, months and years.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Volume and intensity\*\*

Okay! now we know what to do.  We need to choose what we want to become better at and then make it harder over time. In the case of hypertrophy, it turns out that there is no significant difference in training outcomes as long as one performs between 5-30 reps per set at an appropriate intensity. This means choosing how many reps to perform becomes only a matter of practicality, stimulus to fatigue ratio, and personal taste if one's goal is to increase muscle mass. But how hard and how much? In general, most people see the most results between 10-20 sets per muscle group per week. With the caveat that novices might get results with as little as one set and some highly trained individuals might be able to benefit from even more. The intensity these sets should be performed at is in general between RPE 7-10. where most training should probably be close or at RPE 8. Heavier exercises like squats, Bench press, and deadlifts should, in general, be performed at lower average RPE than lighter exercises.

In general the higher the average RPE the fewer sets per week. A general strategy is to start a training cycle in the lower end of the 10 sets and then increase the volume with one or two sets per week as long as one does not have DoMs.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*""Pyramid of performance"" (PoP)\*\*

All types of performance training are ordered in a pyramid type structure. The more complex the type of performance the more parts are going to make up the pyramid. The parts are going to be the sub-skills that allow you to perform and how large the part depends on its importance. In bodybuilding, the base would be work capacity (how much training can you do and recover from) and then the hypertrophic training itself would be the top. For a powerlifter, this pyramid would also include a layer of ""general strength"" training and then a layer of maximal strength or specific strength at the top.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Variation\*\*

Variation is a tool used to prolong the time before diminishing returns sets in. In bodybuilding, this can be done by just changing exercises. Since the goal is to train muscles. While if strength is the goal it is usually done by modifying the exercise. Examples are adding pauses, tempos, RoM or changing technique (ex. High bar or low bar, sumo or conv deadlift etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Rest days\*\*

The amount of rest a person needs between training highly depends on the advancement of the individual and how hard each session is. In general, it is probably recommended to have at least one day every week with full rest.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Periodization\*\*

The goal of periodization is both to stave off diminishing returns from the repeated bout effect and to train all the different training parameters we need for our performance goal (PoP) in a focused way. There are many different types of periodization. All with different strengths and weaknesses. I will not detail these here. But what the reader needs to understand is that they all, in general, take the trainee through some type of training block of either constant or increasing training volume. A general block will consist of two or three of the following types of weeks.

\*\*Light weeks\*\*: All blocks, in general, starts off with one of these. Light weeks are what are normally referred to as deloads. Their goal is to drop systemic and local fatigue and to resensitize the athlete for more training. They in general consist of about half or less the volume of a medium week.

\*\*Medium weeks\*\*: These are your bread and butter of training and where you will see the most of your results. They consist of a good amount of training but are not overwhelming. They should have volume in such an amount that a person can take 4-6 of these weeks before needing a light week.

\*\*Heavy week\*\*: The gaols of these weeks might either be to squeeze out the last gains in a training block or allow a person to adapt to doing more training. They are in general placed at the end of training blocks and consist of more volume than a medium week.

In general, each training block needs to be significantly different in some way then the block coming before it. This means varying either rep ranges, exercises used or maybe even the focus of the block.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Templates for strength or bodybuilding\*\*

We have now reached a time where we need to choose a structure for our training week.

\*\*Bodybuilding\*\*: The only thing we really have to take into consideration here is that at least two times a week frequency seems to give the best results. One can structure this in many ways. Some popular ones are PPL two times a week with one rest day (push-pull-legs) (grouping exercise by movement pattern), upper-lower two times a week (grouping days by which part of the body is used), or any variation of training muscle groups together where one hit all groups two times a week.

Exercise selection does not really matter here. But one should remember that the goal is to train a specific muscle and not just to move weight.

\*\*Strenght training\*\*: The most popular and maybe most effective template for performance-based training is a heavy-light-medium structure of training. This type of structure allows the athlete to have hard overloading training days and then recover between while still having some productive training.

Let us produce an example of a 3 days a week powerlifting type template. it would contain

Heavy squad (competition style with belt) - light squat (focus on technique or training the muscles used, use higher reps and harder variations to lighten the load) - medium squat (usually same or close to the rep ranges as the heavy day, but with a variation)

Heavy deadlift (same as with squat) - medium deadlift (same as with squats)

now you probably don't need to deadlift 3 times a week unless you are very good at deadlifting. So we use the light deadlift as a press instead.

Bench follow this same pattern and we could now structure our weeks as:

\*\*Day 1\*\*: HS - MB - MD  
\*\*Day 2\*\*: HB - MS - LB  
\*\*Day 3\*\*: HD - LB - LS

We now have a full training week, where the dedicated might add cardio (two times of at least 20 min per week is recommended for general health.) and some extra training for arms and back and w/e on the other days.",30,1
Societal Addiction to Your Productivity,"#Civilizations Require Cheap Labor
There isn't a civilization on Earth that was built without cheap labor. Sumerians, Egyptians, Babylonians, Romans, Chinese, Persians, the Greeks, Eastern Indians, Aztecs, Brazilians, Canadians, Japanese, Koreans, Celts, Mongolians, the Maori,, Western feudalism had serfs and peasants, all of which were exploited to build the civilizations that exist today.

Even today, with slavery viewed as fundamentally abhorrent, there are modern countries that still have slaves, like in North Korea where it is estimated that 10% of the population is enslaved.

Conscription, the forced participation in the military, is the usurpation of your labor for the state's benefit, in many places not only is service compulsory (required or you are punished or denied participation in society), but men are forced to work on projects that may have nothing to do with military service.

Prison labor (Read the 13th amendment to the US Constitution,) is nothing but a sham where the vast prison population of the USA (larger than any other nation on Earth, which is also almost entirely male,) is forced to work or suffer draconian punishments like indefinite solitary confinement, and they are paid next to nothing with the average being $0.90 per hour worked in Federal prisons.

Indentured servitude, or wage/debt slavery, being forced to work indefinitely just to be able to survive, is a form of coercive financial control. (Hint: Never accrue debt unless it is secured by real property or tangible assets.) The millions upon millions of the impoverished are required in order to keep society functional for those that are not.

#Male Taxes and Expendability
It is well known that men are net payers of government taxes, without men, societal benefits like socialized healthcare, infrastructure construction and maintenance, social welfare programs like food stamps, unemployment benefits, and social security, the postal service, and more would simply not exist. Women, as a class, are net *beneficiaries* of the social engine, meaning men transfer their hard earned wealth to women via the government *every single day.*

No men, no roads, no roads, no cars. No men, no food stamps, more starvation. No men, no unemployment insurance, more homeless, impoverished, and enslaved.

Child support and marital alimony are both wage slavery. Have a kid, be forced to work for at least 20 years- even if you were forced (raped,) lied to about birth control, inseminated herself via a blowjob or fished a condom out of the trash, or merely claimed you were the father even though you aren't.

Society cannot *afford* to make men's lives better by providing for social services that would help men. DV shelters, mental health programs, education and training opportunities, all of these things cost money, money that is extorted by the cheap and plentiful labor of men. By pumping money extorted from men back into men, it increases the costs of the social programs and makes them ineffective.

Men must be inherently expendable, or the costs of society as it is becomes unsustainable. The only men that are not expendable are the top 20%, the 80% are destined to a life of hard labor, imprisonment, mental illness, wage slavery via child support and marital alimony, debt slavery due to credit cards and consumerist culture, and no help to improve their lives beyond the *premise* of assistance. And once their productive value has run its course, they are forgotten.


#Enjoy the Decline
Do not get married. Marriage is a bad social deal to exchange male productivity for a chance at procreation. Even then, there's no guarantees of reproduction, for as many as 3 of 10 children are raised by fathers thinking it is their child. With no-fault divorce, you can be bankrolling the 20%'s offspring for the rest of your life. Practice bodily control and use physical contraception that you can control. Pull out even when you use a condom, and learn how to control your orgasms. Never give a woman access to your semen under any circumstances. It is also the easiest method to enslave you for decades. If you father children, do so with women who cannot locate you or know who you are. Let one of the 80% bear the burden of your offspring. There will be many women who desire your lineage, let them work for you and lever the societal underpinnings in your favor.

Exploit the cheap labor and desperation of the 80%. Start a business, pay them pennies and reap the benefits of their hard labor. If that is unfeasible, buy stocks in corporations. They have mastered the exploitation of the 80% for their own benefit, and through ownership in these behemoths you own a portion of the cheap labor that is summarily exploited. Save and invest a minimum of 20% of every dollar you earn the moment you make money. Buying slaves via stock investing is arguably the best investment you could ever make. They'll work hard and tirelessly for you, and not even realize that you are reaping the benefits of their enslavement.

Barter and use cash wherever you can, not only is cash less traceable, but you can reap significant savings by negotiating under-the-table pricing for services you desire. No taxes, you save money, they save money, and everyone benefits. If you know skills that can be traded for things you need, find people that need your ability and exchange your work for theirs.

Your life is as free, or as controlled, as you desire it to be.",40,1

"The Reddit Admin Operate in Bad Faith, They Lurk in the Shadows to Generate Post-Hoc Rationalizations for Ideological Censorship. A Proof and Challenge to Reddit Admin","There isn't much I can say that most of you don't already know. We've been hard at work on a replacement infrastructure because the writing has been on the wall for many years. TRP and TRP-adjacent subreddits will not have a home for long on Reddit. https://TRP.red and https://Forums.red 

Reddit's administrators are by far the most incompetent people I have ever witnessed. Their proclivity for censoring topics with which they disagree has been just one of many nails in the coffin that is Reddit. 

Those familiar with chess know that counter-intuitive moves are not always for the purpose they appear. Sometimes a pawn is sacrificed for a greater, long-term gain or position. It would be naive to suggest that there wasn't method to some of their madness as they set about destroying community after community in a desperate effort to appease the ever-fickle advertising dollar. To suggest otherwise would unfairly discredit them when there are plenty of valid reasons to suspect their idiocy. 

My critique of Reddit is far deeper than a superficial claim that they're just booger-eaters and hate free speech. I think if we treat the subject honestly, we can find a much deeper ideological problem: one that transcends the Silicon Valley giants and their ilk. 

Deleting communities, issuing shadow bans, consolidating powers, and censoring topics are *prima facie* damaging to the community at large. There is little argument that these destructive policies, at the very least, damage the relationship with the members of the affected communities. But it‚Äôs not a stretch to suggest there is collateral damage, damaging the faith of all bystanders whose belief in Reddit's dedication to free-speech is already in short supply.

Surely, then, Reddit‚Äôs rationale for such actions is that they only cause minor, short-term damage in exchange for greater long-term gains. However, if this were true, one might think a company as dependent on the community as Reddit would treat major censorship events with a touch of nuance and at least an air of transparency and good faith?

On the contrary, in repeated events, this is not what has occurred. There are multiple failures of the Reddit administration I wish to highlight. I think the greatest of all, we will demonstrate, is their hubris in believing they've kept their true motivations somehow clandestine as they hobble together post-hoc rationalizations, inconsistent excuses, and poorly-conceived policy statements which now adorn the gravestone pages of the very communities that made Reddit successful in the first place.

**Communication with Community Leaders**

If you run your own moderately large forum on Reddit‚Äôs platform, you are likely no stranger to Reddit‚Äôs one-way communication style with community leaders. They like to submit drive-by messages to the moderation teams, often with a cryptic or misleading rebuke for the latest rule violation that the subreddit is responsible for. Often, this rule is not clearly understood or defined. This is by design.

The very notion that moderators are responsible for the actions of what community members post is asinine. Given the lack of tools afforded to moderators, it is impossible to know if members posting offending content are even members of the community at all, or if they are outsiders, posting content in an effort to defame a forum. Moderators are not given the ability to see membership status, identifiers that might link them to other sockpuppet accounts, or any signifiers of standing within a community.

Removing offending content is the only tool at a moderator‚Äôs disposal. It‚Äôs a hammer when all we have are screws. Until the moment a comment is removed, it remains for all to see.

Despite ample man-power and free time, it is virtually impossible to remove all offending posts. There can be hundreds of thousands of comments to sort through, we cannot always see every comment if they are not flagged by the community. But more deviously, the rules are not clearly defined, so even if we see the offending comment, rule-breaking material is subjective and we may not actually believe it to be rule-breaking.

An example of this comes from early in TRP‚Äôs days on Reddit, when ‚Äúbrigading‚Äù was the big bad no-no of the season. Communities posting cross-links from other communities were accused of brigading when the users following the links would participate in the conversation and voting in the target community. This was considered rule-breaking behavior and put a subreddit in jeopardy. 

The problem is that Reddit, by design, is a collection of numerous communities on one site with a shared login. It is designed in such a way that visiting multiple communities and participating isn‚Äôt just a byproduct of the way the home page is laid out, it‚Äôs the main feature of the multi-topic website.

If users decide a topic interests them and they join in voting / discussion, this is encouraged as this is the basic design of Reddit. 

This is where the impossible rules of Reddit began. Community leaders were expected to prevent users from participating across communities on a website designed for participating across communities with absolutely NO tools to do so. We were unable to prevent outsiders from participating because on Reddit, no user is an outsider. You can join and participate on any forum you wanted! 

Moderators got together and voluntarily created and implemented a CSS hack to prevent users from participating if the link followed was a ‚ÄúNo Participation‚Äù link (np.reddit.com). This was easily circumvented as the CSS design was optional and could be turned off, and it required other subreddits to comply by requiring their users to add the ‚Äúnp‚Äù prefix to all crosslinks. Incredible amounts of effort on everybody‚Äôs part because Reddit admin were wholly unable to implement any sort of feature to assist. And rightfully so, given that they had spent their entire development efforts in designing a website to do exactly the opposite!

Despite these voluntary measures, subreddits began being shuttered by Reddit admin because of ‚Äúbrigading,‚Äù despite there being no official rule against it, no tools to prevent it, and the persistence of free-will among the users. Mod teams were being held responsible for the actions of some users, and it was impossible to know if the users themselves were acting in bad faith as an attempt to shutter subreddits!

We contacted Reddit‚Äôs admin team for clarification on what constituted brigading, what actions we could or should be expected to take, and what would put us in good standing to prevent being shuttered.

A one sentence reply was given to our team ‚Äújust follow the rules.‚Äù

At this point, it was quite clear that the Reddit admin had disdain for its communities and users. They did not want compliance, they wanted a rationalization for removal. Brigading was an excuse, not a reason. The only thing we could do was literally ban the word ‚ÄúReddit‚Äù and the subreddit linking phrase, to prevent ALL Reddit links from appearing. This was the only way to prevent being shuttered by the admin for their ridiculous and unevenly applied rules.

The conflicting rules and poor communication plagues Reddit to this day, with more impossible standards and poorly defined rules being used against communities, even months after their last post (-r-the_donald).

The hallmark of the Reddit admin is that they contact a community *after* they‚Äôve decided your users broke the rules too much, to inform you that they will be taking action to either replace the mod team (with ideological replacements) or completely shutter the community (and all similar communities that may pop up). 

These excuses include comments that may have slipped through moderation. Reddit admin will comb through years of old posts to find offending comments that may only have 1 or 2 upvotes (or heck, even downvotes). They‚Äôll use these missed items as evidence that the community as a whole is rule breaking and cannot be trusted on the platform. We‚Äôve seen it in action time and time again. Comments or posts that don‚Äôt even reflect the attitude or demeanor of the subreddit, clearly made by outsiders (perhaps plants by Reddit themselves), and there goes the community.

For example: Reddit claims the_donald was removed for anti-cop sentiments. There are numerous examples of death threats against cops all across reddit today, including subreddits dedicated to it (r-Bad_Cop_No_Donut)

Reddit‚Äôs justification for shuttering, censoring, or quarantining subreddits is usually marred with logical inconsistencies and poorly conceived constructions on loose gravel. As they apply their rules like a spoiled child with a magnifying glass rules over his kingdom of ants, the rest of the community takes note. 

Enough people notice these inconsistencies and understand, these aren‚Äôt rules, these aren‚Äôt rule breakers. These are ideologues giving half-justifications for their activism. 

They tend to fall back on the same old crutches that Silicon Valley has been using for the past decade. It‚Äôs for advertising revenue. We want to be attractive to advertisers.

This is demonstrably false- as less than a year after TRP was ‚Äúquarantined‚Äù we saw ads re-appear just as they were before. Advertisers, as it turns out, are not actually afraid of controversy. They just pretend to be in public to avoid backlash for terrible things.

See, Facebook itself is home to many awful things. Terrorists organize, insane people live broadcast torturing a Trump supporter, fake news is everywhere, and groups dedicated to every cause, controversial or not, all call FB a home.

Advertisers know they want to be where the eyeballs are. If NIKE advertises on FB it‚Äôs not because of the flat earth society. Likewise, when a brand gets on the home page of Reddit, it‚Äôs not an explicit endorsement of the gonewild community in which internet stars put sharpies in their butts. The latest Trolls movie is not explicitly endorsing a subreddit dedicated to cartoon girls with dicks. But such a sub does exist. 

It doesn‚Äôt take a rocket scientist to know that it‚Äôs not about controversial content- as there‚Äôs plenty of that on Reddit that doesn‚Äôt jive with Disney yet they still advertise there. It‚Äôs about ideological disagreement. 

And Reddit is well aware, there‚Äôs no such thing as bad press. Every minor controversy that hits the news gets more exposure. *There‚Äôs this awful subreddit dedicated to shocking stuff- it‚Äôs so bad! Don‚Äôt go there and look!*

They come for the controversy, stay for the kitten pictures.

If Reddit‚Äôs goal was to maximize viewership, courting controversy but keeping an arm‚Äôs length from the content itself would be a recipe to become the #1 website in the world in no time. 

Standing for free speech, Reddit could easily make the broad comment that they do not censor legal free speech, and that it‚Äôs a shame that such content exists, and ‚Äúcheck out our puppies subreddit.‚Äù

**Free-fucking-advertising.**

Reddit‚Äôs actions betray them. Every time they take action, it is clear that they don‚Äôt believe the very words they say. 

When Reddit quarantined TRP, they put a message on our page saying ‚ÄúThis community is quarantined: It is dedicated to shocking or highly offensive content. For information on positive masculinity, please see the resources available at Stony Brook University‚Äôs Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities.‚Äù They included a link to Stony Brook.

They explicitly endorsed Stony Brook‚Äôs Masculinities whose executive director was Michael Kimmel at the time. **One of Michael Kimmel‚Äôs [crowning achievements attempting to debunk that men can be  victims of domestic violence]( https://vawnet.org/sites/default/files/assets/files/2016-10/GenderSymmetry.pdf).** He goes on to suggest that some evidence is simply false, that female-on-male violence is just different, and that it is men who lose control, women are provoked.
From an interview with [Cassie Jaye](https://youtu.be/63I4d7y3Hn4?t=11m43s):
&gt;It is not true, [‚Ä¶] that there's gender symmetry in domestic violence. That women hit men as much as men hit women.
An except from my rebuttal to Reddit‚Äôs Admin:
&gt;There is overwhelming proof that [men are victims of domestic violence](http://www.aliesq.com/2017/03/23/women-initiate-domestic-violence/) at least as much as women, if not more. Controlling for [all violence, men surpass women as victims entirely,](https://www.statista.com/statistics/423245/us-violent-crime-victims-by-gender/) making the distinction of ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù misleading when men are by all means the target of the majority all violence and the victims of **[almost all murders]( https://www.statista.com/statistics/251877/murder-victims-in-the-us-by-race-ethnicity-and-gender/)** No biggie, Michael Kimmel, it‚Äôs an easy oversight to make **WHEN YOU HATE MEN**. 

&gt;Reddit tells us that Stony Brook should give us insight into positive masculinity, but Stony‚Äôs front page only has one reference to positive masculinity in the fight against domestic violence. And that‚Äôs for men to join as [allies in preventing violence against women.]( https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/csmm/pdf/Men%20as%20Allies%20White%20Paper.pdf) That‚Äôs right men, **FUCK YOU THAT YOU MAKE UP 78% OF MURDER VICTIMS, FUCK YOU THAT YOU MADE UP 59% OF VIOLENT CRIME VICTIMS, FUCK YOU THAT [93% OF WORKPLACE DEATHS ARE MEN]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_fatality)** Yes, that‚Äôs right. /u/spez thinks that little of you that he wants your masculinity to be defined not by fighting these truths, but by sacrificing yourself to prevent violence against women.

Needless to say, this was not a shining moment for Reddit‚Äôs ideological team. They made-up excuse they used as part of their censorship campaign was so poorly researched that it was obvious at first glace what Reddit was up to.

About a week later, [Michael Kimmel was accused of sexual harrassment]( https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/15/us-womens-rights-campaigner-accused-of-sexual-harassment) and stepped down from board of gender equality campaign group. Stony Brook themselves have distanced themselves and [removed the group‚Äôs page from their site.]( https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/csmm/index.html)

Despite our team asking privately and publicly for comment from Reddit‚Äôs team, their tacit endorsement of male abuse went unaddressed. We also asked repeatedly for comment on what the offending material on our subreddit was, but they never replied. They never gave us the tools to resolve the issues, they never told us what rule was broken or what we could do to fix it.

Instead, they saw the stunning public indictment of Kimmel, and quietly removed reference to Stony Brook from our quarantine message. They fucked up, and they realized it.

Reddit‚Äôs censorship was ideological in nature, not a fair and balanced application of rules, we see this misapplication of justice across many different subreddits and communities. 

Reddit‚Äôs userbase is waking up to it. They notice the problems and inconsistencies. They notice the stark lack of transparency of the admin. They notice how poorly conceived the excuses are. It‚Äôs impossible to ignore.

Reddit can‚Äôt help but sound duplicitous in their rare communications on the announcements sub. Each announcement is followed by hundreds of comments asking why the inconsistencies in their policy exist. Most recently, reddit made another announcement, enabling hatespeech as long as it was against whites. We have to assume this was created by a child with no understanding of the world around him:

&gt;While the rule on hate protects such groups, it does not protect all groups or all forms of identity. For example, the rule does not protect groups of people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate. ‚Äì[Now Edited Source]( https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951)

This language was quickly changed but is documented [here](http://archive.is/SXgaV). 

Between the obvious excuses made to justify ideological censorship, the impossible rules for communities, the inconsistent application of said rules, and the lack of communication from Reddit‚Äôs admin, it is very, very clear that this is not ineptitude. This is bad faith by definition. This is an example of a group that absolutely hates their users and wishes they would leave.

Reddit is dying, and Reddit‚Äôs admin are killing it to serve an ideological master that is antithetical to free speech and incompatible with success.

My public challenge to prove I‚Äôm 100% right:

Reddit, you have an opportunity to publicly prove me wrong. First, apologize to our members for denying male victims. Second, publicly state exactly the terms of conditions we broke, with examples of offending material, and outline exactly what changes would need to be made to remove the quarantine.

Then, follow through and stay true to your word.

You have an opportunity to show good faith. Silence will mean I‚Äôm right.",123,1

The power of your semen,"The secret of health lies in the preservation of this vital force. Whoever wastes this energy cannot have physical, mental, moral and spiritual development.

Continence is not harmful. It saves energy. It gives immense strength and peace.

How To Get Women To Invest In You,"Emotional investment marks the difference between chasing a girl and being chased by a girl. 

As powerful as this concept is, it‚Äôs a subtle idea that few men understand. But **once you learn how to get women to emotionally invest in you, your dating life will completely change - you won‚Äôt be picking women up, they‚Äôll be picking you up.**

&amp;nbsp;

##What Is Emotional Investment?

&amp;nbsp;

We become emotionally invested in someone when they represent a potential source of value to us. 

This investment magnifies when we are uncertain whether we can get that value (I.E. You want to sleep with a girl, but she gives you mixed signals).

We can break down emotional investment down to four main factors:

- Your superficial value (fame, physical appearance, etc.).

- The value of being around you (the emotions you make her feel).

- The sense that you are less invested in her than she is in you.

- The effort she puts in to get value from you (I.E. sex or approval).

(The first two factors are explained in the following articles: https://www.modernseduction.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-sub-communication-the-secret-language-of-sexual-attraction/ ,https://www.pualingo.com/emotional-value/)

&amp;nbsp;
##The Sense That You Are Less Invested In Her Than She Is In YouÔªø

&amp;nbsp;

When you‚Äôre talking to a girl, there is, of course, physical space between you and her. 

Less obviously, there is also emotional space between you and her. 

If you were to get too physically close to a girl before she‚Äôs comfortable, she would naturally want to retract and get some distance. The same is true if you take up too much of a girl‚Äôs emotional space.

You‚Äôve probably met people in your life who take up too much of your emotional space:

- A family member who tells long stories without noticing that you are bored out of your mind.

- A friend who talks for five minutes before letting you get a few words in edgewise, only to then talk for another five minutes straight.

- A homeless person who started talking to you, and even though you politely hinted you didn‚Äôt want to talk, they kept going without noticing.
Ôªø
ÔªøThe above are all examples of what it looks like when someone takes up too much of your emotional space. These people do not leave you any room to invest in the interaction. This has a repellent effect.

At the same time, you‚Äôve also met people who gave you plenty of emotional space. 

Perhaps you have a friend who shows genuine interest whenever you talk to them and they always seem to want to hear more. 

This person makes you feel listened to and interesting. They allow you to invest in the interaction. This has a magnetic effect.

A great way to determine whether you are giving women enough emotional space is to pay attention to the ratio of talking to listening. Are you talking 80% of the time? Are you talking about half the time? Do you listen more than you talk?

If you find that you talk significantly more than the women (or people in general) you interact with, that‚Äôs a sign you may be taking up too much emotional space. 

Of course, don‚Äôt judge this by one interaction (some of the women you approach will be shy or reserved), look for the overarching pattern.

(Here's hidden camera footage of myself taking a girl home, it's a great example of leaving emotional space for a woman to invest: https://youtu.be/QnE1QJk0eJM)

In reality, seduction isn‚Äôt something you do to a girl, it‚Äôs more like a dance that gradually escalates in intensity. 
First, you spark her interest. Then you give her the chance to spark your interest. **You‚Äôre not picking the girl up, you are both picking each other up.** 

Yes, she wants to meet a man who is attractive and interesting, but she also wants a man that makes her feel like she is attractive and interesting.

Understand: giving women space to invest in you is a way you can offer value. Sure, you can offer value by being dominant, confident, and sexual. 

But you can also offer value by making a girl feel like she has positive qualities. The simplest way to do this is to listen intently to what she says while also asking further questions to understand her beliefs. Simply showing a girl that you‚Äôre interested in her opinions can be incredibly charming.

Another helpful tactic is to leave a pause after a girl finishes speaking. Oftentimes, you‚Äôll find that when you thought someone was done talking, they actually had more to say. Simply leaving space for the other person to keep talking will get them to invest more in the interaction.

Furthermore, leaving pauses creates a vacuum effect. When a conversation dies out for a moment, an uncomfortable tension builds. 

If you don‚Äôt fill in the conversational void, the woman will feel an urge to do so herself. This shifts the dynamic so that she‚Äôs the person who is contributing more effort into the conversation, and thus, she is investing.
In general, adopt the mindset that you are interested in who the girl is as a person and that you want to learn more about her. Women want to chase you, but they can only do so if you give them emotional space. 

&amp;nbsp;

##The Effort She Puts In To Win You OverÔªø

Ôªø&amp;nbsp;

Women are subconsciously aware of the following when interacting with a man:

- What does he want from me?

- What do I want from him?

On one level, she is aware of how much you want to have sex with her and how much she wants to have sex with you.

On another level, she‚Äôs aware of how much you want her attention and approval, and much she wants your attention and approval.

**The more a girl wants the above from you (attention, approval, sex) and the less she thinks you want those things from her, the more emotionally invested in you she will become.**

&amp;nbsp;

##How do you create this effect?

&amp;nbsp;

By not giving away everything you have to offer.

If you create a dynamic in which a girl feels that she needs to win you over, she will start chasing you.
Remember, when you‚Äôre interacting with a woman you find attractive, there should be an unmistakable sexual charge. But this is most powerful when she is uncertain whether the feeling of desire is mutual, or if she is alone in experiencing it. 

If a girl thinks that you might not be interested in her, she will start chasing your approval.
Women get hit on all the time, but they rarely meet a man who exudes sexual energy, while also making her wonder whether or not he is attracted to her. 

This mixture of hot and cold (nonverbally you are communicating desire, verbally you are communicating disinterest) is frustrating for a woman, it‚Äôs like an itch that she can‚Äôt scratch. 

This makes her try harder and harder to get your sexual approval, and the longer you withhold it, the more she wants it.

For instance, I was at a club recently and approached a girl by saying, ‚ÄúYou look like you should be a librarian.‚Äù (This line subtly implies that I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs physically attractive.)

However, while I was speaking, I looked at her dead in the eyes with an intent that was clearly sexual. She responded by saying, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the best pickup line I‚Äôve ever heard. You‚Äôre really charming.‚Äù

I replied, ‚ÄúMy mom tells me I‚Äôm charming too.‚Äù (Comparing her to my mom implies I‚Äôm not attracted to her).
Then, this girl attempted to touch my shoulder, but I backed away and said, ‚ÄúSorry, we need to leave three feet for the holy ghost.‚Äù

She replied, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre funny.‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúMy mom also tells me that.‚Äù

At this point, she leaned in and said, ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt bring your mom into this conversation. I want to fuck you later, and being compared to your mom is not exactly a turn-on.‚Äù (women will rarely say something this direct, but it does happen on occasion when you push the right buttons.)

When a girl shows interest in us, our default instinct is to reciprocate and to start chasing her. 

This makes it so that she cannot keep investing, and if anything, you can come across as needy (why do you get so excited when a girl shows you approval, is this something you‚Äôre not used to experiencing?)

**Do the opposite, let women wonder whether you‚Äôre attracted to them or not.**

When a girl who likes you can‚Äôt tell whether you‚Äôre interested, she will start chasing you by complimenting you, touching you, making strong eye contact with you, and in some cases even making an overt sexual remark. 

She knows she‚Äôs sexy, but she doesn‚Äôt understand why this charming guy doesn‚Äôt seem to see her that way.
Understand: the most exciting part of seduction is the chase. 

This is why pickup is almost exclusively taught to men. As a man, if you want to get laid, you have to approach women and take the lead - sex doesn‚Äôt get thrown at you wherever you go. 

Because of this, the thought of getting laid is exciting. 

Women, on the other hand, get sex constantly shoved in their faces. There‚Äôs no challenge in picking guys up, and therefore, there‚Äôs no thrill in it. 

Fortunately, **you can flip this dynamic on its head by being the one guy that doesn‚Äôt make himself completely sexually available**. Once you do this, the idea of sleeping with you becomes exciting, there‚Äôs now a reason to chase you.

This strategy is only effective once a girl has decided you have sexual value. If you walk up to a girl and immediately start implying that you‚Äôre not interested in her, it‚Äôs unlikely she will care: this isn‚Äôt about creating attraction so much as it is about increasing investment once attraction is already there.

**Attraction makes sex a possibility, emotional investment makes it practically inevitableÔªøÔªø.**

The most powerful way to show a girl that you may or may not be sexually interested in her isn‚Äôt through some technique or gimmick, it‚Äôs through having strong boundaries.

Partly, this means being willing to reject a girl based on what she says and does around  you (for instance, if a hot girl says shallow, obnoxious things, you should be willing to walk away because you don't want that kind of person in your life).

**But it also means you should react to a girl‚Äôs words and actions at face value rather than reacting to them based on how you feel about her.**

As an example, let‚Äôs say a girl you‚Äôre attracted to were to say, ‚ÄúBlack guys are so annoying, I really wish they‚Äôd stop hitting on me.‚Äù

If you were reacting to her based on your emotions towards her, you‚Äôd probably agree with her by saying something like, ‚ÄúThat must suck.‚Äù

Essentially, you are filtering yourself through the lens of, ‚ÄúWhat can I say to make this girl I‚Äôm attracted to approve of me?‚Äù

If, on the other hand, you were reacting to this girl‚Äôs words at face value, you would likely say something like, ‚ÄúThat sounds extremely racist. Why would you say that?‚Äù

The second statement would likely offend the girl, but paradoxically it would make her respect you more than the first statement - you‚Äôve just shown her that your approval isn‚Äôt given, it is earned (or unearned).

As another example, if a hot girl says she likes Pokemon, and your first thought is, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you were such a nerd,‚Äù say that.

When you‚Äôre attracted to someone, you may feel an urge to filter out anything that could come across as controversial or ‚Äòmean‚Äô. But **paradoxically, if you‚Äôre willing to express contentious opinions, girls will be more likely to chase you.**

If you are only saying what you think a girl wants to hear, you‚Äôre giving her the impression that you will approve of her no matter what she says. 

Instead, make your approval genuinely conditional. When a woman acts in a way that is not in alignment with your values, tell her so. (At the same time, if a woman does something you respect or admire, tell her so.)
Having boundaries means being willing to speak out when someone behaves in a way that opposes your values. Don‚Äôt be cruel or get emotional, simply offer an opposing opinion.

Having strong boundaries is difficult because it means potentially alienating people, and while this may happen, it will only truly alienate people who you weren‚Äôt compatible with in the first place.

Of course, boundaries can be too rigid. If you feel the need to tell someone they are ignorant because they have different religious beliefs than you, that‚Äôs less about boundaries and more about ego. 

It‚Äôs important that your boundaries are based on genuine values you hold like open-mindedness, self-determination, and positive energy.

For example, if a girl says something very close-minded, ‚ÄúBlack guys are annoying,‚Äù ‚ÄúRepublicans are selfish,‚Äù Democrats are idiotic,‚Äù I will assert a boundary by challenging that statement - without being cruel about it.

Similarly, if a girl says something negative, (I.E. she says she‚Äôs getting bad grades because she doesn‚Äôt have enough time to study), I will challenge her statement (I.E, there‚Äôs always time to study if you‚Äôre willing to sacrifice some of the time you spend on entertainment. I might say, ""Watch, let me see your phone."" I'll then go to her settings and show her how many hours she's wasting on her phone).

It can help to write down what you value in your interactions with people (men and women alike.) This might include the examples I gave above, but values are subjective, I cannot give you a list of values that you should have, they are based on your own beliefs and experiences.

Once you have a clear idea of what you value, you can write a list of things you will set boundaries for (I.E. negative energy, narcissism, overly simplistic thinking). 

Knowing what you want and don‚Äôt want in your social interactions will make it much easier to effectively set boundaries.

This will, in turn, allow you to show women that you are not yet another guy who approves of everything she does and says simply because she‚Äôs attractive, you are a guy who values his own beliefs more than the approval of some random girl. And if she wants your approval, she must earn it. Therefore, she will be incentivized to chase you, and by extension, to invest in you.

&amp;nbsp;

##Conclusion

&amp;nbsp;

Emotional investment is powerful, to say the least.

Most men operate from a flawed paradigm: they see attraction as something they must create by doing things that will impress a girl. Sadly, the harder you try to impress someone, the needier you will seem.

Adopt a different paradigm. Understand that women want a challenge, they want a guy who doesn‚Äôt make himself overly available.

The moment a girl seems to be enjoying your company, let her start investing in the interaction. 

Give her the opportunity to fill in any conversational gaps, allow her to do half (if not more) of the talking. Then, deepen her investment by making it clear that you have strong boundaries. Be willing to disagree with her, let her know that you‚Äôre willing to walk away. 

**Once you‚Äôve established this dynamic, she will no longer see herself as the prize that you‚Äôre trying to win, she will see you as the prize that she‚Äôs trying to win.**",70,1

"How to get laid if you are 16, from a dude who got laid at 16 (one year post)","This post was prompted by the other post of the dude who wrote about how he kissed a girl. Looking at the comments there's plenty of 16-19 yr olds who still struggle to talk to girls. I was there too at one point, and yes, TRP does work. Have faith. Here's my story.

*BACKGROUND*

I turn 17 today, and just got off the call with the boys and finished answering all my dms. It's 3 in the morning so pardon any grammar errors, and I'm reflecting on the past year. It's been crazy (atleast by the standards of a 17 year old). I found TRP almost exactly a year ago, and have since progressed so much I'm no longer the same person anymore I was a year ago.

To give a glimpse, before TRP I had exactly 4 friends, literally invisible people. Think of the loser/nerd group in your school. We were worse than that. To properly put it in perspective, here's an example. Our school has uniforms, but we can wear casual clothes on our birthdays. On my 15th birthday, one of the hot girls literally told me ""hey you, I've never seen you here. Happy birthday btw."" I've been in that school for 7 years, in the same grade as her.

Personally, I was awkward, shy, a loner, loser who would literally freeze up talking to girls. I think you get the idea.

*TRP JOURNEY*

Over the past year, I've changed beyond recognition. At the start of the school year, I saw a cute girl in my class with her friends and literally thought ""god I will never be in their group"" with a crushing feeling of defeat. A few months later I went on multiple dates with that same chick. A year ago, one of the dumb thots called me ""awkward and weird"" and proceeded to laugh in my face. Today, she made a birthday video for me along with a bunch of other dumb thots. From thinking, ""I will be a wizard kisshugvirgin"" to having sex, clapping cheeks and getting my cock sucked, multiple times.

I think these examples show my progress better than anything else I can say. The more I self improve, the less I come to TRP. And yet I'm making this post today, because if it wasn't for TRP I would still be that awkward loner loser, and hope to save some high schoolers from the same fate.

For the first 2 months or so, I read the SIDEBAR. Seriously, read the fucking SIDEBAR. It literally contains a step by step guide to social interaction. Literally all you need is the SIDEBAR, but I know you won't understand that and will continue consuming content. I did too at the time.

After that, I went and experimented. Just as important as the sidebar. We're young, and we have time. Go out and try what you read. It will be scary and you will make mistakes and cringe at yourself, but that's okay. Mid TRP me was very fucking cringe. Social interaction to me was like studying college level maths when I hadn't even passed 5th grade. I had no idea what the fuck I was doing, and got some very cringeworthy moments to laugh at now.

*Social media*

soial media is the easiest way to get laid, by far. Instagram profile is a must imo, especially if you're under 20. Buy followers if you need to, but keep a good follower/following ratio and have a good amount of followers too. It's literal preselection. Post cool stories, don't post too much on the main feed. I have literally 0 posts and 1000 followers. Girls slide in my dms like crazy.

Don't use Twitter, minimise Reddit, leave all the random discord servers. Snapchat is optional, I only have streaks with a few close friends and a couple hot girls there. Tiktok is an utter waste of time, but if you're high enough SMV to post, by all means go for it. 

*CONCLUSION*

This post originally started out as a tips for guys post, but it turned into a hybrid of tips, a thank you and my journey. I think I've said whatever I can, literally everything else has already been written. A huge thank you to this community, all the contributors who've spent countless hours on invaluable content. I escaped the black hole I was in a year ago, and hope other dudes can do it too.

Also remember, pussy isn't everything.",16,1

Help each other out boiz,"Been on the pill for almost 3 years now and I'm sure just like any of you after such long period you start experimenting with all sorts of stuff. My recent experiment involved befriending girls who are already in a relationship. 

I just want to make a disclaimer before we proceed with this post. I'm gaming girls outside of my social circles and I am, although not weekly, getting laid. I'm not spinning plates but I'm getting laid with a girl or another every once in a while. The married and in relationship girls I'm talking about in the following lines are girls I'M NOT TRYING TO FUCK AND HAVE NO INTENTION OF DOING SO. 

I repeat. 

I HAVE NO INTENTION OF FUCKING THESE GIRLS. I just want to have them as friends. 

TRP preaches against having female friends because men are usually in it for the pussy and end up in the friendzone and they think that if they stay there long enough they can get pussy after a while. We all know that's not how it works and that's exactly what I'm NOT doing. 

I met these girls in social settings through mutual friends and I learnt they have boyfriends and husbands and never tried to pull any move and I actually enjoy their company. And not only that, but they helped me with so many things, money, a place to stay outside of my city, drugs, free professional services (design and photography) lifts and so on. 

The girls I'm on very good terms with. We talk bullishit all the time we connect as friends and nothing sexual occurs all under the supervision of the boyfriend/husband. One thing I've been doing though is to befriend the boyfriend. 

Guys I'm telling you. If you get along with their girls, guys will respect you and they'll do you favours even greater than the girls. I'm just sharing this because just recently I got kicked out of my accomodation and was facing homelessness. But one of the guys took me under his wing and now I'm living in his place with his wife who's also my friend. Very temporarily though. I found an apartment and I'm moving in in 3 days so all's good. 

But during my stay, we talked a lot about everything, and I keep complimenting the guy in front of her and I can see it having an immediate effect. 

In social settings when I do this, girls usually start lightly touching their partners and get all excited about being with them again after I drop a compliment. It could be his style, his job, hobbies, accomplishments, anything really. And I'm sure it helps with the relationship dynamics after that. 

When guys figure out you're not there to fuck their girls (like a lot of douchebags out there I encountered when I was in a relationship) and instead wiling to have a genuine conversation, they'll let their guards down and befriend you and in some cases start completing back. 

I just wish we did this a bit more. I think it.helps to raise each other's SMV. 

P.S. Don't give me the ""you're orbiting these girls"" trust me I'm not. Not trying to fuck them I just want to have friends. Males females or shemales I really can't be bothered.",27,1

The Red Pill works,"This was my 2nd date ever, just for your Information.

It started when she texted me something. I replied and made sure to give short texted anwsers. Anyways we talked for a bit and then I planned the date.

Told her to come to this place at this time.
Well today we met. 

We went for a walk around the blocks and then finally settled down at a bank. I already edited her a lot and did things like Kino and just made sure I always was on the same level of conversation as her, but never too invested.

Well she took my arm and then I said let us go. 
Later we went into the Forrest and sat there for awhile before I did the same trick I did last time,
tease her by clicking with my watch.

She then leaned on me and I touched her leg and stuff you know the deal and then I went in for the kiss myself. This was very important, as I am very sure that she wouldn‚Äòt have had progressed past that line with touching.
After that she had to go.

Already told myself after that I can not be emotionally attached so that is out. Learned my lesson there last time.
 
Please keep in mind that this was just my 2nd date ever (not with her but with girls in general by the way). And that I am only 16 yet.

I also doubted the Red Pill at first but this experience has showed me that this really does work.",103,1

Women are not like a equation.,"Hello gents, 

the number one reason I see lads getting friendzoned today is because they rely on covert contracts.
I think that this is well known but it needs to be adressed so much more because people do not get the background and importance of it.

Nice guy will come to the date and treat the woman like an equation. The mind flow will be, ""If I do A, B and C I will surely get the D"". D usually stands for physicall escalation. So what are A,B and C then? It can be anything. Literally. A can be buying her flowers, B can be  taking her coat and C can be paying for drinks. It can also be G, E and F and so on and so on. It does not matter. 

Why?

Because you expect. You take away the focus from you having fun and being a guy with options to the chap operating in her frame. Women can smell that shit miles away because they communicate covertly. State your intentions and do not rely on cheap tricks.

Let her do A, B, Cs for you so she can get the D. Which is of couse the Dick in this case. Erase the convetions you were forced into since you were a child telling you that you should do all these nice things so woman will like you.

And always, always, be ready to walk away.",57,1

Lifting Basics - Strength Trainning - Guide for Dummies,"&gt; ""It is a disgrace to grow old through sheer carelessness before seeing what manner of man you may become by developing your bodily strength and beauty to their highest limit."" - Socrates 

This guide is for absolute beginners and people who have been lifting without following a proper program. People who do not exercise at all have the most benefits to reap from this.

Due to how fast-paced everything is and how people's attention spans are low, I try to present the information here in the simplest way possible.

The source for this guide is [Stronglifts 5x5](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/).

&amp;#x200B;

# Why you should do it

* **Potential**. Read quote above. A man is built. A man is remembered by his deeds. You don't want to be another 40 year old weakling (assuming you're younger), with a beer belly that can barely walk 3 storeys upstairs. You also don't want to be another 20-something year old, a male at age of high-performance, that can barely do a pullup.
* **Health benefits**. Assuming you don't do any other exercise: you're missing huge **health gains**. Exercise = longevity. It also means increased energy, focus and improved mood. This is pretty common knoweldge and the science evidence is massive. If you can't even get your ass up to do something that is proven to make you live longer, which is a basic instinct, you have a serious problem. Exercising is **non-negotiable** if you are to take yourself seriously.
* **Strength.** It is a reason in itself. Strength is at the core of what **masculinity** is. Not only physical strength, but that's beyond this post. It hurts, it takes time, discipline. And that is why it is beautiful. You may feel like not going to the gym despite making awesome progress. You may feel like giving up when you fail to lift. It takes effort. It separates the low-performance from high-performance people.

&amp;#x200B;

# Core principles &amp; Exercises

* **Intensity**. As a beginner, strength trainning provides the most rewards for you to reap. ST = intensity = big (relative) weight. For the purposes of this guide, if you can lift a weight 8+ times for multiple sets, you're **warming up**.
* **Effort**. Goes hand-in-hand with intensity. Going to the gym to curl 8kg (17lb) dumbbells is a very inefficient use of time. You must give your best. **It shouyldn't be easy**. Not too hard, but definitely not easy. You should sweat. You should breathe deeply from heavy effort. More details on '**How to begin**' below.
* **Full-body**. Forget about working out 'areas' of your body. Forget about getting big biceps / pecs / whatever. Your main priorities as beginner are to **build strenght and technique**. You need to strengthen your whole body. That is why you'll only do compound lifts, that is, lifts that work out multiple muscles. Also because more muscles involved = more weight lifted.
* **Progressive overload**. This is the core of trainning. You'll be increasing the weight on your lifts with time. At first, very quickly. However it is only natural that gains come slower with time, see the [diminishing returns principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns). 
* **Simplicity**. 5 exercises. 2 workouts. 3 different compound lifts per workout. 

**What you'll be doing:**

1. **Squat**. Probably the most important lift here. Squat is the closest main lift to the walking movement pattern. Heavily trains your **quads**, which make up the majority of your thighs. Walking upstairs becomes unremarkable after your quads get used to lifting your body + your body weight in iron. It also heavily stimulates you **core** muscles, whose importance is way bigger than you imagine. [How to squat (lower bar)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhoikoUEI8U) or [How to squat (upper bar)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy28eq2PjcM) Lower = more back use, upper = more quad use. 
2. **Deadlift**. Similar to squat. Provides tremendous stimulus for your core. **Core = abs + spinal erectors + glutes**. Deadlift is the exercise in which you can naturally lift the **most weight**. For this reason, **technique** is extremely important. There is no shortage of footage showing people curving their entire backs while DLing. This is poor technique and **poor technique will hurt you**. Doing it correctly, DL will provide great core gains and **motivation**. You'll lift weights you never thought you'd. [How to deadlift?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19ZeTrLZdyQ)
3. **Overhead Press**. Personal favorite. **Weakest** move pattern (vertical push) of all here. OHP works your triceps and delts, very useful muscles but relatively weak ones. For me OHP technique is the **trickiest** to nail down. Yet, I'd say it feels like the most **masculine** of the lifts. Lifting heavy stuff above head level is no easy task. Make sure to read source material and watch tutorial videos. [How to overhead press?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJlKUo2-P4o) and [How to overhead press (Starting Strength)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dacy5hjaE8).
4. **Bench Press**. Strongest lift when it comes to upper body. BP works mostly your pecs, which are very important, but also triceps and delts to a minor extent. BP is **not as straightforward** as it looks. Again, read the source and watch the videos. BP requires **correct shoulder position, wrist angle, spine curve and leg positioning**. Most people just lay on the bench and push the barbell up. They lift less than they could with proper technique, with less safety, and only until their shoulders give in. This is not a problem with proper technique. [How to bench press?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxD321l2svE&amp;t=8s)
5. **Barbell / Pendlay Row.** Rows will work mainly your middle/upper back muscles and biceps. And thus we have a full-body workout program. Most important thing about the row is to make sure you're **lifting from a dead stop,** like DL. Don't pick the bar, bend your torso down and bounce the bar in the air. Bend your torso all the way until the weights hit the ground / a small platform if needed. Keep your knees as straight as possible and back straight, bring the bar to your belly. It's easy to mess it up. [How to barbell row?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQU8wZPbioA)

&amp;#x200B;

# How to begin

**Start with weights lower than your actual capability** in order to nail down technique and get your body used to making effort. Follow the tutorials. Start with either empty barbell, lightly-loaded barbell for DL or dumbbells in case you can't lift the barbell. You'll be **sore** the first times, it's completely normal.  Your body is getting used to stimuli it didn't have. 

Your objective is to **increase the weight you lift**. During this time, you **may be increasing your weights every single workout session.** 2.5kg max increase (5lbs). Lower increase is not a problem. Bigger jumps, except for deadlift, are not good. For DL you can increase up to 5kg (11lbs) per workout.

Watch the videos listed above and search more by yourself. Read [Stronglifts 5x5](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/) for more details or [Starting Strength](https://startingstrength.com/about), wich is similar.

&amp;#x200B;

**What you won't be doing:** Don't use machines. Don't lift weak-ass pinky dumbbells. You equipment is the **barbell** and a barbell rack for squat/OHP or bench for BP. Load it with as much weight as you can lift for 5 reps, 5 sets (1 set in DL case) and **good painless technique**.

&amp;#x200B;

# Rest &amp; Nutrition

These are **essential parts** of your workout lifestyle, and **just as important** as lifting, if not more. I won't get in as much detail as I did for the lifting, you can research more by yourself.

Lifting is the **stimulus** for the body to adapt. Your body **can't adapt** without proper nutrients and recovery. 

For nutrition, your first objective, in case you're like I was and ate too little, to **eat enough / eat big**. Not all the nutrients you put in your stomach get to your blood. From these, **a small portion** will be used to build muscle. This it is of utmost importance you have enough proteins, fats and carbs flowing through your blood. After that, you should **eat healthy**. 

Eating big but eating like shit will destroy you in the long run. **It is not sustainable**. The whole point of this is to build a healthy lifestyle. Also, eating healthy will provide you nutrients of greater quality (vitamins, fibers, better fats and carbs), thus improving your health. **More health = more energy = bigger lifts**.

Recovery is self-explanatory. Your body needs time to work throught the tissue damage caused by lifting. Insufficient rest also means less energy and focus. **Less energy = more failures = smaller lifts.**

**Anything that impacts your health also impacts your lifts. Better health = bigger lifts. More lifts = better health.** 

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

Lift heavy, lift smart. Get enough nutrients and recovery. For more details on the trainning philosophy and why it works, see [Stronglifts 5x5](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/). You also get a **detailed description + video** for each exercise in that guide.

Make sure to always keep your technique on point. Everyone develops bad habits.

Be a better version of yourself.",54,1

Dating Apps All Time High Fish Catcher,"With Covid And Social Distancing the best way to meet women fast is through dating apps. 
Covid per some doctors and outlets will stick around for another 2 years. 
Living in the present, best way to pick up women is not in social places but online. And once at your place, a big barrier will automatically come down and go for the touchdown. 

Don‚Äôt be surprised if you can get her and a surplus to come over to your place on the first date due to Covid (curfews, no inside dining, personal health concerns). 

NOT HERE TO PROMOTE DATING APPS.
What will make your profile stand out in these apps. 

1. Profile Picture - #1! Bro‚Äôs you have to have a good profile pic. (Clear pic, able to see you) Post atleast 3-4 more pics. (One mirror pic at most, others socializing, gym, vacations, fun) 

2. About me - fill in your about me. Not to lengthy not to short. Fishes do read to see what you put in place. Keep it fun, short and simple. 

3. Social Media - if you have Instagram; most of these dating apps will ask to connect your instagram. This will help with the fishes knowing your not a psycho and will appear legit. (We all remember the Craigslist killer) 

4. Upgrade - upgrade to a membership, and upgrade to boost your profile during peak hours (5pm when people are out of work and driving, rainy weather, etc) 
What is boost? Boost will be a feature that you pay for that will put your profile at the top of searches for usually 30 minutes (depends on the app).
Paying for a membership will give you perks in letting you see who has liked your profile, unlimited swipes, etc. and instead of swiping your fingers off you can automatically go  and like the other profiles that have liked your profile and start your conversation. 

5. Do the work - don‚Äôt get impatient. The more swipes the more fishes will match with you. A lot of these fishes don‚Äôt log in everyday so if they don‚Äôt match during that day give it time. 

**BEWARES** 
No Simping on those apps. Fishes will ask for money. 
Fishes will ask you to follow them on Instagram. No instagram clout.

How To Be An Attractive Man: 4 Key Tips,"###After hours of research, I had found what I thought to be the perfect pickup line. I walked up to a beautiful girl and said, ‚ÄúHey, I thought you were cute, and I had to say hi.‚Äù 

###She smiled, said thank you, and we talked for a couple minutes until she paused and said, ‚ÄúIt was nice to meet you,‚Äù and walked away. I never saw her again.

I‚Äôve read dozens of books teaching men how to attract women with lines, tactics, and tricks. But after 10 years in the game, thousands of approaches, and yes, a good number of ‚Äúlays‚Äù ‚Äì I‚Äôve found that attracting women isn‚Äôt something you can force. In fact, the harder you try to get a woman to like you, the less attractive you will be to her.

When that girl from the above example rejected me, I could have blamed it on the line I used. But truthfully, no matter what I said, the result would have been the same. This is because attraction isn‚Äôt something you do, it‚Äôs something you are.

Of all the times I attracted a woman, not once did I attract her because of some technique I used. Every single time, I attracted her because of who I was.

There‚Äôs a saying, ‚ÄúThe self is always shining through.‚Äù Basically, no matter how hard you try to ‚Äúmake a girl like you‚Äù using some tactic, it won‚Äôt work because using a technique to attract a woman is in itself a form of overcompensation.

We only use techniques because on some level we don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre good enough by default, so we try to make up for our inadequacy with a line or a trick(1).

I can‚Äôt teach you how attract a specific girl using techniques, but I CAN teach you how to be an attractive man who naturally draws women in.

There‚Äôs no quick-fix. Becoming the most attractive version of yourself requires that you invest both time and effort in yourself. But the end result is easily worth it. Over-time - by following the 4 tips in this article - you will become exponentially more appealing to the opposite sex.

&amp;nbsp;

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 1:
##Develop your Self-Confidence

&amp;nbsp;

It‚Äôs no secret that self-confidence is attractive, but what is it, really?

If asked, most people would say, ‚ÄúSelf-confidence is belief in yourself.‚Äù And that‚Äôs true, but there‚Äôs a key component missing in that definition.

Self-confidence isn‚Äôt just belief in yourself, it‚Äôs the belief that everything will turn out okay when you attempt something.

Self-confidence doesn‚Äôt mean you expect every girl to like you, it simply means that you‚Äôre okay with the consequences of taking a risk, even if the girl doesn‚Äôt like you.

When we lack self-confidence with women, we think that rejection is the worst thing that could happen to us. That fear causes us to filter ourselves in conversation, to adopt defensive body language, and even to speak with a weaker vocal tonality.

Our inner lack of confidence causes us to behave less attractively. The more confident you become, the more attractive you will be - because you‚Äôll stop getting in your own way.

How do you actually do that? Well, how do we become confident in anything? Take driving for example. We become confident drivers by giving our brains proof that when we take the wheel, disaster will not ensue.

Every time we drive - and we live to tell the tale - we become a little more confident in ourselves as a driver. The same applies to dating. Every time you take a social risk, and come out the other side unharmed, you will become a little bit more confident.

For example, the more women you approach, the lower the stakes will feel when you walk up to a girl, because you‚Äôll become comfortable with the possibility of getting rejected.

What this means will vary from person to person. For many guys just starting their journey, the first step to developing self-confidence will just be getting out of the house, for others it will be something bolder.

As you develop your self-confidence, you will become more attractive to women. Fortunately, if you utilize tip 4, the process of confidence building will largely take place automatically.

The most important take-aways from this are that you can‚Äôt fake confidence, and that it will take time to develop ‚Äì BUT your level of confidence is completely under your control and improving it will make you more attractive.

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 2:
##Develop Standards

&amp;nbsp;

The more women you‚Äôre willing to reject, the more attractive to women you will become. This is counter-intuitive, but it‚Äôs true.

If there is one thing that turns women off more than anything, it‚Äôs neediness. A guy acts needy when he is so desperate to be with a girl that no matter what she does or says, he would still sleep with her.

Neediness is suffocating. It shows that you take getting with a girl way too seriously and that you see yourself as incapable of getting another girl of her caliber if you wanted to.

Most of the guys I‚Äôve met who have trouble attracting women (and there are many) have a problem with neediness. They see girls as a means to an end. They will happily sleep with any girl because that makes them feel like they ‚Äúwon‚Äù.

Men with this mindset don‚Äôt meet women to connect with another human being, but to get a sense of accomplishment from sleeping with a girl.

These guys don‚Äôt have standards for themselves. They see a hot girl as a prize to be won, so they are desperate to get her. Her personality is irrelevant. Her values are irrelevant.

When you see women as mere sex-objects, it‚Äôs impossible to have a real human interaction with them. And, naturally, a man who sees a woman as a human being is much more likely to attract her than a man who sees her as the fleshy equivalent of a gold coin.

The best way to eliminate this neediness that derives from seeing attractive women as prizes is to develop standards. Instead of being the guy who will do anything to get with the hot girl, you want to be the guy who‚Äôs interested in the hot girl but hasn‚Äôt decided if he wants to sleep with her yet.

Just like confidence, this can‚Äôt be faked. Pretending that you have standards by disqualifying a girl or negging her won‚Äôt make her see you as a high-status guy. You have to develop actual standards.

A good place to start is to make a clear list of what you won‚Äôt accept in a woman you‚Äôre considering dating (in whatever capacity). For reference, here‚Äôs a few of the things I won‚Äôt accept in a woman:

-If a girl has any kind of drug addiction, I‚Äôm out.

-If she‚Äôs unhealthily narcissistic, I‚Äôm out

-If she has a negative mindset, I‚Äôm out.

-If she is uninteresting, I‚Äôm out.

When I‚Äôm interacting with a woman, I‚Äôm screening her for the above traits. She might be a perfect ten in appearance, but if she‚Äôs narcissistic and uninteresting, I‚Äôm not going to sleep with her. To do so would be selling myself short.

The only reason I would sleep with that girl is because it would give me a sense of ego-gratification. I‚Äôd be doing it, so I could tell my friends about, not because to do so would actually be enjoyable.

In my experience, at least, sex is better when you actually like the person. Physical attraction is important, too, sure. But I‚Äôve been with extremely beautiful women in the past who I didn‚Äôt have any chemistry with - and it was crappy.

Writing a list of the things you won‚Äôt tolerate in a potential sexual partner and rejecting women who don‚Äôt meet those standards is a powerful strategy for becoming more attractive to women. (Btw, it‚Äôs also useful to write a list of the things you do want in a partner.)

When you‚Äôre interacting with a beautiful woman and you‚Äôre willing to reject her depending on what she does and says, the entire dynamic changes. Instead of acting like a guy who would do anything to get laid, you will act like a guy who has an abundance of options.

Your non-neediness will make you infinitely more attractive than all the desperate guys pining after her. But this starts with taking a moment to write out what you want (and don‚Äôt want) in a girl you‚Äôre considering having a sexual relationship with.

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 3:
##Improve your Appearance

&amp;nbsp;

Looks matter. The better looking you are, the higher percentage of women will make it easy for you to pick them up. At the same time, no matter how unattractive you are, some percentage of women will be attracted to you if are confident, non-needy, etc. (and that percentage is probably higher than you think).

There are two important misconceptions about looks that must be cleared up:

-Waiting to get in shape before meeting women is a silly idea.
-Your looks matter, but they don‚Äôt exist in a vacuum.

A lot of guys realize that looks matter, so they decide that once they‚Äôve got their looks ‚Äúhandled‚Äù they‚Äôll start approaching women. This is problematic because it can easily turn into a form of procrastination. Your appearance is something that you can constantly improve, but you‚Äôll never reach a particular point where you‚Äôve ‚Äúmade it‚Äù. Furthermore, improving your looks won‚Äôt make game easy. I‚Äôve seen numerous good-looking guys fail at game. These guys expect their looks to do all the work for them, but truth is you still have to be very confident and assertive to succeed with women.

The vast majority of guys don‚Äôt have the confidence necessary to take a woman home, and that‚Äôs something you can only develop through practice. Thinking you look good helps, but it‚Äôs not magically going to make you comfortable with social risk taking ‚Äì(if only it were that simple).

Improve your appearance while also improving your social skills. It‚Äôs not one or the other, it‚Äôs both. Focusing on your looks while neglecting to actually interact with women is a recipe for failure.

Social skills, confidence, and physical attractiveness are all important when it comes to dating, don‚Äôt sell yourself short by improving one and neglecting the others. To do so would be as silly as learning how to shoot in basketball, but not how to dribble or pass.

That said, you can make a staggering improvement in your appearance in the course of a single day. Get a high-end salon haircut. Buy some clothes that fit well and don‚Äôt make you look like you live in your mother‚Äôs basement. Simply dressing better and having a sense of style will make you more substantially more attractive. It‚Äôs not going to make up for a lack of confidence and experience, but it‚Äôs a good start. And really, 95% of guys in the seduction community have plenty of room to improve their style.

I‚Äôm no expert on fashion, but here are a couple resources you can look at to get started with:

http://masculine-style.com/rugged-refined-and-rakish/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiAubtXLnFs

Obviously, when it comes to improving your looks, style is only half the battle. There‚Äôs no reason not to be in good shape. If you‚Äôre not already working out regularly, the easiest way to start is to go to the gym with a friend of yours who‚Äôs already in good shape.

Having a gym buddy will help keep you accountable to working out even when you don‚Äôt feel motivated. Plus, if your friend is in good shape, they‚Äôll be able to help provide you with guidance.

If you don‚Äôt have a friend who can help you, there‚Äôs an unlimited number of fitness guides you can download. Find someone you resonate with and trust and follow their plan. If you have trouble being consistent, get a trainer to hold you accountable and provide guidance.

&amp;nbsp;

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 4:
##Treat Dating Like A Skill

&amp;nbsp;

Whatever you want to accomplish in life, there are certain elements that are outside of your control. - If you want to be a doctor, a low IQ is a disadvantage that‚Äôs outside your control. - If you want to get rich, having a poor family is disadvantage that‚Äôs outside your control. - If you want to date beautiful women, factors like your height, race, etc. can be disadvantages that are outside your control.

Dating coaches who say factors like your race and height don‚Äôt matter are lying. Sure, they matter, but they‚Äôre out of your control: worrying about them is only going to hurt you.

When you tell yourself, ‚ÄúGirls don‚Äôt like Asians,‚Äù you‚Äôre going to see your interactions with women through that lens. If you walk up to a girl, and she rejects you, you‚Äôre going to say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because I‚Äôm Asian. If I were white that wouldn‚Äôt have happened.‚Äù

This narrative becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you‚Äôre interacting with a woman, and you expect her not to like you, you‚Äôll act different than if you expect her to like you. Your insecurities will show up in your behavior, and when she rejects you, you‚Äôll think, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because I‚Äôm Asian.‚Äù Then you‚Äôll become even more insecure, women will like you even less, and so on.

You can‚Äôt change your race, but you can change many of the other factors that create sexual attraction. The guy who wants to get rich but has a poor family can work twice as hard as his competition, and within a few years he can get to a point where he‚Äôs making a six-figure income.

Similarly, a short Asian guy with a below average face can succeed with women IF he works twice as hard as his competition and focuses on the factors that are under his control. His level of self-confidence is under his control, his style and fitness are under his control, and his ability to take social risks is under his control.

Look, with the above example, I said that the guy with a poor family could make six-figures, I didn‚Äôt say he can become a billionaire. Being a billionaire probably requires a certain amount of luck, the right family, being born in right time and place, the right genetics, etc.

But anyone can make six-figures with enough time and effort. The same is true in dating. If you‚Äôre naturally a four on a looks scale, I can‚Äôt promise that you‚Äôll be able to date Victoria‚Äôs Secret models, but you can still bat way out of your league and hook up with attractive girls.

By treating dating as a skillset, you can date higher quality women than you would otherwise. If you fixate on whether you can get ‚Äúperfect tens‚Äù you‚Äôre just going to cause yourself frustration.

We have these fantasies, whether it‚Äôs to be a billionaire or to sleep with ‚Äú10s‚Äù. These fantasies stifle us because they‚Äôre so far outside of our reality. Worry about pulling ‚Äú10s‚Äù when you can already pull ‚Äú9s‚Äù easily. Treat dating like a skillset by taking it one step at a time. Don‚Äôt spend much time learning how to build attraction when you still have crippling approach anxiety.

-I know a guy who‚Äôs great at getting women attracted to him, but he always chokes by leaving the interaction before anything sexual can happen. He would massively improve his results if he focused on leading interactions forward by inviting the girl to the dance floor, to another area, etc.

-I know another guy who is great at opening girls, but he‚Äôs so quiet they don‚Äôt pay attention to him. He would gain so much by working on his volume.

 -I know a third guy who is great at dating girls who aren‚Äôt particularly attractive. But he won‚Äôt even approach girls who he thinks are pretty. He‚Äôs unnecessarily limiting himself to only date women that are far worse looking than he is!

I could give countless examples like the above. No, these guys can‚Äôt change their race, but they can learn to lead interactions forward, to speak louder, or to approach more attractive women.

In dating, there countless factors that are under your control. Worrying about the things outside your control is silly when there are so many things you can proactively improve on.

Don‚Äôt think about your race, think about your confidence. Don‚Äôt think about your height, think about your inability to approach attractive women.

Treat dating as a skill, and you can improve your results dramatically. Treat it like something entirely based on your genetics, and you‚Äôll just drown yourself in self-pity.

&amp;nbsp;

###Skill Only Comes with Practice

&amp;nbsp;

The other key to treating dating like a skill, is to practice. If you spent 5 hours a week reading about how to pass a basketball, but never went out and played the game, people would think you‚Äôre an idiot.

Yet it‚Äôs common for guys to spend dozens- if not hundreds - of hours learning about how to attract women, without going out into the world and practicing. Intellectual learning is only useful if you‚Äôre spending most of your time in the real world getting real feedback.

Imagining what a good basketball shot looks like is completely different from taking the actual shot. Similarly, imagining what a good approach looks like is completely different from doing the approach. Information is only helpful to provide some guidance, it can‚Äôt do the work for you. Only real practice can.

It‚Äôs a lot easier to read about picking up women than it is to actually do it. I know this as well as anyone. When I first learned about the seduction community, I spent over a year wat

ching videos without doing a single approach. 

Was it helpful? 

No. 

If anything, my social skills got worse because I became so overanalytical. Learning how to attract women without practicing is just as absurd as trying to learn any other skill without practicing.

Treating dating like a skillset is difficult. It takes patience, time, and effort to do so. Here are some resources that can help you if you get stuck:

##Conclusion: How To Be An Attractive Man

&amp;nbsp;

There you have it, how to be an attractive man. Any of the four tips can change your life individually, but master all four and you won‚Äôt believe the successes you‚Äôll have.

Reading is how to do this is the easy part, becoming more attractive to women is a long-term process. Remember, anyone who tells you it‚Äôs going to be easy - that you can use some ‚Äúhack‚Äù to succeed with women ‚Äì is more interested in making money than in helping you improve.

Changing your life is hard, but what‚Äôs the alternative? Approaching women can be painful, but not nearly as painful as it would be to settle for a woman you‚Äôre not happy with because ‚Äúshe was the best you could get‚Äù (which is what the majority of men end up doing).

Fortunately, most of the factors that make a man attractive to women are under your control. If you‚Äôre willing to treat dating like a skill, you can master it.",110,1

"To all my teenage RPers, taking care of your hygiene and environment should be your number 1 priority.","Seriously, a lot of you can increase your SMV just by taking good care of your skin, putting on a good smelling lotion and deodorant, and making sure you aren't CRUSTY. Many teenagers overlook this because they think it is ""gay"" to take care of yourself, this idea is so fucking ridiculous. Not only are you promoting being a disgusting fuck, but this also just shows how fragile your masculinity really is. You fear being called gay and being judged just because you want to better your appearance, because you know, taking care of your skin is ""girly""; right? WRONG, that shit just shows how much you care about yourself. 

It is very satisfying to look at someone who is aesthetically pleasing, this doesn't necessarily mean they are jacked, but that they have a haircut, clear skin, smell good, and just overall look that they give 2 fucks about their appearance. I don't see this being pushed enough in our youth, and I really think this needs more awareness. Just being clean and tidy in general is very sexy, having a clean and good smelling room goes a long way too. 

Trust me, when a bitch comes over to your room, you do NOT want your room to be smelling like some dirty ass laundry. Get a candle, or a wax melter, jus something that will elevate the total comfort and feel of your room. I know that cleaning your room and shit is a hassle and it's fucking boring, but it really reflects your personality and how you really are. If all you do is sit on that damn chair playing Warzone, letting your clothes pile up in the corner, while you have monster cans on the floor; then I hate to break it to you, but you aren't going to have sex with JESSICA. Clean up where you stay dawg, don't be a dirty fuck.

I'll break down the products I use and the things I do to keep my room clean and comfy:

* Hair- Head and Shoulders is hands down the best shampoo out there if you have dandruff or dry hair. Use that, you don't need anything special. About $10 at costco. Not too expensive.
* Body Wash- [This shit does WONDERS.](https://www.renpure.com/products/body/base-brand-coconut-milk-vitamin-e-body-wash/) This shit is like $5. Renpure is hands down the best body wash brand I have used thus far. This shit will make your skin as smooth as butter and it will GLOW. It also helps with acne if you scrub your face with it. 
* Penis- CLEAN YOUR DAMN FORESKIN. For the love of GOD please pull your dick back and clean your dick cheese. Scrub that shit with some warm water and the body wash. Make sure it is all gone, do not overlook any white spots, make it crystal clear. Trim your pubes too. 
* Lotion- For my body I use [Renpure Lavender and Honey](https://www.renpure.com/products/body/lavender-honey-body-lotion/) Either that or [Dr. Teals coconut lotion](https://www.target.com/p/dr-teal-39-s-nourishing-coconut-oil-body-lotion-18-fl-oz/-/A-53248669). For my face I use [Vaseline cooling lotion.](https://www.vaseline.com/us/en/products/lotions-and-moisturizers/vaseline-men-healing-moisture-cooling-lotion.html) 
* Deodorant- Just use any old spice deodorant and make sure it says deodorant in the label, not anti-perspirant because that shit will stain your armpits for white clothes. I also use [Lacoste white deodorant](https://www.fragrancenet.com/cologne/lacoste/lacoste-eau-de-lacoste-l.12.12-blanc/deodorant?gclid=Cj0KCQjws536BRDTARIsANeUZ5_AFb3odfIBeDIZf87tXwNpxk_04gacVE4rdc0dOf_IKvxOoecBoJQaAp1EEALw_wcB&amp;mv_pc=gawus_pla_c_g_1975102296_286011&amp;utm_campaign=g&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google_us#286011). If you wanna get real fancy, then get the lacoste. Shit smells like heaven. 
* Cologne- You don't want to be cheap about your cologne, good cologne is expensive. I use [YSL L'HOMME](https://www.ulta.com/lhomme-eau-de-toilette?productId=VP12563&amp;sku=2150713&amp;cmpid=PS_Non!google!Product_Listing_Ads&amp;cagpspn=pla&amp;CATCI=aud-846350983874:pla-549729857755&amp;CAAGID=62257007938&amp;CAWELAID=772015985&amp;CATARGETID=330000200001600671&amp;cadevice=c&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjws536BRDTARIsANeUZ5_bPNyoPp06O3rR9vwj_S8_w-gEg-OswI-3vIgxsjvEJa-5KR7YtK4aAkHKEALw_wcB), this one right here is fresh and very vibrant. So it is good for daily use. But then again, the Versace [Blue](https://www.sephora.com/product/versace-man-eau-fraiche-P169301?country_switch=us&amp;lang=en&amp;skuId=972646&amp;om_mmc=ppc-GG_1918213323_68906954365_pla-420631061676_972646_353513010229_9032295_c&amp;ds_rl=1261471&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjws536BRDTARIsANeUZ588SE1BQE0zIQ2AJ5GtbQHx35EZbbYKoQzL1EXosFeFto1bPRlzHbMaAmJzEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) is amazing as well. Apply on your neck, wrists, elbow crease, and your chest area.  
* Nails- Keep them bitches trimmed at all times, make sure you file them and polish them. Not nail polish, but get a filer that also has a polishing side.
* Hair/Beard- This is up to you, if you want to grow it out, then grow it out, but make sure it looks clean and hairs aren't coming out all disproportionally. Get a haircut at least once every 2-3 weeks, but during this pandemic shit I have started to let my hair grow out. But still keep the back of your neck clean and shave the little baby hairs. 
* Candles- Any kind that doesn't smell like straight up food or is very sharp, unless you're into that, you want a good gentle smell which sort of resembles a cologne. Yankee candles are amazing, but if they are too much for you, then I suggest using the cheap ones. The cheap ones cost anywhere from $5-10. Do not spend too much on them, cheap ones smell good too. I use mostly lavender smells, because those ones are really mellow and sit nice in your room. 
* LED LIGHTS- Get some LED lights if you haven't already, put them around your walls and you can basically get any kind. These paired with a nice smelling candle create the best atmosphere for someone to be in.
* Teeth- Colgate floss and whitening toothpaste will do just fine, make sure you floss after eating anything and always keep it handy. 
* Lips- Just use carmex, and make sure to wipe the crust off the border of your lip-line, that shit is NASTY.   


This is basically it, you don't need a lot to keep yourself in check. If you think any of this is expensive, then I suggest you stop spending money on shit like V bucks and skins for the new COD battle pass, instead save up and invest in YOURSELF. If money is an issue for you, then go for the cheaper options but make sure they suit well on you, because a lot of bad lotions can fuck your skin up or make it oily. But yeah, start taking care of yourselves fellas, eat right, drink enough water throughout the day, LIFT, read, and start LOVING yourself. Girls appreciate a man that takes good care of himself, which has been mentioned many times in this community. Keep it chill and thank you for reading. 

TL;DR- Take good care of your skin, buy good lotions that are trusted and have good reviews, clean your room, make it comfortable for people to be in, make sure to always smell nice and this goes for your room as well. It really isn't that hard, put in time every day to improve your physique and appearance, and bitches will love you for it.",87,1

The death of the Modern Man," 

I was thinking about some stuff the other day and though it might be worth sharing it on here.  


Society is out to kill men, no I'm no talking about the high suicide rate among men or wars.

I'm talking about the fact that historically testosterone is at the lowest point it has been.

Due to shitty food and having estrogen in almost every thing you ingest.  


Our entire economy is based on men consuming things to impress women.

Think about it, do you need a new Iphone every two years? Do you need a fancy car? Designer clothes?

If you are happy with yourself and realize that YOU are more than enough for any woman you will stop buying those things.

""We buy things we don't need to impress people we don't like""  


Porn is another thing that is destroying the modern man.

Your lizard brain can't tell the difference between actual sex and you wanking one of to porn.

Hell your brain thinks porn is better than real life, it has access to an endless amount of mates. Accessible at any time. Exactly what the male mating programming needs.  


Being force fed trash estrogen filled food. 

A society that tells you you are not enough and you need to consume. 

Your brain that thinks you are actually a true alpha and fuck 10 different hotties each day.

These are the perfect ingredients to create a generation of Beta Bucks. 

Ready to marry all those post wall single moms because they consider themselves lucky to have access to a real pussy.

Control your diet.

Stop wasting money, save up as much as possible so you can retire early.

Stop watching porn.",175,1

TL;DR- Created a Telegram group for Indian Red Pillers. DM me or leave a comment to join.,"I saw a post here sometime ago on the supposed difference in Indian woman's nature and extra tough game here, then went on to check the now inactive r / RedpillIndia sub. I thought it would be an excellent idea to create a group for Red Pill Indians working on themselves and wanting to know more about the current state/scene of Game in different cities/states in India, and so I did create one.

Still it can't be the case that there are only 10 Indians on this sub. I understand people are scared of getting doxxed and reluctant in revealing themselves, but i believe it's irrational to be scared to join a Red Pill Telegram group. Not gonna try to hard to convince people with weak hearts and small appetites. Hence this dedicated post (Went through sub rules, not sure if this is against them or if I maybe should have got the mods' clearance first).

It got a minimal response. We got a few people from varied fields of work and pacing towards different goals, some of which have keeping up with Red Pilled concepts for a decade now. Our discussions so far has been very fun and educational, we covered game, lifestyle &amp; fashion, money, muscle building, biased laws, the imported feminism, general female imperative and blue pill brainwashing in our contemporary popular culture. The fundamentals will always stay the same but cultural nuances and tweaking on environment specific basis is important too.

Message me or leave a comment if you are interested in joining.

A short story of my experience developing some Dark Triad traits after experiencing a form of PTSD.,"Hello everybody, today I am going to talk about my personal experience living a certain period of my life as what we call ""dark triad"" and give details of which strategies I implemented and where it lead me in my journey this far.

As you may have already heard, DT consists of a good amount around 25% of three traits, narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy. After my mother passed away 2 years ago, I had the feeling I needed to cut off and unplug, her passing left me blank and emotionless. At this time, I suddenly stopped being the people pleaser and the ""good guy"" willing to help friends out of my heart and doing stuff I didn't really enjoy sometimes.

Later on, I visited a professional therapist and he concluded I had experienced some form of PTSD that led me to behave like a soulless person.

During this 2 year period, I experienced things I never thought I could achieve this easily, the first few months I started plating 3 different girls, and one of them got really invested so we ended up in a LTR after 5 months of casually dating, the interesting thing is I noticed she got addicted to me and very interested since we started dating, to pinpoint what I believe made this happen was that I was retracted and mysterious, sometimes I would forget to text her being busy with other girls or lifting, working and doing my stuff. Of course what played an important role is that I took her v-card, and she thought she couldn't do without me thanks to my subtle manipulation tactics, and I would always get what I wanted, not too much shit and bad behavior, always obedient, frequent sex and fun together etc. Until of course the relationship ran it's cycle, and she understood she will survive when I'm not around..but that is just natural and happens in every relationship. All of them have to end sometime, even though you might break up and she will still be looking for you, trying to get a reaction, or fuck with you again whatever.

\- The first few months I took lifting very seriously, I was not always available to friends or plates, I kept   
being busy with improving my-self and enjoying time alone too. This took a turn for the best, since   
others started respecting me more.

\- I started being more careful and kept mind notes of what people's weaknesses and strengths were, in case I they ever turned out to be against me, I would totally crush them without taking a serious hit in my reputation, relationships and well being. 

\- I wasn't always talking, and when I was I gave vague statements or answered with questions and kept the mystery flowing, this goes for women too. It's a highly effective strategy and also doesn't say much about you, one thing at a time, so that you keep the mysterious character that is attractive.

\- I started dressing more masculine, bought slim fit crew neck t-shirts, black white khaki beige red, and black white blue slim jeans. The all black outfit was my top that gave me lots of confidence and made me look tougher since I was also lifting. 

\- I started seeing situations and encounters as something to gain from, and used every leverage to my advantage, at first I thought people would notice but they really don't notice much of the manipulation going on, of course I'm not saying to be genuine and kind to people who are kind to you, but always think of what you can gain more and how you can achieve it and sometimes manipulation is the key. Before this period, I would think that manipulating is wrong and stuff but since I stopped fearing of what would happen I gained lots from it.

The whole point is to use everything to your advantage. I can't really explain this much into detail since it would take me weeks to post field reports and analytics, but what I learned from this period is that sometimes you have to get out of your way and do something you didn't use to do to get something you don't have. If you manage to have leverage in social situations, no one will fuck with you and the more masculine and violent you look the more respected you are, dress hot and lift weights, and learn to use the DGAF mentality often. What matters most when you are a dark triad is your personal benefit. You don't give a fuck what others will think or feel. 

I can tell with certainty now that some of my empathy starts coming back, slowly, but whenever I think of what I accomplished during this period it becomes easy again to start the same schemes. Other than that empathy just makes my life more complicated, faking interest if I have something to gain on the other hand, seems easier to me. But that's just me.

Now I am not really sure how to flair this, so I'll tag it Field Report.

TL;DR experienced a family member's death, left me cold and caused some form of PTSD, I developed DT personality traits over the course of 2 years and had great benefit. Manipulation, leverage and keeping secrets like weaknesses from showing is key to having the upper hand.",5,1
"Back to basics -- To stop living in her frame and stop setting covert contracts, you must be willing to not just fake it or make it, but BE it and embrace any authentic outcome, whatever that is.","**TL:DR - The basic mistakes are always the most deep rooted ones. To fix that is the hard part. You can't revise the basics enough.**

You can go over to mrp and check out the latest post (can't link) on this topic. Of late, I notice more and more posts (there and here) increasingly boiling down to talking about the most basic mistakes, things that were talked about in NMMNG. Somewhere along the way to being the man we want to be and get the life we want, we do everything else right, and it looks like when it comes to the skills and game, we've figured out almost everything we need. Except...

We haven't fixed the basic mistakes. Such as:

Too many ""she she she"" statements. Your very point of origin begins with a ""She""

Losing frame at the slightest shit test or discomfort

Losing frame at the slightest dose of pleasure and comfort -- yeah, that's the more evil twin.

Telling yourself you aren't butt hurt when things don't go your way when you clearly are seething inside.

Still living in her frame.

Doing everything right (are you?) and then asking some variant ""Why doesn't she grant me the prize of sex?"".

Covert Contracts &amp; Contracts with outcomes -- i.e. All the stuff that's not really in your control - reactions, emotions, consequences.

She is the prize.

Sex is the prize for being the man you were meant to be.

Oneitis - women, results, sex, and all of life.

Beta fanboying over the men who taught your how to be a man, then like a child you get butthurt when you realize they're not gods.

If you have ever tried your hand at mastering a skill or a musical instrument, one thing you quickly learn is that the basic stuff is the most underrated thing there is, and you can never take that lightly. As soon as you get complacent, not practicing, the first thing to start declining is the basics. 

In fact, our man Glover recently read his book all over again, and was shocked to realize he'd forgotten almost half of it. It must have been quite an eye opener for him.

The most basic mistakes are also the most deeply rooted mistakes. They are the first to come in, and the last to go out. They're well known, and still for many of us, even years later, they're not yet fixed.

The root cause is that you have one fixed outcome on your mind. That however is irrevocably in her hands. Therefore you continue to operate in her frame and surrender your personal power to her.

If you want these covert contracts to go away, you should be willing to let go of onetis for stuff that you really have no control over. You have to stop seeing your entire journey to manhood as Chapter 1,2 and god knows what number of a rather gigantic covert contract.

As I wrote in my last post, covert contracts are also the result of covert goals, aka your actual motivation for doing anything. Dig that out of the ground as soon as you spot it.

You can only work on actions, not reactions. You can only work on goals, not consequences.  You can only make yourself into the man you are meant to be, but you cannot determine how exactly the world will react to it.

And yes, we all start out with sex as the prize (even if it isn't that one woman, it's still sex). Changing this mentality to ""I am the prize"" with authenticity is the thing is the thing that's hardest to truly get and internalize. Sex isn't the ultimate prize, it's just one thing most missing in your life right now (and which your body craves).

Skills can be learnt, lines can be rehearsed, a gym routine can be worked out in a month, a sense of humor takes a few months, getting good at sex is an art, changing your style can take a lot of trial and error and etc..etc.. --  but all those things are skills. They can be nailed down to a T with enough practice. 

But doing this authentically as a way of life? Not just faking it and making it, but BEING it, that takes more. I am sure some people take the 1 month for every year of BP rule way too seriously and feel entitled to the results on the 31st of December or whatever date they set because the author of the book said so and and aren't very happy when faced with the reality. Guys, facing the truth is what being an authentic man is about. Making it isn't the point, it's still temporary and conditional. Being it is what matters.

Instead, as painful as it might sound, get into accepting whatever be the authentic outcome that arises out of living as the man in your life. When you have broken the oneitis for an outcome, you are now open to allow many other possibilities beyond your imagination to enter instead. 

This gives you a new found inner strength to deal with shit (that's probably something you'll be grateful for in the long run). That makes you more attractive in the bigger picture. Unless you're ready for anything, you're not really ready.

Thing of everything that's attractive or beautiful or profound in your life life. The most authentically attractive aren't doing it for your approval -- that's just the way there are. They don't fade away the instant you're looking somewhere else. That's the energy they put out, and we just fall in love with what they are.

I Have Other People For That,"Another story of my adventures with a Red Pill message:
 
This happened just yesterday so it is fresh in my mind. I have a FWB who is pretty cute, just not relationship material for me. Kind of reserved (except under some circumstances) and frankly too boring to do anything with except get laid once in a while. She‚Äôs intellectual and cool, but usually not spontaneous.  

She texted me in the morning asking what I was up to that day, and if I wanted to go for a walk. Now, from past experience I know we‚Äôve joked about that term before because on our third date she came over for a walk and we walked to my bedroom after dinner and had sex and it became a running joke. So I was pretty sure I knew what she wanted. 

When she arrived I could tell something was up and she had been crying. Of course my Nice Guy ‚Ñ¢ instinct came roaring out and I asked her what was wrong. She told me her cousin she was close with had dropped dead unexpectedly the day before. Now, of course that was unusual. And for most men, the first instinct is to be the shoulder, support, etc. But I knew deep down that wasn‚Äôt why she wanted to see me. Because I'm not that guy to her normally.  

I told her to sit down and poured her a drink and after one sip, she broke down and started to cry. Again, first instinct is to hug her and tell her everything is going to be okay. But I knew that she was there for a reason, and I just had to give her the right environment. This is why I practice stoicism. Let her cry, it‚Äôs no big deal.  

Once she calmed down a bit she turned to me and gave me the eyes I had been looking for. And it was on. We barely made it out of the living room for the first round and then kept at it for another one after a short rest. And I was basically going primal on her and she was loving every moment. Spanking, hair pulling, the whole gambit. Amazing sex. Best she‚Äôs honestly ever given me. She was obviously letting out some grief all over my house.
 
We recovered and she essentially rolled over and started to gather her clothes to leave. Because I wanted more sex, I offered for her to stay and hang out. We could talk about it and I could make her lunch.  

The next words out of her mouth were the main lesson: 

‚ÄúI have other people for that.‚Äù 

What this says is that she didn‚Äôt want me for emotional support, she didn‚Äôt want me for a shoulder to cry on or a cuck idiot who would play with her hair and tell her everything was going to be okay. She wanted me for hard dirty sex. More importantly ‚Äì she wanted me to take her away from her life for an hour or two so she could have fun and forget about something she was upset about. 

Always remember that women are emotional creatures FIRST. Most men think if they have empathy and be the nice guy that it will help them get laid. Instead, what they are doing is putting themselves into a box labelled NICE GUY and she won‚Äôt think of sex when she thinks of you.

What you want instead is to have her think that when she wants good sex to distract her or make her feel better for a short moment, she thinks of you. And that can be all she thinks of when it comes to you, and that‚Äôs just dandy in my book.  

In Robert Greene‚Äôs The Art Of Seduction (which I highly recommend) he talks about 9 seduction archetypes that apply to both women you‚Äôre trying to seduce AND you as the seducer. The best seducers can shift from one to another but specialize in one or two. 

With any woman, you need to find out what she‚Äôs in the mood for and become that person in order to become their go to sex partner ‚Äì and make sure they keep coming back. You also need to be able to read people well and figure out if they want caveman or something different. Most women are submissive instinctively, which is a good default. But there are varying degrees of submissive.  

I‚Äôm ideally the Charmer or the Ideal Lover because that suits my personality. If you figure out your best seduction style then you‚Äôll more easily be able to target women in a way that is more natural. But you should also work on the others so that like a chameleon, you can use whatever tool you need in order to seduce and get laid. Sometimes blunt force like a hammer won‚Äôt work, but a finely tipped screwdriver working slowly will. 

It means you have to be able to read the situation and apply things accordingly. When this girl showed up at my place and then I figured out she was grieving, it would have been easy to succumb to the Nice Guy syndrome I used to have and just be the shoulder. But that wasn‚Äôt what she wanted. She wanted to get laid. And I was happy to provide. 

Sometimes it just falls into your lap (like this time) but there was a message behind it. She had other people to provide emotional support, a shoulder, etc. What she wanted from me was something different. Be the guy that gives her that.",167,1

Why are women in Oregon/California so opinionated and aggressive?,"I am from Austria but have been spending time living in Montana since November. Earlier this month, I traveled with my Mormon friend who lives in Logan, Utah. A small city between two mountain ridges. We took a car and made a trip out west. I mean why not? I wanted to see how he would react and I don't really know the West Coast. Only Montana and the Eastern US.

His sisters and girlfriend don't wear pants and everything is very strict in his family and town. Out west, we started in Portland, made our way towards Eugene then continued down to Northern California until we reached San Diego, a city by the border of Mexico. 

WOW. You see a different America out west. 

I noticed that women in the cities we visited in, especially the bigger ones, are very opinionated and aggressive. They often take drugs and are interested in obscure subcultures and astrology. 

Now, of course, we could say that the Mormons in Utah are weird but look at this from my eyes and my friend. The women in Montana, Utah, and even in my home town in Austria, are not as indulgent, opinionated, and aggressive as the young women of Oregon and California, especially California. 

Yes, there are religious and conservative people out west as well. But over in the Californian cities, which are overwhelmed with poverty, we just saw something we weren't used to. 

Interestingly enough, in Utah and Montana, men are more masculine and women are more feminine. In California, it was more common to see masculine behavior in women, such as the use of profanity, which shocked my Mormon friend because his mother and sisters back home would never speak like this. Of course, there are also the tattoos, the piercings, the ketamine, the ayahuasca, the vulgar dancing, the weird Egyptian and Wicca rituals, the little Buddhist knick-knacks, the dancing, the materialism, the cosmetic surgeries, and the sexualized nature of everything. 

Is this a city/culture in decline? I also saw one of the most despicable things ever. Apparently many of the young women there are using dating apps to meet men in order to obtain luxuries from them. My god, what sort of society is this?",4,1

Why You Should Even Bother.,"I recently saw a post on AskTRP from a guy who from what I can tell genuinely couldn't think of a reason to keep continuing in the RP path.

To make a long story short, I asked myself this very question about a year into my journey and had a hard time coming up with an answer and almost gave up. 

Then I realized that I wouldn't be able to respect myself for choosing mediocrity. If I wouldn't be able to respect myself, I sure as Hell wasn't going to be able to garner respect from anyone else and would be resigning myself to be disrespected by others.

That's when I knew why, regardless of the SMP, politics, Tinder and Instagram bs, regardless of women with inflated egos, regardless of simps devaluing male attention, regardless of all of that I would and will continue to make an effort to be a high value man.

Not for women's sake. Not for society's sake. For my sake. I choose to continue to work to be a high value man because that is the kind of man I can respect.

So if you find yourself asking""Why bother?"" Ask yourself what actions a man you can respect would take.",119,1
The Decline Is All We Have,"This is in response to a post bitching about us not talking about tradition and only wanting to get our dicks wet. So why doesn't TRP want to talk about tradition? Is it because we are gen x dad bod nonlifting degenerates? No, it's mostly because the matrix is the real world and there are real consequences. 

You see, when Neo takes the redpill he gets unplugged both physically and mentally. Unfortunately for us, there is no Zion, we will still be stuck in America. There is no USB that you can stick in your ass that makes you gain superpowers like flying or dodging bullets. When the Smith agents smash your face in who are you gonna call? Your mom?

Next we have the claim that society is built on masculine virtues, that is true. Unfortunately for you buddy, masculine virtues are very inconvenient in todays society. Women and minorities would suffer if true masculine virtues made a [comeback](https://youtu.be/9YpCpV4YMIU)

So not only will you have the agents smiths on your back, but you'll probably have 3/4 of the american population wanting your head on a stick. But wait, there's more!

Let's say you actually did manage to pull it off. You made yourself a little nu-american nation of masculine men and sandwich makers in the middle of Nebraska. Every baby will be reading The Republic at the age of 5 and Evola at the age of 10. 
Do you think the Big Gay Empire will allow this to continue? 

How will you protect your little nation against economic sanctions, infiltrators and [democracy](https://youtu.be/6_dHxgjc9Q4) ?

If liberals hate you they'll call you a dictator and if pea brain conservatives hate you they'll call you a socialist. In the end it'll be your tiny masculine nation against the Western world and it is unlikely you'll survive.

**Conclusion**

If you're a traditionalist you only have two options. You can move to a traditionalist country with guns big enough to protect itself. Or you can stay in America and maybe help things accelerate. 

Why are traditionalists bound to fail in America? Its simple math really.

How To Slide Your White Meat Into Asian Girls,[removed],0,1
Do dudes REALLY want kids? Like....*really*?,"feminists are always quick to point to a smattering of studies that show more men report wanting kids than women (something like 90% vs 82% supposedly)

i've always had a very deep, visceral fear/revulsion response to babies (i like kids just fine, to a point, but i also like straight pickled jalapeno juice...to a point).  it's DEEP in my DNA, this absolute panic response at the mere notion of a mini-me running around, but according to these studies I'm in a distinct, overwhelming minority.

my question is this.....strip away everything else--- societal expectations, the knowledge that the majority of women will invariably hinge your entire worth on whether you will impregnate and support her and her children, that if you flat-out refuse to consider having kids that puts you in an automatic quarantine that renders 8 out of 10 women (at least) uninterested in you at best, openly contemptuous at worst.

i mean, it's not like i see 39 year old guys running around in a panic to find a surrogate so he can be a single father.  clearly that basic compulsion is just NOT THERE--- which l leads me to believe men are driven to have children for performance/status reasons, relentless pressure from family, society at large, and most of all *women*, and because it's nearly impossible to win the long term ""love"" of a woman otherwise (and gosh golly it's such brain-teaser how that's gonna turn out for you 10 years down the road, pal).

so am i the weird one?  the 9% oddball that knew even when i was a kid i wanted nothing to do with kids?  do 91% really have baby fever deep down in your nutsacs?",7,1

Race to the Top 2: Electric Boogaloo (The Red Pill Guide for Minorities),"*original credit for the post goes to u/needless_pickup_line*

*Why did I repost it?  Because it needs to be said &amp; to get black/brown men talking. Now read and learn...*

**If this gets shadowbanned again then you REALLY know it‚Äôs legit**
Lately I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of race talk pop up around here, and as usual these discussions have been  **A FUCKING SHITSHOW.** Between the stormfront armchair alphas, Uncle Toms, and the chronic masturbating, Facebook-creeping FOBs it's no fucking surprise that these discussions are useless. But never fear, lads, because your favorite diaper-headed, goat-fucking, stone-throwing shitskin is here to deliver some culturally diverse wisdom from on high.
I originally posted this race guide a year ago. Since then TRP has nearly doubled in size, and with the influx of race discussion the time is ripe to revisit the topic of how minorities can successfully navigate the sexual marketplace. I've gotten plenty of lays and plenty of rejections, and I'm gonna share my knowledge with you. Let's get to it.
________________________________________
**1. The Reality of the Situation**
TRP in general does not give a shit about minorities and will largely ignore the dating handicaps specific to minorities. The Red Pill is a reactionary response to the modern liberal/social justice movement, which loves to blame the vague specters of 'racism' and 'patriarchy' as the source of all minority ills; leading to things like affirmative action and tone-policing. In response TRP tends to over-correct to the right and minimize racism entirely. For example, we love to discuss the evil of affirmative action and how the lazy, unqualified minorities are stealing jobs and scholarships from honest hard-working white men, but then ignore the demonstrable fact that resumes with 'white' names get significantly more callbacks. Humans love to simplify complex issues to black and white (heh), and The Red Pill is no exception.
The Reddit demographic is overwhelmingly young, white, and male, and TRP reflects that. Coming to TRP for race advice rarely works because you are addressing a population that largely has no understanding of or interest in your experience. White guys couldn't give less of a shit if minorities are getting laid. It's a lot fucking easier to yell out **#IndianRaceTroll** and enjoy all the sweet minority pussy riding the CC. Even if they did give a shit, they don't know what it's like to actually be a minority and deal with women, so all they can do is regurgitate the same vaguely condescending advice. ""Hmmm, have you tried being more Alpha??""
Look at all the hero worship /u/gaylubeoil gets...then remember that his advice to Asian men was to wait for Asian women to hit the wall then eat the superior Caucasian jizz out of their used up twats. Or this superstar whose sage wisdom was to just try being a .01% professional athlete. And of course there‚Äôs the ever popular advice to just casually make a shit ton of money, then buy a woman‚Äôs affection. It‚Äôs not BB without the BUCK$, right? That's the kind of bullshit 'advice' you're gonna get on TRP.
Stop waiting for some magic strategy that will finally unlock the secrets of pussy. If you want to get laid, you're gonna have to WORK. Don't let the echo chamber suck you in. Yes, you would probably do better with women if you were white, but you are who you are. You cannot change, only improve; but that is impossible so long as you remain in that ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù mindset. Your game will suffer for it, and women can smell that shit a mile away.

**2. Why Are White Men Preferred**
Just because you are a minority does not mean you are doomed to be incel. Just because you are white does not mean you automatically get laid. However, as members of TRP so thoughtfully remind us, the Western world and modern society was built by white men. (Thanks again guys we really appreciate it) Therefore the natural result is that society's default perspective is white. White men dominate business, government, and the media. Women don't prefer white men because they are superior physical specimens, they prefer them because white men represent STATUS. It's social conditioning. CEOs are white. Movie stars are white. Politicians are white. Who is brown? The garbagemen, the dishwashers, and the creeps on Facebook. In popular culture, white men represent the standard of attractiveness. Anything else is deviant and ultimately seen as inferior. **When you hear the name 'Chad Thundercock', the man you picture is inevitably WHITE.**
When we say women prefer white men we‚Äôre not saying that women choose pasty neckbeards over fit and confident minorities, we‚Äôre saying that society conditions us to both view Caucasian features as most attractive and Caucasian people as higher class. If height, facial symmetry, and physique are controlled, women will prefer the white man 9/10 times. And this mentality isn‚Äôt uniquely Western. Thanks to globalization and a history of colonialism, in many foreign countries (Latin America, Middle East, India, Asia) the most attractive members of society are those with the lightest skin and most European features, while the darker and more ethnic looking population is considered undesirable.
TRP constantly shits on women. They're children, they're immature, they're emotional. Yet somehow women are immune to the pervasive message of white superiority that permeates Western society. Women are incredibly susceptible to external influence, and right now that influence is that minorities are inferior. Indians shit in public. Asians have small dicks. Migrants are ruining America. Even our ROYALTY is fucking insane.
You're delusional if you think all of this has no effect on a woman's sexual preference, either consciously or subconsciously. And thanks to in-group/out-group bias YOU'RE FUCKED just because some piece of shit 10,000 miles away that vaguely resembles you doesn't know how to use a fucking toilet.

**3. Step Your Game Up**
At first this seems like the same ‚Äòbasic‚Äô advice I criticized earlier, but sexual success as a minority depends not only on a high SMV, but UNDERSTANDING why maximizing your SMV is critical. To get laid as a minority, your sexual game must be ruthless and preemptive. Your race is already a mark against you in her eyes. You can't afford to have any shortcomings because there's a white guy out there who doesn't and your little oneitis is constantly looking to upgrade. White boys can get away with being out of shape, or dressing poorly, or being a little boring. Not us. You need to be lifting, dressing sharp, perfecting your game, grooming yourself, and oozing sex appeal. This serves two purposes:
Firstly, this will determine if your race is actually what's holding you back. Too many times I see guys on TRP mention their 30% bodyfat then wondering if they're not getting laid because of their race. It's not the color of your skin, it's your manboobs and love handles. My fellow nationals love to give me shit for maintaining my physique and say things like ‚ÄúMiddle Eastern men aren‚Äôt supposed to work out‚Äù, then in the same breath complain that ‚Äòour women‚Äô always go for white and black guys. Get your fucking house in order before you play the race card.
Secondly, because women prefer white men you need to ensure that you are superior in other aspects in order to overcome that preference. If girls prefer white guys if things are equal, then make sure they‚Äôre NOT. He's 20% BF, you're 10%. His clothes are off the rack, yours are tailored to fit. His jokes are lame, while you're demolishing her shit tests.
Hypergamy rules all and it won't matter what race either of you are when you're the clearly superior choice. Coming out the gate hot and radiating sexual energy will set the tone for the whole interaction and keep you out the beta zone. By ‚Äúradiating energy‚Äù I mean being open and confident with your body, not hiding your sexual appetite, and perfecting your application of kino.
The only area where you don't have to be on top of your shit is income, and that's only because it'll weed out women looking for an easy BB.

**4. Kill Your Fetish**
BLONDE BIMBO BLONDE BIMBO BLONDE BIMBO
It's a fucking obsession for some of you. You know who you are. You guys want to bitch and moan about how girls only want white guys, then turn around and lust after WHITE GIRLS with even more restrictive criteria. Not only is the irony is lost on you, but that desperate thirst permeates your entire lives. It‚Äôs incredibly off-putting, and that‚Äôs just from reading the PMs some of you have sent me. I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine what talking to you in person must be like.
I'm not saying stay in your lane and only fuck girls within your race, but you need to really be honest with yourself about why you want some bleach blonde Barbie doll with fake titties. Are you trying to prove something? I could understand if it was a desire for white girls in general, but for many of you it‚Äôs this specific, outdated stereotype that‚Äôs no longer relevant. You‚Äôre like a 5‚Äô2‚Äù guy lusting after WNBA players from 1996.
It‚Äôs not enough that you want a white girl, she needs to be a rich Sorority Girl‚Ñ¢. That‚Äôs just as unrealistic as a white guy who wants an Arab girl with a thong under her hijab. Yeah they exist but they‚Äôre not fucking with you. Get rid of your fucking entitlement and be practical with your sexual interest. You lost the privilege of being choosy the second you decided to complain about your lack of options.

**5. Avoid Stereotypes**
High SMV women are always looking for reasons to disqualify you. This is doubly true for minority men. They have stereotypes in mind and they‚Äôre just waiting for you to confirm them. You must be vigilant. Watch your words and actions and defy their expectations. For example, I‚Äôm not even Muslim, but God forbid I ever speak in favor of ‚Äútraditional‚Äù or ‚Äúold-fashioned‚Äù relationships. Then I‚Äôm the backwards patriarchal misogynist who only likes circumcised women. No wonder the Middle East is a shithole. Substitute gang rape, daughter abortion, hood mentality, or Machismo as needed.
Law 38 **(Think as you like but Behave like others)** is especially vital. Obviously we have better things to do with our time than debating women, but when it comes to discussions about gender roles and relationships, white men have much more leeway in what opinions they can voice. Keep your head down when it comes to controversial topics unless you‚Äôre in a known, comfortable group. But also, referring to point 3, the higher your SMV the less you rock the boat. Think of the difference between ‚Äòcreepy‚Äô and ‚Äòfunny‚Äô.
This isn‚Äôt limited to conversations, but to all potential situations where you might be judged. If you‚Äôre Indian, don‚Äôt try chatting up girls on your way back from the gym or after a fragrant meal. If you're black, make sure you're well-read and informed on current events. If you‚Äôre Asian and a ‚Äògrower‚Äô, rethink those boxer swim shorts when you hit the beach. You know the stereotypes. Don‚Äôt give them weapons to use against you.

**6. Avoid conflict**
This is related to #5 but is so important it needs to be addressed on its own. When you as a minority go for a girl of a different race, people WILL give you shit. Mainly guys who feel they are above you on the ‚Äòhierarchy‚Äô of race (White&gt;Black/Hispanic&gt;Arab/Asian). Sure, you two might have shared a beer 10 minutes earlier, but now they see your girl, they like your girl, and they want your girl. In their minds they can convince her to ditch you and ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù, and THEY‚ÄôRE NOT WRONG. If you lose frame, that‚Äôs exactly what she‚Äôll do. If you get jealous, mate guard, lash out, or talk back, you play right into their hand. Especially if it‚Äôs a white guy banking on you being an angry minority. Obviously you have more leeway for an LTR, but not total immunity. A cool head must always prevail. Amused mastery is your friend. ""It‚Äôs 2015, I thought racism was dead."" Ideally your opponent will seem backwards and insecure instead of you.
The more subtle and insidious threat will be the people who try to shame you for not going after the girls of your own race. Fuck them. They‚Äôre either jealous guys or girls of your own race who want a soft BB landing when they fly off the carousel. Black women especially are pros at this (and all the Steve Harvey ""Think Like A Man"" bullshit from recent years has made it worse; watch them change their tune when they actually get some White attention), but even white girls get in on the action trying to shame white guys into staying away from Asian girls. Don‚Äôt engage them or try to debate them. I always say that I‚Äôll start dating Middle Eastern girls when they do the same, but even that I feel is too much.

**7 Embrace your culture‚Ä¶**
One tactic I‚Äôve seen for minorities is to bury their ethnicity, whitewash themselves, and try to blend in as much as possible. That is the equivalent of ab implants. On the small chance they‚Äôre not immediately ridiculed, they don‚Äôt hold up to any kind of close inspection. A minority who tries to ignore his looks or heritage performs a similar act of insecurity. We are not white and never will be. Don‚Äôt pretend otherwise. Women love pride and confidence. And trust me, there‚Äôs nothing better than boldly saying ‚ÄúI am X‚Äù with that strong sense of culture and history, especially when the random white guy next to you ‚Äúthinks his grandma was German, maybe‚Äù before trailing off mumbling something about 1/16th Cherokee.
Exception: The only people who can pull this off are minority guys who are half-white. Often times they have to 'pick a side'. Stay true to your roots, but play up the white aspects if you're trying to get girls. White girls will like you because you're exotic and different enough to be interesting but still white enough to not be alienating. Minority girls will like you because you allow them to satisfy their white hypergamy but you're still ethnic enough to not make them feel like they're selling out.
This is counterpoint to #5. Don‚Äôt be ‚Äòthe foreigner‚Äô, but know your history, culture, and where you came from; and don‚Äôt be shy if an appropriate opportunity comes up for you to discuss it. This leads into the next point. Embrace your heritage‚Ä¶

**8 ‚Ä¶But give them what they want**
White girls love war bonnets, dream catchers, moccasins, and those vaguely tribal designs they find on clothing at ‚Äúvintage‚Äù stores. But how many of them care to learn about Native American history or, God forbid, actually visit the rez? They love all the flashy accoutrement of foreign cultures (especially the food‚Ä¶) but care very little for cultural significance or respectful admiration. To them, appreciating another culture means appropriation and accessorizing. Think of how much women love ‚Äòtravel‚Äô and compare that to what they actually do while abroad. Spoiler: it‚Äôs the same fucking shit they do at home, just with a foreign filter and a smug sense of false worldliness.
When pursuing Western women, you need to give them a similar experience. I am North African. When I‚Äôm with girls and culture comes up all they care about are khamsas, mint tea, hookah, and belly dancing. That‚Äôs what appeals to them. And even then you can see their eyes glaze over and their hands twitch for their phones if I mention the history and significance of those things. They want superficial enjoyment without any deeper understanding. Don‚Äôt try to educate them, just sweep them up in the ride. I can take them to any shitty ahwa (Arabic caf√©) and they act like it‚Äôs something out of Arabian Nights. Figure out the equivalent for your race/ethnicity and learn how to present it, and make damn well sure you know the best place in town for [insert race here] food. With shining eyes they will look at you and profess how wonderful it is that you thought they were special enough to introduce to your culture. Try not to roll your eyes.
The question remains as to when to bust out these cultural big guns. Honestly, if you're at the point where you can take a girl to a bhangra show, tea ceremony, or cultural art exhibit, then you're pretty much already in. In fact, some of these things might be too intense for a first meetup. Rather, you want to dole out ethnic theatrics gradually. Unless culture was explicitly discussed and she expressed interest, you want the first date or two to be normal RP. Feel free to tease her about how awesome your culture is and that you might bring her around if she's cool enough. Don't dump it on her, allow her to 'explore'. Then throughout the relationship you can periodically ""include"" her in the ethnic activities. The point is to not make it a gimmick, but another tool in your arsenal.
Again, keep point #5 in mind. Don‚Äôt lay it on too thick or you‚Äôll be typecast. We are more than our ethnicity, all of us. Respect yourself as an individual. We defy stereotypes and racism because we refuse to allow others to define us solely by our race. Don‚Äôt do the same to yourself.

**9 Know your demographic**
This point seems antithetical to the rest of the guide, but the truth is that you are going to do better with certain women and certain scenarios versus others. It‚Äôs the concept of diminishing returns. Yes, you can and should go for any women you want, wherever you want, but if you want the biggest bang for your buck (pun intended) you‚Äôll know how to strategize.

9a: Location
For example, unless you are extraordinarily fit or good looking (top 5%), Tinder or online dating is not your best bet. Whereas the top 20% or so of white men can compete online, only the top 5% (Asian and Indian) and 10% (Latino and Black) can do the same. Online dating massively enables a woman‚Äôs hypergamy and there‚Äôs no point in her settling for you when a better option is a few swipes away. I had a white roommate who is shorter, chubbier, and less attractive than myself, but he matched with girls on Tinder FAR more often than I did. (Whether he actually closed is another thing entirely) However, if we walked into a party together he would be invisible. In real life, my confidence and swagger shine through in a way that isn't possible on a phone screen. While he was matching with girls every week, I was consistently picking up girls on the weekends. It‚Äôs all about context.
Similarly, for a minority a cold daygame approach is an uphill battle. Yeah we‚Äôve all seen the videos where the Asian PUA gets phone numbers, but how often do you think those girls text back? In my experience it‚Äôs not worth the time and effort unless you can establish some connection (ie not just talking to her on some random sidewalk) Your best bets are parties and social events, through your circle of friends, and clubs and group activities; basically any situation where you‚Äôre not judged solely on your looks. If you‚Äôre lifting and taking care of your appearance, girls will find you attractive, but these are situations where you can use your game, confidence, presence, and force of personality to overcome any hesitation a girl may have for your race. You know where I see Asian guys with white girls? I see them at house parties, hiking trails, and art museums. I don't see them at nightclubs or frat parties. Learn to work the venue.
Unsurprisingly, concerts and music festivals are also great place to find receptive girls. Once you bust out some sweet moves, that girl rolling won‚Äôt give a fuck what color you are.

9b: Geography
Not all areas are the same for picking up women. Obviously you should never uproot your life solely for women, but if you have the choice of locale or you're visiting then bear this in mind. Essentially, geography can be broken down into three areas: **climate, competition, and scarcity.**
**Climate:** Not the weather, but the vibe of the city and what the ideal is. If you're in Santa Barbara or another beach town and girls are running after blonde surfer beach boys then you're gonna have a bad time. Likewise if you're in the deep South and there's lingering racial tension. Compare those locations to a place like south Florida. Proximity to the Caribbean and multicultural demographics make it much friendlier for minorities.
**Competition:** Who are you running up against? In a world-class city like New York you're competing with the cream of the crop. Lawyers, brokers, Old Money, male models, etc. TRP advocates BECOMING one of those world-class men, but until you do so you're playing out of your league. Compare that to the Pacific Northwest (Seattle and Portland), crawling with politically correct SJW/BP beta guys. Frame and game will take you far.
**Scarcity:** Where the white women at? If you want a white girl, then find out where they are. Attractive white women are rare in San Francisco, and on top of that there are plenty of Asian and Indian guys to go around. Their value becomes hugely inflated. Compare that to the Midwest where pretty white girls are a dime a dozen.

9c: Race and Culture
The other factors to take into account are the race and culture of the girl you pursue. After a certain amount of time you will find out which girls are the most receptive to you, and act accordingly. For myself, if I put in the base amount of effort, I can close an attractive Latina or mixed girl, a decent white girl, and a below average Asian. So I tend to go for Hispanic/Black/mixed-race women, avoid Asian women entirely, and handle White women on a case-by-case basis. Therefore the overall quality of the women I date and my rate of success are significantly higher than if I approached all women equally. The farther away you are from a woman's 'racial ideal', the more she will shit test you. In her mind, you have to compensate for your race by being especially Alpha.
By 'culture' I mean the social situation and preference of the girl you pursue. This also depends on where you are meeting women. For example, white men dominate Hollywood, government, and business. The closer women are to those spheres, the more they are going to pursue and value white men. Likewise, look at black men in athletics, music, and entertainment. The same applies. Different scenes will have different standards. A ‚Äòcountry‚Äô girl might exclusively date white guys, while a girl who actually lived on a farm will be open to minorities. Distinctions are paramount. Girls who overly value ‚Äòimage‚Äô will take significantly more work.

9d: Breaking it down by race
What has been true in my experience. If you don't know where to look start here. Obviously not including girls of your own race.
**Black:** White girls blasting Childish Gambino and Drake, hip Asian girls on dance teams, and any Middle Eastern girl who isn't too religious. Seriously. Kim Kardashian isn't doing anything new. Arab girls LOVE black guys, anything to piss off baba.
**Indian:** Asian girls are receptive and Hispanic girls are down for the brown. Same color, different flavor.
**Middle Eastern:** Just like Indian guys, Hispanic girls are fair game. If you tend towards the white side (Lebanese, Armenian, Persian, etc.), then white girls are a viable option as long as you keep that SMV high. If you tend towards the black side (Moroccan, Egyptian, etc.), then black and mixed girls are gonna be all over you.
**Hispanic:** Keeping up that cultural exchange, middle eastern girls are great, especially if you're a good dancer. And like Arab guys, if you're whiter (Argentinian, from Jalisco, etc.) you can go after white girls and if you're blacker (Puerto Rican, Dominican, etc.) go after the black and mixed girls.
**Asian:** Nerdy white girls that read too much manga are usually down, along with black girls, as they represent the other low-SMV race for women and will welcome the attention. Besides that, the 'easy' way is to get really good at something then plow through girls in that area. The Asian guys I know that get hot (including white) girls are creative types (singer, dancer, artist, etc.) or talented athletes that are great at what they do.
If you‚Äôve been working on your SMV any girl is worth a shot. Don‚Äôt let this point dissuade you. Just be aware of the context within which you pursue any girl and decide if you‚Äôre making progress. Evaluating your interaction is a dynamic process. The key here is to not put the pussy on a pedestal. Sometimes for guys the idea of fucking the blonde sorority girl (#4) is more appealing than the actual act.

**10. The BlackPeopleTwitter Effect**
You ever check out the blackpeopletwitter subreddit? It‚Äôs filled with memes and jokes from the perspective of Black popular culture. But whenever there‚Äôs a post critical of white people or poking fun at them, you can guarantee the comments section blows up with slighted whites eager to defend themselves. Use that insecurity to your advantage. This is the biggest piece of actual strategy that wasn‚Äôt included in the original post. Turn the tables and tap into White guilt and fear of exclusion to neg girls and AMOG guys.
Be ruthless with white stereotypes. THEY‚ÄôRE LAME. They‚Äôre weird. They age like shit. They can‚Äôt dance. Their food is bland. White people put cucumber slices in water to make it less spicy. Call her out on her Ugg boots and Starbucks. Give that frat star shit about his Sperrys and button down. White people are dumb rednecks, boring and basic suburbians, or out-of-touch 1 percenters. They can‚Äôt win. If they try to get racial back then you use the liberal machine to your advantage, and make THEM look like the bad guys. When these white guys get pissy just call them autistic and throw out a line about them shooting the place up. Once you‚Äôve dominated them socially and physically just wait for the girls‚Äô war bride mentality to kick in and scoop them up.
The trick here is to be subtle with these comments. Aggressively opening with reverse racism is just going to exclude you more. Wait for an opening to present itself, and then strike. Anyone who‚Äôs spent any amount of time with white people can tell you those opportunities arise quickly and abundantly. A hard stare down and an eye roll will move mountains.

**11. NEVER DATE A RACE TRAITOR**
We all know these girls. Asian and Indian girls are the worst offenders. They are a liberal and 'educated' veneer over a damaged, self-hating core. **Race traitors are NOT simply girls who date outside their race.** Rather, they constantly talk shit about the men of their race, and systemically ignore them romantically, as they ride the carousel HARD until the wall hits and they‚Äôre forced to come crawling back to their ‚Äòculture‚Äô and carve out a cushy life for themselves with a BB husband and a dead bedroom. Throw in the secret orgy sex tape that hubby finds and the Reddit relationships post writes itself.
The hypocrisy is astounding. They talk about how men of their race are creepy losers, not realizing they‚Äôre shitting on their own brothers and fathers. Next time you hear an Indian girl talk about how Indian men are pussies, ask her if her sons are gonna be half or full-blooded pussy and watch her head explode. TRP does not advocate anger against women but if anyone deserves it it's these women. This might seem like a small point compared to the rest but the massive hypergamy of race traitors further skews the SMP, necessitating this guide. They're usually smart enough to at least not be single mothers by the time the wall hits, but they will **ALWAYS** find their BB.
If you keep working on your SMV and dating women, eventually these girls will come around. You're the perfect package. The AF they crave so much wrapped in a socially-acceptable same race package. They get to ride the carousel with no stigma. They're happy, their parents are happy, everyone wins...except you. DO NOT FALL FOR THEIR TRAP. They will work hard to rope you in and pretend they are the perfect package. Even if you ignore the whore past, the facade will inevitably crumble. Do not date them, do not marry them. They are only good for the pump and dump.
On the plus side, if you show up with a white girl on your arm, these minority girls will be the easiest fucking lays of your life and will pull the most sexually depraved shit to prove to you (and themselves) that her pussy is just as good as Stacey's.

"The one thing in the world a woman hates to do the most, is to think","She is a creature of emotion, feeling, intuition, lust and fear. These are FEELINGS. She does not think, she feels. To her, feelz=reelz. It really is that simple. That is why she wants an alpha male, because then she never has to think again and thinking is the thing she hates the most. She doesn‚Äôt need to be scared in the presence of an alpha male and she doesn‚Äôt need to make any decisions at all. She never makes decisions based on logic unless she is forced to. It is not that she cannot think, she just does not want to.

Women are the same as a beta male, they don‚Äôt want to lead, they want to follow. This is why beta males turn her stomach. If she has a beta male, she still needs to THINK! To make matters even worse, she is deprived of feelz, which is what she craves the most. To her, feelz=reelz. This is why old school PUA works (it still works just the same but it is a lost art). Old school PUA showed you how to get into her mind. It was a shortcut, and she loves shortcuts. She can get feelz from any man who is inside her head. We all know that once you are inside her head, you will very soon be inside her pussy.

So now you have the most obvious explanation for literally everything she says and does. It is based on feelz. If she has to THINK then the feelz recede. Logic is the death of emotion, women loathe logic. Using logic or reason on a woman to calm her down is like trying to bathe a cat. So in summary you need to do all the thinking for the duration of your interactions with women. Whether it is for a few hours, a few meetings or a few years. No matter what the duration the rules are the same. It is a bit like fight club, the first rule of game is to lead. The second rule of game is to lead. Just remember, you just say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, you can trust me‚Äù. If you do all the thinking then she doesn‚Äôt have to, she feels safe, horny and contented - feelz = reelz",70,1
Race to the Top 2: Electric Boogaloo (The Red Pill Guide for Minorities),"*repost from u/needless_pickup_line*

*Why?  Because it needs to be said. Now read and learn...*

Lately I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of race talk pop up around here, and as usual these discussions have been  **A FUCKING SHITSHOW.** Between the stormfront armchair alphas, Uncle Toms, and the chronic masturbating, Facebook-creeping FOBs it's no fucking surprise that these discussions are useless. But never fear, lads, because your favorite diaper-headed, goat-fucking, stone-throwing shitskin is here to deliver some culturally diverse wisdom from on high.
I originally posted this race guide a year ago. Since then TRP has nearly doubled in size, and with the influx of race discussion the time is ripe to revisit the topic of how minorities can successfully navigate the sexual marketplace. I've gotten plenty of lays and plenty of rejections, and I'm gonna share my knowledge with you. Let's get to it.
________________________________________
**1. The Reality of the Situation**
TRP in general does not give a shit about minorities and will largely ignore the dating handicaps specific to minorities. The Red Pill is a reactionary response to the modern liberal/social justice movement, which loves to blame the vague specters of 'racism' and 'patriarchy' as the source of all minority ills; leading to things like affirmative action and tone-policing. In response TRP tends to over-correct to the right and minimize racism entirely. For example, we love to discuss the evil of affirmative action and how the lazy, unqualified minorities are stealing jobs and scholarships from honest hard-working white men, but then ignore the demonstrable fact that resumes with 'white' names get significantly more callbacks. Humans love to simplify complex issues to black and white (heh), and The Red Pill is no exception.
The Reddit demographic is overwhelmingly young, white, and male, and TRP reflects that. Coming to TRP for race advice rarely works because you are addressing a population that largely has no understanding of or interest in your experience. White guys couldn't give less of a shit if minorities are getting laid. It's a lot fucking easier to yell out **#IndianRaceTroll** and enjoy all the sweet minority pussy riding the CC. Even if they did give a shit, they don't know what it's like to actually be a minority and deal with women, so all they can do is regurgitate the same vaguely condescending advice. ""Hmmm, have you tried being more Alpha??""
Look at all the hero worship /u/gaylubeoil gets...then remember that his advice to Asian men was to wait for Asian women to hit the wall then eat the superior Caucasian jizz out of their used up twats. Or this superstar whose sage wisdom was to just try being a .01% professional athlete. And of course there‚Äôs the ever popular advice to just casually make a shit ton of money, then buy a woman‚Äôs affection. It‚Äôs not BB without the BUCK$, right? That's the kind of bullshit 'advice' you're gonna get on TRP.
Stop waiting for some magic strategy that will finally unlock the secrets of pussy. If you want to get laid, you're gonna have to WORK. Don't let the echo chamber suck you in. Yes, you would probably do better with women if you were white, but you are who you are. You cannot change, only improve; but that is impossible so long as you remain in that ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù mindset. Your game will suffer for it, and women can smell that shit a mile away.
**2. Why Are White Men Preferred**
Just because you are a minority does not mean you are doomed to be incel. Just because you are white does not mean you automatically get laid. However, as members of TRP so thoughtfully remind us, the Western world and modern society was built by white men. (Thanks again guys we really appreciate it) Therefore the natural result is that society's default perspective is white. White men dominate business, government, and the media. Women don't prefer white men because they are superior physical specimens, they prefer them because white men represent STATUS. It's social conditioning. CEOs are white. Movie stars are white. Politicians are white. Who is brown? The garbagemen, the dishwashers, and the creeps on Facebook. In popular culture, white men represent the standard of attractiveness. Anything else is deviant and ultimately seen as inferior. **When you hear the name 'Chad Thundercock', the man you picture is inevitably WHITE.**
When we say women prefer white men we‚Äôre not saying that women choose pasty neckbeards over fit and confident minorities, we‚Äôre saying that society conditions us to both view Caucasian features as most attractive and Caucasian people as higher class. If height, facial symmetry, and physique are controlled, women will prefer the white man 9/10 times. And this mentality isn‚Äôt uniquely Western. Thanks to globalization and a history of colonialism, in many foreign countries (Latin America, Middle East, India, Asia) the most attractive members of society are those with the lightest skin and most European features, while the darker and more ethnic looking population is considered undesirable.
TRP constantly shits on women. They're children, they're immature, they're emotional. Yet somehow women are immune to the pervasive message of white superiority that permeates Western society. Women are incredibly susceptible to external influence, and right now that influence is that minorities are inferior. Indians shit in public. Asians have small dicks. Migrants are ruining America. Even our ROYALTY is fucking insane.
You're delusional if you think all of this has no effect on a woman's sexual preference, either consciously or subconsciously. And thanks to in-group/out-group bias YOU'RE FUCKED just because some piece of shit 10,000 miles away that vaguely resembles you doesn't know how to use a fucking toilet.
**3. Step Your Game Up**
At first this seems like the same ‚Äòbasic‚Äô advice I criticized earlier, but sexual success as a minority depends not only on a high SMV, but UNDERSTANDING why maximizing your SMV is critical. To get laid as a minority, your sexual game must be ruthless and preemptive. Your race is already a mark against you in her eyes. You can't afford to have any shortcomings because there's a white guy out there who doesn't and your little oneitis is constantly looking to upgrade. White boys can get away with being out of shape, or dressing poorly, or being a little boring. Not us. You need to be lifting, dressing sharp, perfecting your game, grooming yourself, and oozing sex appeal. This serves two purposes:
Firstly, this will determine if your race is actually what's holding you back. Too many times I see guys on TRP mention their 30% bodyfat then wondering if they're not getting laid because of their race. It's not the color of your skin, it's your manboobs and love handles. My fellow nationals love to give me shit for maintaining my physique and say things like ‚ÄúMiddle Eastern men aren‚Äôt supposed to work out‚Äù, then in the same breath complain that ‚Äòour women‚Äô always go for white and black guys. Get your fucking house in order before you play the race card.
Secondly, because women prefer white men you need to ensure that you are superior in other aspects in order to overcome that preference. If girls prefer white guys if things are equal, then make sure they‚Äôre NOT. He's 20% BF, you're 10%. His clothes are off the rack, yours are tailored to fit. His jokes are lame, while you're demolishing her shit tests.
Hypergamy rules all and it won't matter what race either of you are when you're the clearly superior choice. Coming out the gate hot and radiating sexual energy will set the tone for the whole interaction and keep you out the beta zone. By ‚Äúradiating energy‚Äù I mean being open and confident with your body, not hiding your sexual appetite, and perfecting your application of kino.
The only area where you don't have to be on top of your shit is income, and that's only because it'll weed out women looking for an easy BB.
**4. Kill Your Fetish**
BLONDE BIMBO BLONDE BIMBO BLONDE BIMBO
It's a fucking obsession for some of you. You know who you are. You guys want to bitch and moan about how girls only want white guys, then turn around and lust after WHITE GIRLS with even more restrictive criteria. Not only is the irony is lost on you, but that desperate thirst permeates your entire lives. It‚Äôs incredibly off-putting, and that‚Äôs just from reading the PMs some of you have sent me. I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine what talking to you in person must be like.
I'm not saying stay in your lane and only fuck girls within your race, but you need to really be honest with yourself about why you want some bleach blonde Barbie doll with fake titties. Are you trying to prove something? I could understand if it was a desire for white girls in general, but for many of you it‚Äôs this specific, outdated stereotype that‚Äôs no longer relevant. You‚Äôre like a 5‚Äô2‚Äù guy lusting after WNBA players from 1996.
It‚Äôs not enough that you want a white girl, she needs to be a rich Sorority Girl‚Ñ¢. That‚Äôs just as unrealistic as a white guy who wants an Arab girl with a thong under her hijab. Yeah they exist but they‚Äôre not fucking with you. Get rid of your fucking entitlement and be practical with your sexual interest. You lost the privilege of being choosy the second you decided to complain about your lack of options.
**5. Avoid Stereotypes**
High SMV women are always looking for reasons to disqualify you. This is doubly true for minority men. They have stereotypes in mind and they‚Äôre just waiting for you to confirm them. You must be vigilant. Watch your words and actions and defy their expectations. For example, I‚Äôm not even Muslim, but God forbid I ever speak in favor of ‚Äútraditional‚Äù or ‚Äúold-fashioned‚Äù relationships. Then I‚Äôm the backwards patriarchal misogynist who only likes circumcised women. No wonder the Middle East is a shithole. Substitute gang rape, daughter abortion, hood mentality, or Machismo as needed.
Law 38 **(Think as you like but Behave like others)** is especially vital. Obviously we have better things to do with our time than debating women, but when it comes to discussions about gender roles and relationships, white men have much more leeway in what opinions they can voice. Keep your head down when it comes to controversial topics unless you‚Äôre in a known, comfortable group. But also, referring to point 3, the higher your SMV the less you rock the boat. Think of the difference between ‚Äòcreepy‚Äô and ‚Äòfunny‚Äô.
This isn‚Äôt limited to conversations, but to all potential situations where you might be judged. If you‚Äôre Indian, don‚Äôt try chatting up girls on your way back from the gym or after a fragrant meal. If you're black, make sure you're well-read and informed on current events. If you‚Äôre Asian and a ‚Äògrower‚Äô, rethink those boxer swim shorts when you hit the beach. You know the stereotypes. Don‚Äôt give them weapons to use against you.
**6. Avoid conflict**
This is related to #5 but is so important it needs to be addressed on its own. When you as a minority go for a girl of a different race, people WILL give you shit. Mainly guys who feel they are above you on the ‚Äòhierarchy‚Äô of race (White&gt;Black/Hispanic&gt;Arab/Asian). Sure, you two might have shared a beer 10 minutes earlier, but now they see your girl, they like your girl, and they want your girl. In their minds they can convince her to ditch you and ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù, and THEY‚ÄôRE NOT WRONG. If you lose frame, that‚Äôs exactly what she‚Äôll do. If you get jealous, mate guard, lash out, or talk back, you play right into their hand. Especially if it‚Äôs a white guy banking on you being an angry minority. Obviously you have more leeway for an LTR, but not total immunity. A cool head must always prevail. Amused mastery is your friend. ""It‚Äôs 2015, I thought racism was dead."" Ideally your opponent will seem backwards and insecure instead of you.
The more subtle and insidious threat will be the people who try to shame you for not going after the girls of your own race. Fuck them. They‚Äôre either jealous guys or girls of your own race who want a soft BB landing when they fly off the carousel. Black women especially are pros at this (and all the Steve Harvey ""Think Like A Man"" bullshit from recent years has made it worse; watch them change their tune when they actually get some White attention), but even white girls get in on the action trying to shame white guys into staying away from Asian girls. Don‚Äôt engage them or try to debate them. I always say that I‚Äôll start dating Middle Eastern girls when they do the same, but even that I feel is too much.
**7 Embrace your culture‚Ä¶**
One tactic I‚Äôve seen for minorities is to bury their ethnicity, whitewash themselves, and try to blend in as much as possible. That is the equivalent of ab implants. On the small chance they‚Äôre not immediately ridiculed, they don‚Äôt hold up to any kind of close inspection. A minority who tries to ignore his looks or heritage performs a similar act of insecurity. We are not white and never will be. Don‚Äôt pretend otherwise. Women love pride and confidence. And trust me, there‚Äôs nothing better than boldly saying ‚ÄúI am X‚Äù with that strong sense of culture and history, especially when the random white guy next to you ‚Äúthinks his grandma was German, maybe‚Äù before trailing off mumbling something about 1/16th Cherokee.
Exception: The only people who can pull this off are minority guys who are half-white. Often times they have to 'pick a side'. Stay true to your roots, but play up the white aspects if you're trying to get girls. White girls will like you because you're exotic and different enough to be interesting but still white enough to not be alienating. Minority girls will like you because you allow them to satisfy their white hypergamy but you're still ethnic enough to not make them feel like they're selling out.
This is counterpoint to #5. Don‚Äôt be ‚Äòthe foreigner‚Äô, but know your history, culture, and where you came from; and don‚Äôt be shy if an appropriate opportunity comes up for you to discuss it. This leads into the next point. Embrace your heritage‚Ä¶
**8 ‚Ä¶But give them what they want**
White girls love war bonnets, dream catchers, moccasins, and those vaguely tribal designs they find on clothing at ‚Äúvintage‚Äù stores. But how many of them care to learn about Native American history or, God forbid, actually visit the rez? They love all the flashy accoutrement of foreign cultures (especially the food‚Ä¶) but care very little for cultural significance or respectful admiration. To them, appreciating another culture means appropriation and accessorizing. Think of how much women love ‚Äòtravel‚Äô and compare that to what they actually do while abroad. Spoiler: it‚Äôs the same fucking shit they do at home, just with a foreign filter and a smug sense of false worldliness.
When pursuing Western women, you need to give them a similar experience. I am North African. When I‚Äôm with girls and culture comes up all they care about are khamsas, mint tea, hookah, and belly dancing. That‚Äôs what appeals to them. And even then you can see their eyes glaze over and their hands twitch for their phones if I mention the history and significance of those things. They want superficial enjoyment without any deeper understanding. Don‚Äôt try to educate them, just sweep them up in the ride. I can take them to any shitty ahwa (Arabic caf√©) and they act like it‚Äôs something out of Arabian Nights. Figure out the equivalent for your race/ethnicity and learn how to present it, and make damn well sure you know the best place in town for [insert race here] food. With shining eyes they will look at you and profess how wonderful it is that you thought they were special enough to introduce to your culture. Try not to roll your eyes.
The question remains as to when to bust out these cultural big guns. Honestly, if you're at the point where you can take a girl to a bhangra show, tea ceremony, or cultural art exhibit, then you're pretty much already in. In fact, some of these things might be too intense for a first meetup. Rather, you want to dole out ethnic theatrics gradually. Unless culture was explicitly discussed and she expressed interest, you want the first date or two to be normal RP. Feel free to tease her about how awesome your culture is and that you might bring her around if she's cool enough. Don't dump it on her, allow her to 'explore'. Then throughout the relationship you can periodically ""include"" her in the ethnic activities. The point is to not make it a gimmick, but another tool in your arsenal.
Again, keep point #5 in mind. Don‚Äôt lay it on too thick or you‚Äôll be typecast. We are more than our ethnicity, all of us. Respect yourself as an individual. We defy stereotypes and racism because we refuse to allow others to define us solely by our race. Don‚Äôt do the same to yourself.
**9 Know your demographic**
This point seems antithetical to the rest of the guide, but the truth is that you are going to do better with certain women and certain scenarios versus others. It‚Äôs the concept of diminishing returns. Yes, you can and should go for any women you want, wherever you want, but if you want the biggest bang for your buck (pun intended) you‚Äôll know how to strategize.
9a: Location
For example, unless you are extraordinarily fit or good looking (top 5%), Tinder or online dating is not your best bet. Whereas the top 20% or so of white men can compete online, only the top 5% (Asian and Indian) and 10% (Latino and Black) can do the same. Online dating massively enables a woman‚Äôs hypergamy and there‚Äôs no point in her settling for you when a better option is a few swipes away. I had a white roommate who is shorter, chubbier, and less attractive than myself, but he matched with girls on Tinder FAR more often than I did. (Whether he actually closed is another thing entirely) However, if we walked into a party together he would be invisible. In real life, my confidence and swagger shine through in a way that isn't possible on a phone screen. While he was matching with girls every week, I was consistently picking up girls on the weekends. It‚Äôs all about context.
Similarly, for a minority a cold daygame approach is an uphill battle. Yeah we‚Äôve all seen the videos where the Asian PUA gets phone numbers, but how often do you think those girls text back? In my experience it‚Äôs not worth the time and effort unless you can establish some connection (ie not just talking to her on some random sidewalk) Your best bets are parties and social events, through your circle of friends, and clubs and group activities; basically any situation where you‚Äôre not judged solely on your looks. If you‚Äôre lifting and taking care of your appearance, girls will find you attractive, but these are situations where you can use your game, confidence, presence, and force of personality to overcome any hesitation a girl may have for your race. You know where I see Asian guys with white girls? I see them at house parties, hiking trails, and art museums. I don't see them at nightclubs or frat parties. Learn to work the venue.
Unsurprisingly, concerts and music festivals are also great place to find receptive girls. Once you bust out some sweet moves, that girl rolling won‚Äôt give a fuck what color you are.
9b: Geography
Not all areas are the same for picking up women. Obviously you should never uproot your life solely for women, but if you have the choice of locale or you're visiting then bear this in mind. Essentially, geography can be broken down into three areas: **climate, competition, and scarcity.**
**Climate:** Not the weather, but the vibe of the city and what the ideal is. If you're in Santa Barbara or another beach town and girls are running after blonde surfer beach boys then you're gonna have a bad time. Likewise if you're in the deep South and there's lingering racial tension. Compare those locations to a place like south Florida. Proximity to the Caribbean and multicultural demographics make it much friendlier for minorities.
**Competition:** Who are you running up against? In a world-class city like New York you're competing with the cream of the crop. Lawyers, brokers, Old Money, male models, etc. TRP advocates BECOMING one of those world-class men, but until you do so you're playing out of your league. Compare that to the Pacific Northwest (Seattle and Portland), crawling with politically correct SJW/BP beta guys. Frame and game will take you far.
**Scarcity:** Where the white women at? If you want a white girl, then find out where they are. Attractive white women are rare in San Francisco, and on top of that there are plenty of Asian and Indian guys to go around. Their value becomes hugely inflated. Compare that to the Midwest where pretty white girls are a dime a dozen.
9c: Race and Culture
The other factors to take into account are the race and culture of the girl you pursue. After a certain amount of time you will find out which girls are the most receptive to you, and act accordingly. For myself, if I put in the base amount of effort, I can close an attractive Latina or mixed girl, a decent white girl, and a below average Asian. So I tend to go for Hispanic/Black/mixed-race women, avoid Asian women entirely, and handle White women on a case-by-case basis. Therefore the overall quality of the women I date and my rate of success are significantly higher than if I approached all women equally. The farther away you are from a woman's 'racial ideal', the more she will shit test you. In her mind, you have to compensate for your race by being especially Alpha.
By 'culture' I mean the social situation and preference of the girl you pursue. This also depends on where you are meeting women. For example, white men dominate Hollywood, government, and business. The closer women are to those spheres, the more they are going to pursue and value white men. Likewise, look at black men in athletics, music, and entertainment. The same applies. Different scenes will have different standards. A ‚Äòcountry‚Äô girl might exclusively date white guys, while a girl who actually lived on a farm will be open to minorities. Distinctions are paramount. Girls who overly value ‚Äòimage‚Äô will take significantly more work.
9d: Breaking it down by race
What has been true in my experience. If you don't know where to look start here. Obviously not including girls of your own race.
**Black:** White girls blasting Childish Gambino and Drake, hip Asian girls on dance teams, and any Middle Eastern girl who isn't too religious. Seriously. Kim Kardashian isn't doing anything new. Arab girls LOVE black guys, anything to piss off baba.
**Indian:** Asian girls are receptive and Hispanic girls are down for the brown. Same color, different flavor.
**Middle Eastern:** Just like Indian guys, Hispanic girls are fair game. If you tend towards the white side (Lebanese, Armenian, Persian, etc.), then white girls are a viable option as long as you keep that SMV high. If you tend towards the black side (Moroccan, Egyptian, etc.), then black and mixed girls are gonna be all over you.
**Hispanic:** Keeping up that cultural exchange, middle eastern girls are great, especially if you're a good dancer. And like Arab guys, if you're whiter (Argentinian, from Jalisco, etc.) you can go after white girls and if you're blacker (Puerto Rican, Dominican, etc.) go after the black and mixed girls.
**Asian:** Nerdy white girls that read too much manga are usually down, along with black girls, as they represent the other low-SMV race for women and will welcome the attention. Besides that, the 'easy' way is to get really good at something then plow through girls in that area. The Asian guys I know that get hot (including white) girls are creative types (singer, dancer, artist, etc.) or talented athletes that are great at what they do.
If you‚Äôve been working on your SMV any girl is worth a shot. Don‚Äôt let this point dissuade you. Just be aware of the context within which you pursue any girl and decide if you‚Äôre making progress. Evaluating your interaction is a dynamic process. The key here is to not put the pussy on a pedestal. Sometimes for guys the idea of fucking the blonde sorority girl (#4) is more appealing than the actual act.
**10. The BlackPeopleTwitter Effect**
You ever check out the blackpeopletwitter subreddit? It‚Äôs filled with memes and jokes from the perspective of Black popular culture. But whenever there‚Äôs a post critical of white people or poking fun at them, you can guarantee the comments section blows up with slighted whites eager to defend themselves. Use that insecurity to your advantage. This is the biggest piece of actual strategy that wasn‚Äôt included in the original post. Turn the tables and tap into White guilt and fear of exclusion to neg girls and AMOG guys.
Be ruthless with white stereotypes. THEY‚ÄôRE LAME. They‚Äôre weird. They age like shit. They can‚Äôt dance. Their food is bland. White people put cucumber slices in water to make it less spicy. Call her out on her Ugg boots and Starbucks. Give that frat star shit about his Sperrys and button down. White people are dumb rednecks, boring and basic suburbians, or out-of-touch 1 percenters. They can‚Äôt win. If they try to get racial back then you use the liberal machine to your advantage, and make THEM look like the bad guys. When these white guys get pissy just call them autistic and throw out a line about them shooting the place up. Once you‚Äôve dominated them socially and physically just wait for the girls‚Äô war bride mentality to kick in and scoop them up.
The trick here is to be subtle with these comments. Aggressively opening with reverse racism is just going to exclude you more. Wait for an opening to present itself, and then strike. Anyone who‚Äôs spent any amount of time with white people can tell you those opportunities arise quickly and abundantly. A hard stare down and an eye roll will move mountains.
**11. NEVER DATE A RACE TRAITOR**
We all know these girls. Asian and Indian girls are the worst offenders. They are a liberal and 'educated' veneer over a damaged, self-hating core. **Race traitors are NOT simply girls who date outside their race.** Rather, they constantly talk shit about the men of their race, and systemically ignore them romantically, as they ride the carousel HARD until the wall hits and they‚Äôre forced to come crawling back to their ‚Äòculture‚Äô and carve out a cushy life for themselves with a BB husband and a dead bedroom. Throw in the secret orgy sex tape that hubby finds and the Reddit relationships post writes itself.
The hypocrisy is astounding. They talk about how men of their race are creepy losers, not realizing they‚Äôre shitting on their own brothers and fathers. Next time you hear an Indian girl talk about how Indian men are pussies, ask her if her sons are gonna be half or full-blooded pussy and watch her head explode. TRP does not advocate anger against women but if anyone deserves it it's these women. This might seem like a small point compared to the rest but the massive hypergamy of race traitors further skews the SMP, necessitating this guide. They're usually smart enough to at least not be single mothers by the time the wall hits, but they will **ALWAYS** find their BB.
If you keep working on your SMV and dating women, eventually these girls will come around. You're the perfect package. The AF they crave so much wrapped in a socially-acceptable same race package. They get to ride the carousel with no stigma. They're happy, their parents are happy, everyone wins...except you. DO NOT FALL FOR THEIR TRAP. They will work hard to rope you in and pretend they are the perfect package. Even if you ignore the whore past, the facade will inevitably crumble. Do not date them, do not marry them. They are only good for the pump and dump.
On the plus side, if you show up with a white girl on your arm, these minority girls will be the easiest fucking lays of your life and will pull the most sexually depraved shit to prove to you (and themselves) that her pussy is just as good as Stacey's.

16 THINGS CRUCIAL FOR NATTY LIFTERS - SCIENCE BASED + MY OWN EXPERIENCE,"  

Hello fellow TRPs,

First and foremost, I hope you all survived this quarantine shit and stayed in shape as much as you could. (:

Let's get 2 buissness. I will split this post into 2 parts. First part will focus on general stuff which I find most important on this journey. Second part will be focused on training plan itself and in depth exercise selection and execution.

GENERAL:

First and foremost, there are 3 key drivers of hypertrophy. 

Volume, intensity and mechanical tension. So, to simplfy it as much as I can, I will point out something that IMO is the key. Progressive overload. Progressive overload means that you should increase a certain variable depending on the goal (sets, reps...) over a period of time. Progressive overload could also mean that you reduce resting interval between sets of certain exercise if endurance is your main goal. A lot of people are stuck in a place because they dont keep track of their training. If you do not constantly expose your muscles to some greater degree of effort, muscle won't feel the need to adapt. Therefore, no hypertrophy. Progressive overload concept also means that you gradually increase weight. It means that you do not dwell on wat should I do today. It means that you have a solid training plan that you will stick 2. That brings me to my number tips. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. MAKE      YOURSELF A TRAINING PLAN YOU WILL STICK TO. Do not waste time in the gym.      This way, when you enter a gym you do not have doubts like what should I      do today. You have your goal which makes you more determined to complete. 
2. GET      YOURSELF LITTLE BLACK NOTEBOOK. This will be your reality check. People      who see me in the gym always see me carrying pen and little notebook.      Write down, each set, each rep, did you had any problems with execution of      some exercise...I usually write only working sets, not warm up sets. I      also write if I did let's say bench press and spotter was 'questionable'      and I think it helped me more than he should. Then I will write for      instance, 'Bench press 3. 120kgx3 (last rep spotter issue, don't progress      test next training). 
3. Try      to PROGRESS each training. My goal is a mix between strenght and      hypertrophy, thus we could call it powerbuilding. So, for my goal I can      change 3 variables. Set, rep, tempo. I usually do 3 sets per exercise. Let      me give you an example. My main chest movement is weighted dips. I'm doing      them in 3 sets per 6-8 reps. So I take weight I can do for 6 reps max,      lets say 20 kg. Then I progress untill I can do all 3 sets of 8 reps with      20 kg. After that I increase to let's say 22,5 kg and I want to make same      thing again, progress to 3x8 with that weight.
4. DITCH      THE JUNK VOLUME. My training philosophy in the last 2 years goes by less      is more. You want to stimulate the muscle the most in as less series as possible.      You do not need 25 sets for biceps as a natural. Key is as Lee Haney would      say 'to stimulate not to anihhilate'. Find exercises which suit you the      most (1,2 3 tops) for certain muscle group. Do lets say 3 sets of each and      progress on them. You can vary rep range, but key is to progress. Whether      is the biceps, legs or back, you need to go HEAVY atleast once in 2 weeks.      More of that in exercise selection. 
5. CONSIDERING      THE VOLUME in the workout, context is needed. Exercise selection is very      important. Stimulus to fatigue ratio is very specific. 3 series of heavy      incline bench will make you more fatigued than 3 series of chest flies.      When people ask me,'Okay Stipe, what is the ideal volume for me?', my      answer is always 'the one you can recover from'. If you are constantly      sore, you'r body is not handling the volume well enough, not recovering      properly and you should consider the volume, exercise selection and      execution. Practical guidlines would be that a person should aim to 4 to 8      hard sets per muscle group per training. You could do 16 sets in 1      training but everything above 8 could be considered as junk volume. If you      can still do hard sets late in the training, you didnt make heavy enough      those first 8 series. Since this is intermediate guide, another practical      point would be to split the volume in couple of days so muscle is fresh      and you can lift bigger weights each time, than you could after lets say 6      hard sets.There are 2 terms, MEV (Minimal effective volume) and MRV      (Maximal recoverable volume). To simplify as much as I could, you should      aim from 10 do 18 tops hard sets per muscle group, depending on your      level. Some research suggest up to 24 working sets tops. Each individual      is different, so explore your body and your capacity. 
6. INTENSITY.      This is something that goes in 2 ways. Old school and new school. Old      school would knew your 1 RM (1 rep max) and do like 80 percent of 1 RM      would be usually done per 5 reps. 80% of 1 RM x 5 reps. New school goes by      RPE scale (Reps in reserve). I am going by old school method, both are      great, wont spend much time on that (will post some links below). Example      of RPE scale would be if an exercise says RPE 8, it means you have 2 more      reps in tank 2 failure. With RPE scale you can autoregulate your training.      For instance because of the job or some other issue you dont have enough      strenght to complete what's planned for today in the book. Important thing      2 consider is that your sets should be CHALLENGING. 
7. ACCESORY      INTENSITY TECHNIQUE. Apart from classic drop sets, partials and superset I      use DC method, credit to Dante Trudel and DoggCrapp training. It's      basically doing hard set, taking 5 to 10 deep breaths and banging out a      couple of more reps.
8. CHECK      YOUR EGO. Egolifting is the modern disease. I dont give a fck if you can      lift 10000000000 kg on certain exercise if your form is shit. One of my      rules is triple S. Safety, stability and strenght. That means when      perfoming certain exericse, you should be safe while performing      (minimalising potentintial injuries threats), stable meaning that you      control the weight in certain pattern throught the whole movement without      widging, jumping side 2 side etc. And of course, you should be able to progress      on that exericse, get strong.
9. THERE      ARE NO SPECIAL EXERCISES. Each individual responds different to a certain      exercise. If Phil Heath does bench on bosu ball it doesn not mean you must      do bosu ball bench press. It depends on your goal, constitution, general      posture...Find ones which you feel most comfortable on. 
10. THERE      ARE NO SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTS. Supplements are not needed to have great      results. If you have sufficient protein intake, you do not need proteins      such as whey. I usually aim 2,2 grams of protein per kilogram. You should      take whey if you can't hit daily protein intake. I think that every lifter      especially intermediate could benefit of 5 grams of creatine per day (No      special benefit in charging and deload strategy). Coffein has some preworkout      benefits, I prefer coffee tho. 400 mgs is max you should go per day. BCAA,      EAA...Not needed. They can be somewhat usefull in endurance      sports.Glutamine? Not needed. MY SPECIAL TIPS which I got from Eugene Teo.      Best intra workout? Pommengranate juice. Increases vasodilatation, blood      flow etc. My fav preworkout? Coffee and some dark chocholate. There is no      such thing as anabolic window, it is advisable only that you take atleast      30 g of protein n 2 hours wingspan when you finished training. 
11. LEARN      ABOUT NUTRITION. Basically it comes down to caloric surplus or deficit.      Each diet works if you are in deficit. If not, any of them will not work.      When it comes 2 muscle gain, if you are intermediate I would recommend      classical bulk and deficit approach. But clean bulk would be more      optional.
12. BRACE.      Brace goes by the hand with stability. During each exercise, especally      compound ones (Bench press, squat , deadlift, military press, rows..), you      should keep your core tight. That means thinking of your core as a baloon which      you need to fill out with the air in all directions. 360, all around. If      you see that 1 part is filling less than than the other side, you can do      breathing exercise like laying on the floor, pputting finger on that part      and trying to push that finger out while breathing.
13. Tempo.      My usual tempo is 3-2-1, which means 3 seconds lowering eccentric phase, 2      seconds contraction in the peak position and controlled explosive      contraction back up.
14. REST      INTERVALS. If your goal is hypertrophy for most muscle groups, and      compound movements, rest between sets should be around 2 minutes. That is      confirmed by Brad Schoenfeld and Menno Henselmans. For arms and shoulders      I keep them shorter. I do shoulder accesories back to back like cable      laterals, and for arms I do 45 seconds rest intervals.
15. GET      JACKED IN 5 DAYS, GET ABS IN 3 DAYS. Fck that bullshit. Getting jacked is      a marathon, not a sprint. Always remember that. People usually as what do      you do for arms /chest/legs...They should ask for how long have you been      training?
16. Lastly,      noone cares who much you could bench when you were xy age. You want to      lift past 50's. Play the long game.",158,1

Get rich slow with the miracle of compound interest. 3 year update.,"Here is my previous [post] (https://www.forums.red/p/TheRedPill/4524/get_rich_slow_with_the_miracle_of_compound_interest/609286/) where I laid out my investing advice. Td;LR Get started asap and let it start growing early.

I wanted to show you guys it works and it is not just theory. A lot of you guys argued it would take too many years and why save for the future. It doesn't take long to start piling up as you can see blow. During this pandemic it's given me a lot of security and I haven't needed any of it so it will just keep snowballing. I'm only 33 but I'm already dreaming about retiring early and buying a boat to sail the Caribbean islands but that'll have to wait until the next update.

Here is my personal [graph](https://ibb.co/album/rkqYkg) and also a hypothetical 10k example showing its 45% growth over the last 3 years. I currently have 300k invested across all my accounts, of which is about 180k my contributions and 120k growth. A good rule of thumb is 300k is about halfway to a million due to future compounding. 

So that's all folks, get started investing and keep hitting the gym.",157,1

Why I did the right thing and not listened the advice on AskTrp (newbie learning by pain),"I posted a thread (now deleted) a few weeks ago about my ex-GF wanting to rebound with me. In my mind I could achieve great things as she was willing to do much to be with me. I wanted to meet other girls and her to be exclusive to me. Almost every guy trashed me for digging out the trash, I didn't listened as I could have a ""perfect"" relationship with a submissive hot caring girl AND have freedom to better myself.


Of course the majority of advice was right about not digging the trash, but I'm glad I did what I did so I could swallow the pill and stop being a bitch. If I didn't went on with this stupid idea I would always thought she was a great person and I was wrong about dumping her.


I told her I would only be with her in those conditions, and of course I could've convinced her better, but in any way she refused. Cried, fainted, etc.


12 hours pass and she sends me a message, I was toxic and blablabla, and she was for the past 3 months a cam whore, and said she was afraid to tell me. She send the link to her stream and I deleted right away. Well, guess what, I thought she was doing exactly that to get money... Well well;


The funniest things are:


* We literally didn't worked out because because prior to me she was a whore and lied about her past, causing me to forever have a *strange feeling about who she really was*

* She said that being a cam whore she met (online people I presume) that recognizes a real woman and *even pays for it!* It's funny how she honestly thinks she deserves money and being treated as a queen just by being a woman.

* Maybe if she was upfront about all, I wouldn't mind her milking money from incels and whatnot, I would not even bother being her pimp, but **she preferred lying to her ""perfect boyfriend""**



Bottom line: AWALT, RedPill is truth even if you don't want to take it, thrust your guts, don't stop learning, society is f'up, **don't be captain save a hoe**.",26,1
"7 days vacation, 40 approaches"," 

Hello guys. Me and my friend were on a vacation for 7 days and approached a number of around 40 women, mostly ones in a groups of two.

What we have concluded:

1. Bros over hoes 100%. It is common that sometimes men start to fight over some chick. Noone of them is worth fighting against eachother. You just show your life priorities, that you are optionless and that you find her as a prize you 2 are fighting for. ""Either both of us eat, or we do not eat at all.""
2. He who hesitates, masturbates. Hesitation is a killer. Action is the key. Stop overthinking about whether you will get denied or not. World goes on. What is the worst thing that can happen? ""No, we are not interested.."" And the world goes on. While you are blabbing about approaching, other Chad will take your woman in front of your eyes.
3. Be direct and straight forward abt your intentions, woman can smell shit miles away. Woman will rarely escalate for you. It is up to you to show her that you can initiate the action. Gor for that kiss man.
4. Good parfume is gamechanger. Joop is good choice.
5. Fashion accesories like a good watch and bracelet are also good cost benefit.
6. How not to be boring? Be interesting. How to be interesting? Be interested.
7. Woman will shittest your frame 24 7. Do not be scared. It is because they want to see your integrity. Embrace it and handle it like a man. Like a mountain.
8. Have fun and always be prepared to walk away.
9. If you are just a muscle head and you do not have the game, wittynes and vibe, you are donzo.
10. Don't be mad if you get flaked. It was always numbers game.
11. Real man should always have 2 condoms, pocket tissues and chewing gums.

EDIT: 40 approaches, 20 numbers closed. 10 orbiters seeking ones, 8 flakes. 2 lays by me, 2 by my friend. One girl from France and one from UK.",102,1
Advice to first time TRP Posters From Someone Who Wrote a Cringy first TRP post,"A few months back, I had wrote my first, admittedly cringy and wrong, TRP post ranting about how Tinder is a waste of time. While at the time my drunk mind thought it was a stroke of red pill brilliance, I quickly learned from the community's feedback how wrong I was. My post was deservedly deleted by the mods. For awhile, I stubbornly became disillusioned with the red pill. How could a community which I fundamentally agree with and whos forms I had been lurking for a couple years reject my ""wisdom""? Well, turns out the answer is found in one of TRP's fundamental pieces of advice; the same advice I would share with my past self and any of you frustrated lurkers  looking to share your enlightend wisdom for the first time...

STFU and lift!!

Its cliche advice at this point, but its a cliche for a reason. Lifting involves real work the bottom 80% won't do. Lifting makes you attractive. Having a sculpted body is a turn on for women who, for hundreds of thousands of years, relied on a physically strong male to protect them from the threats of the world. There are much better posts on here that speak to the benefits of lifting that I encourage you to search and read. My post here is not about the benefits of lifting, but about how lifting relates to first time posters.

There is not necessarily a causation to lifting and TRP wisdom. You might have incredibly wise and insightful advice as to dating, women, and the world while being incredibly out of shape. But there is a correlation. 

My post was about how Tinder sucks and is a waste of time. After it was rejected by this community, I began to reflect on why it was rejected. I decided to go back to the basics of TRP and assess myself in terms of the value I provide to women sexually. And what I was forced to accept was that I was not sexually desireable.

Since that post and my reflection on it, I began to lift regularly. While I don't yet have the physique of a Greek god, I have recently gone back to Tinder and online dating from which I now have three consistent plates that I've laid and am currently spinning, as well as many more prospects. 

This is only my 2nd post here and will be my last post for a long while if not forever as, frankly, it's nothing new. I am putting this here as a reality check for those of you considering posting here for the first time who, like me at the time, have not practiced TRP's most fundamental piece of advice. You cannot rant about the sexual marketplace if you have not done everything you can to become as desirable as possible in it. The tools to do so are here in this form. So read, train, and listen to the wisdom already here. I bet 99% of you here who do, if you do, will find you have no need to post after you put into practice the wisdom already here.",5,1

**Intro**

In a nutshell, this post is me reaching out to a mostly silent percentage or at least what I think is a minority of dudes who browse this sub. I‚Äôve seen a number of dudes speak out for virtues, trying to build a better society, family, etc. Personally, I agree with all of that. I think that losing sight of what our ancestors learned about the world and life is only playing into the blue pill narrative and in effect detrimental to us a s individuals. But then the question is:

**What exactly is the Red Pill and what does it stand for?**

That‚Äôs a loaded question, because the term ‚Äúred pill‚Äù didn‚Äôt originate from this sub in the way that we see it. It obviously came from the movie ‚ÄôThe Matrix‚Äô but other communities have used the term ‚Äúred pill‚Äù for any sort of rude awakening loooong before we did. But in terms of our sub, TRP is basically a reactionary movement to the vaginal society surrounding us nowadays. That‚Äôs easy.

In terms of what this sub stands for‚Ä¶ I honestly don‚Äôt even know. Let‚Äôs take the sub‚Äôs description:

&gt;‚ÄúThe Red Pill: Discussion of sexual strategy in a culture increasingly lacking a positive identity for men.‚Äù

So on the surface, TRP seems to be just about sex and how to get it. However, TRP seems to adapt post by post. In a post that‚Äôs about getting pussy, everyone will say that TRP isn‚Äôt just about getting poon and that it‚Äôs about getting better as a man. And yet, a few posts down the home page, one that has to do with building a foundation in society or maybe denouncing promiscous sex is seen with the claim that TRP is only a sexual strategy and that you don‚Äôt owe anyone shit and ‚Äújust enjoy the decline, bro!‚Äù

I‚Äôll take the sub‚Äôs description at its word and see it as a sexual strategy guide for the sake of consitency. However, this is where my conflict with TRP begins. If this were just a sexual strategy club, why wouldn‚Äôt I just turn over to a PUA sub? What difference is there between endlessly chasing pussy and the other simpletons that chase sex for the rest of their lives? You don‚Äôt need any of this shit to get laid; plenty of degenerates don‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt even need to work hard. Put yourself in a club scene for a year, be a social, chill dude and you‚Äôll get laid like a king.

But the even bigger issue I have is the pervasive nihilism/cynicism that is in this sub. There‚Äôs this implied assumption that if you say ‚Äúfuck society‚Äù and just put your dick in wet holes you‚Äôre somehow better off. In my mind, you‚Äôre playing right into the enemy‚Äôs hand you so despise. Society \*wants\* you dumbed down by mindless sex and drugs and consumerism. You‚Äôre the same as the other hoardes of robots that also live for that stuff. Everybody else is having sex, you just have an advantage on your side (to put it very kindly). That‚Äôs the only difference. TRP tries to wake you up from the matrix by giving you the rules of the matrix. You‚Äôre still playing by its rules.

If this is what you want, fine. But be honest about it. You‚Äôre doing what everybody else is doing, albeit in a larger frequency.

**Looking Beyond Just Pussy**

Men have built civilizations. They‚Äôve followed religion to build families and philosophy in the pursuit of knowledge. They‚Äôve fought for what they believed in. I believe the concept of the Red Pill goes WAY, WAAY beyond women. If TRP were an iceberg, women would be the clouds up top. They‚Äôre not even in the iceberg. Women are entry level red pills to what the world really is.

The concept of The Red Pill to me is *reality at its purest*. At least, what we can interpret from it with our human brains. It‚Äôs philosophy, finding out about a *higher truth*. It‚Äôs about the search for enlightment through meditation. It‚Äôs giving to the world as a leader rather than being a taker. Looking out for the tribe. Following our instincts to create but at the same time, having a handle on your primal urges. It‚Äôs about finding the right balance between selfishness for your own well-being and selflessness to be able to provide value into the world. The most nihilistic TRPers would have you believe that someone like Marcus Aurelius, a fucking Roman emperor who served valiantly, is blue pilled because he denounces promiscuous sex. Right.

**The Truth is The Red Pill**

This, in my opinion, is what the concept of TRP is: That the truth will bring you to happiness. If you‚Äôre happy in life by just getting your dick sucked, I honestly envy you. More power to you. However, I‚Äôm trying to reach out to the guys that maybe feel the same way I do. I know they‚Äôre here because I‚Äôve seen them, but I just wanna raise a voice to that.

What I wish is that there was a group of men that had this same pursuit in mind. I honestly don‚Äôt know of any sub like that (r / self-improvement) has the right idea, but it still works under a blue pill paradigm). A pursuit to emulate what our ancenstors did in order to reach a higher state of mind. We might be too small of a group to build a new society but there‚Äôs nothing stopping us from living through those ideals. The core idea is this: a group of men that follow the principles of TRP to bring value into the world while rejecting nihilism, marxism, hedonism and any other ideology that doesn‚Äôt bring any value into the world.

Hope I struck a chord with some of you guys. Peace and take care, fuckos.",212,1

Developing your personality when raised in a single mother household (boyhood to manhood),"The following is a train of thought and conclusion written to try to understand the struggles of my and possibly other men‚Äôs fundamental issue when transitioning from boyhood to manhood when you were raised in a single mother household.

Most people‚Äôs personalities it seems is a conglomerate of social communication patterns learned by their environment socially, paternally, and maternally. 

It seems that my (a male being raised in a single mother household that moved around a lot in adolescence) personality is missing the socially and paternally so I have a originally maternal personality slowly being entrenched into logic and truth through my study of philosophy and truth which is a bottom up approach to paternal order and personality. 

Through this I have developed my own type of personality unique to myself and distinct from my social environment and counter to my maternal personality. To become balanced I must learn to empower my paternal side while lowering my maternal side while still enabling it to thrive when possible and necessary. Through this I might not be able to ever really engage in the social aspect of life successfully or at least to the same level as those raised in a two parent household. 

However, it does mean if successful in extending my studies to gain a meaningful and purposeful perspective of truth and logic, i can (emphasis on can, not will) become a great leader of truth and love in a way no one in my social environment has seen before.

TLDR: when raised without the paternal example, you develop a unique one to fit your goals, this creates a unique personality that will be uncommon amongst your peers, but can ultimately still be useful for your life and society at large.",13,1

Sex drive gone during a cut?,"(21, male) hey trp, I have been cutting for a couple months now for my fitness. I was never fat to begin with but I'm going for the full 6-pack look. I've dropped 20 pounds, and I plan on dropping 10 more and then bulking for the winter. 

But my sex drive is gone! It's crazy. I used to get a hard on walking into walls. Now I'd rather eat a burger than fuck a 10. It's insane.
Now, I can still get it up but I just have roughly 0 desire to do anything pursuit of women right now.

Is this normal?

Besides having no libido im about as optimally healthy as one could hope to be - I eat healthy, workout almost everyday, have a decent social life, two businesses, I'm ambitious, I regularly attract girls, etc...and I'm sure that when I bulk up again I will be more 'horny'
Another thing...I don't know if this is a factor or not, but like I said I work on two businesses from like 8-6 everyday except Sunday. So, my mind is much more there &amp; about building an empire than spilling my limited energy/time into a slut. Idk if that is also biologically affecting my libido.
Any help from fellow fitness-minded TRPers greatly appreciated.",9,1
Portrayals of hypergamy in fictional media.,"Ever since this pandemic started and bars/nightclubs have been shutdown, I've been consuming a lot more media and I've noticed some funny shit. Mainly that fictional TV Show/Movie writers show completely unrealistic portrayals of hypergamy.

Let's take The Flash for example. On this show, after Iris finds out Barry is The Flash, she's still hesitant to start up a relationship with him and still cares and loves for Eddie Thawne, a human with no powers whatsoever.

If a man like The Flash were on Earth... almost every woman in the world would KILL to be with him. Yet in the show, when he finally lands her, they have issues in their relationship from time to time.

Another example. Superman. Lois Lane still prefers to follow her career instead of settling down, giving birth to, and raising Super children.

If you guys ever watch drug trafficking movies, notice how the Colombian drug lord has a completely submissive wife. She never talks back to him or gives him shit tests because she knows he wouldn't put up with that shit and might even have her killed. Now that is an accurate portrayal of how a woman behaves with a man that has real power. And they're usually written accurately because that shit actually goes on in the world.

Yet, when it comes to fictional media like superheroes, these guys get treated like betas by the writers. You have Peter Parker groveling and trying to apologize to Mary Jane for trying to save motherfuckers from a mugging. You get Lois Lane complaining to Clark about not spending enough time with her and not spending so much time trying to stop planes from crashing.

It's ridiculous and if powers were ever a real thing, women would not violate their own hypergamy.",12,1

Never Let a Woman See You Bleed.,"**tldr; She doesn't want to see you weak. She doesn't want to hear you bitch. Be a closed book about your weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Learn to shut the flying fuck up.**


#Introduction:
I‚Äôm seeing an awful lot of mainstream advice telling men to ""open up"" to women and be ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù and unafraid to appear ‚Äúweak‚Äù around her. 

Do not listen to this advice, I repeat, **do not listen to this advice.** You will fuck yourself over so fast it's not even funny.

#Body:
You remember Briffault‚Äôs Law? 

*Briffault‚Äôs Law: The female, not the male, determines all the conditions of the animal family.* **Where the female can derive no benefit from association with the male, no such association takes place.** 

Think about the following for a second: What's the benefit of associating with a weak man? What's the benefit of associating with a man that's ""vulnerable"" and ""pours his heart out"" to her?

Newsflash: She doesn‚Äôt care about you, your problems, or your existential angst, she only cares about *what you can do for her.* If you do something that lowers your possible use in her eyes or something out of the ordinary which changes her perception of your utility for the worse, you fucked up. 

*B-b-but Scepter! Something tragic happened to me! I need to vent, I need to unwind!* 

If you need to ugly cry, go to your room, lock the door, and let that shit out. If you merely need to vent or rant, hit up a dude you trust or take out your journal and write away.

Women are incapable of seeing a man at his worst because it‚Äôs biologically disadvantageous to see a weak man and *approve* of it. Imagine being a female ape seeing a weak male ape with a defeated posture. You really think that female ape is gonna fuck that beta ape? Hell no, she‚Äôs gonna fuck the big strong gorilla a few paces away beating his chest because he looks *useful*.  

No woman on planet earth has ever said the following: 
 
‚ÄúGod, that man over there crying his eyes out because his father died is so fucking hot. I‚Äôm gonna suck his dick and swallow his children.‚Äù

Or 

‚ÄúBabe, I love it when you bitch and complain about work. It turns me on. Fuck me in the ass.‚Äù

When you actually apply this concept and refuse to show a weak emotion and stop bitching you will get tested like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. For example, I was on a date and the woman said seemingly out of nowhere...

‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm your enemy, do you even like me? You never tell me anything...""

I pulled her close to me and kissed her on the forehead. She eased up and latched on to me like a lost child. The silence and stoicism intimidated her so much that she ate up the affection like a fat bitch eating cake. 

She did it again later. 

""Why do you have your walls up? Why are you acting strange? What's going on?"" 

I smiled and hugged her tightly. She hugged me back as tightly as possible, so tight it was hard to breathe. Crisis averted twice without saying a word. 

The worst thing you could do when tested like this is backtrack and begin opening up to a woman and showing your ‚Äúvulnerable side.‚Äù In doing so you expose your weak frame AND let her know your weaknesses.  


#Takeaways:

- If you‚Äôre going through something tragic, go take care of your shit away from your women. Don‚Äôt let them see you weak. They will remember it and it will change their perception of you for the worst. 

- When tested for being too ‚Äúcold‚Äù or ‚Äúdistant‚Äù be sure to give them physical affection. Anything else will be questioned and doubted. 

- Do not show your ‚Äúvulnerable side‚Äù even if she asks you to.

**Never let her see you bleed.**

RUN THE PROGRAM,"Lecture from an old man (67m)-

YOU are the result of the hard work and breeding of all the men that came before you, your father, your father's father and all your ancestors.  I am old enough now that I can see the prime directive.  You are driven by a program.  That program is: **to spread your DNA as far and as wide as you can.**  Your children will be more important than anything else you do.

Everything that you are interested in is not really that important.  What really mattered is that your DNA did not die with you.  Your DNA must continue to live after you are gone.  You owe it to your fathers.

Go forth and fuck the young women!  Your time is more limited than you think.  Just do it.  Many are on birth control and many will abort your babies.  But some will live and that was your prime directive, to replicate your DNA.  As I drift into the history books I leave 4 children.  2 by a wife and 2 by a unmarried girlfriend.  After I am gone those 4 children will be the most important thing I leave behind, my DNA.  All the patents, all the money, all the airplane design and development work mean nothing.  The mountains I climbed, nothing.  When I die all that mattered is that the DNA lived on-",94,1

Stop Falling Into Women's Frames,"Earlier this week a message popped up that deeply irritated me. ""Yeah your game is good, but you succeed because you are good looking. Girls don't like guys that aren't good looking.""

This got me thinking: why would someone even look at the world this way? In short, WHO GIVES A SHIT what women think. Good looking vs bad looking? These are just female frames that you are falling into. You are allowing her to define reality and you are qualifying yourself by her standards. In essence, you are letting her take a relative concept (attractiveness) and define it for you. You are adopting her frame. Just the action of allowing her to do this will permit her to expand her ability to define 'attractiveness.' Her standards will go up and up. An 'attractive' guy from last week will be 'unattractive' now. Ironically, the more she gains this power to define your frame, the more she will lose attraction to you. Why would allow someone who likely has poor character to define your reality for you?

As you speak with your girl friends or female family members, notice how often they attempt to set the frame for the conversation. Like a glitch in the matrix, you will begin to notice how often the conversation happens on terms that prioritise their framing. Whether it's about how pretty she is, whether someone is attractive/unattractive, how you were rude, etc. etc. she will constantly be framing the conversation in her best interests. Women seem to do this naturally, so I don't know why men contribute to it. Even subtle things like body language can be a way she frames it.

One aspect that defines a man is his ability to set his own frame. Whenever you catch her doing this, define it for yourself.",71,1

How I kissed a girl in an hour from cold approach (Power of Kino and Persisting ),"I have been cold approaching for a couple months now and was sarging hard at outdoor shopping malls this summer with two of my wings. I have gone from having a lot of anxiety just talking to girls to being to approach any set anywhere I go. If you struggle with approach anxiety you just need to get rejected more and realize that it doesn't fucking matter. Anyways, I was flying back to college the other day and went to the airport a few hours early. I was looking for a place to grab some food and found a place that had food and beer. As I was walking towards the counter, I saw a cute brunette HB8 sitting alone on the phone with a beer. I decided to open the set and went indirect by asking about the beer she was drinking. She opened up but seemed more neutral in her expressions. We talked for a minute about her beer and I decided to grab one too. I came back and sat next to her and asked her what she's doing at the airport. She said she missed her flight and her next flight wasn't until a few hours later. I told her that I'm early for my flight and just chilling at the airport. I asked her where she's from and she told me she's from France and I pointed out that she did have a slight accent. She asked me what I was doing in the area and started asking me more personal questions. Once she opened up I decided to do some slight negs - We were talking about drinking and bars and I said ""You look a little wild."" and she laughed. When a set hooks and the girl gives you an IOI by asking you a personal question it's always good to neg/tease her a bit and try to slightly break rapport. This will get her to chase you and introduce a bad boy frame. After that, she started showing me pictures of her at the beach on her phone and I pointed out that her hair color was different. She began explaining how she dies it sometimes and this is where I decided to start kino. Kino is very important in a set because it establishes the man to woman frame and will actually let you know if she's is attracted to you. In Bang, Roosh says that a girl will talk to you, go on a date with you, etc. even if she isn't attracted to you - the only way to find out is by doing kino and seeing what her reaction is. When she was talking about her hair, I started brushing it with my hand and feeling it. She didn't react at all and continued talking which was a good sign. At this point, she got another beer and we continued talking for a bit. I decided to introduce a second kino move and pay attention because this one is very crucial. I told her that when I was younger, my mom taught me how to read people's palms. I told her that I want to read her palm and find out more about her. She laughed and gave me her hand. When she gave me her hand I put my left hand under her hand and used my right hand to trace the lines on her palms. I basically used the conversation to tell her 2-3 things about herself (Ex. You're an outgoing person, etc.) I wanted to introduce certain feelings in her that would make her more open to me. The last thing I told her was that ""You are going to meet a very cool guy and went on to describe myself"". I know it's a bit cheesy but Roosh talks about this kino routine in Bang and it works very well. I also made heavy eye contact while doing it. After this I wanted to escalate further and said ""Let's go on an adventure and walk around"". She agreed and we walked around the airport (I wanted to find a more isolated spot where I could do more kino). I brought her to a booth and we sat next to each other. I did another routine where we played a staring game and the first person to blink loses. She lost and jokingly said ""Is this that game where you have to kiss me?"" I joked back and said ""I don't know but now you're giving me ideas"". During this whole time I was doing light kino by touching her arm, etc. I told her ""Now I have to kiss you"" and we started kissing and making out. Unfortunately, I could not escalate further because of logistics but my goal wasn't to get the lay - I just wanted to escalate as much as possible in a tough set and gain experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

I learned that there were many things I did in the set that turned from lukewarm to hot. Here are some tips that might be helpful when you're working a set:

&amp;#x200B;

1. When the set hooks, and the girl gives you an IOI, don't be afraid to break rapport a little bit by negging or teasing her. Game is ultimately a push/pull and when she pulls in you want to push a bit by showing that you're not afraid to lose her. This shows abundance and DGAF and will get her chasing you.
2. Routines can be very effective for introducing kino in a set. Kino is crucial because it establishes a man to woman frame and creates sexual tension. Use the fake palm read, staring game routines because they are calibrated and easy to introduce in a set. 
3. Escalation doesn't necessarily mean kino and venue changing is very important to escalate in a set. Roosh talks about how this makes the girl feel like she has known you longer and gets her invested as it is a compliance test. 
4. You can use certain words that will trigger sexual feeling and make her more open to you. For example, in the set I used the word ""adventure"" to get her to feel more open and spontaneous. Other words that come to mind are ""explore, spontaneous, etc."" 
5. After you've done your first kino attempt gauge her reaction - If she reacts well make sure to continue doing light kino throughout the set - touch her arm, brush her hair, etc. This maintains a sexual frame and makes it easier to go for the kiss or the lay later on. 
6. When you've opened the set and t she asks you questions, use this time to drop some subtle DHVs. Talk about your hobbies, travel etc. (Roosh calls this dropping bait). This is your chance to paint a picture of yourself and the more attractive it is the more interested she will be. Storytelling is also very important and if you are able to tell stories that convey DHVs that is very powerful.

"Feel Good Story Of The Day, Example Of Redpill In Action",""" **Boyfriend is leaving me because I‚Äôm overweight.** ""

I should end this right here. This is gold. What a move. Great job holding your woman to a standard, king. 

This girl was living with her boyfriend during quarantine and I think had the wrong read on her dude. The story continues from there: 

"" *Admittedly before quarantine I used to go to the gym regularly and I was very fit* ""

Then what happened? 

"" *After quarantine I think I got too comfortable and I just started overeating and not doing any exercise. I gain weight terribly fast so I‚Äôve easily gained about +44 pounds.* ""

44 fucking pounds? In like 4 months? That's amazing. I'm surprised this guy stuck around as long as he did. 

"" *When I had gained about 22 pounds my boyfriend started commenting on how we should start eating healthier* ""

See, you don't have to be an asshole about your rules. The boyfriend here, although a little bit too late (22 pounds gained lmao) 'suggests' that his girl starts eating healthier. This is a nudge. If your girl is in the proper state (ie not comfortable) that should be all it takes to get her radar going and have her behaviour change. She was comfortable. She did not start eating healthier. 

"" *I saw the change in our sex life, he didn‚Äôt even want to cuddle and he started acting very cold. He wouldn‚Äôt even kiss me.When I‚Äôd insinuate to sex he would act like he was tired or not in the mood, I chose to believe him and didn‚Äôt think twice of it.* ""

He gave her another warning. He's being nice here, which I wouldn't, but again, giving her the warnings. She's just a dumb bitch who chose not to notice it, again, because she was comfortable. (Also, as an aside, people like fucking people they like. If your girl is suddenly 'not in the mood', it's not because she actually has a tummy ache. Take that as a huge warning sign.)

Ok, enough of my rambling, lets get to the good part:

"" *Well, today we were watching some TV I was eating some chips and he sat on the couch next to where I was sitting. He turns off the show, gets up and says : ‚ÄòWould you stop eating for fucks sake don‚Äôt you see your self in the mirror?‚Äô* ""

Oh. My. God. HAHAHAHAHAHA. You know what? I bet she got really horny when he did that. 

"" *I immediately start tearing up but he continued. He didn‚Äôt yell, he just stood there and calmly explained to me how he had no physical attraction to me anymore and my unhealthy lifestyle disgusted him.* ""

"" *He said that if I didn‚Äôt get my shit together he‚Äôd be gone,* ""

"" *I told him to get out and leave already if he‚Äôs disgusted by me. He actually left the room and packed his things.* ""

"" *Before he left he told me to think about what he said wether (sic) I chose to be with him or not.* ""

"" **I can‚Äôt stop crying and I need advice and for someone to explain what the fuck just happened right now.**  "" 

\- Honey, you got fat, and your man isn't some dweeb who think he'll never be able to get another girl if he leaves his current one, that's what happened. 

Lessons? There's a few. I think the main lesson here is that this guy definitely did things poorly before he did things right. His poor start though necessitated his strong finish. Had he, at the outset of the relationship, made it very clear that weight gain was a deal breaker, than he may not have had to go to the nukes on this one. I feel he started passively aggressively tried to start 'enforcing' a weight gain rule his girl wasn't aware he had after she had already gained 22 pounds. That's way too late. If he had done the 'lets eat healthier' thing when she had gained 10 pounds, then it might have worked. Of course, as I said earlier, if he had at the outset that weight gain was an issue, it may never come up as an issue, because the girl is aware of it. 

Still, he probably actually loves this girl so he let it slide until it hit 22. Then when she didn't change her behaviour he let her know he did not like it by withdrawing sex. Good move. But I may have been more of an asshole and let her know that the lack of sex had to do with the weight gain. In fact I would have made that very clear. But overall a fine play. 

The dumb bitch just didn't get it and kept eating. Here we see the nuclear option, IMO, deployed fairly well. I just think if you vet your girls and make your rules clear from the beginning, you can avoid having to go nuclear in the first place. But if you do have to go there, by all means, go there. 

The best part of his nuclear game was that he wasn't making an empty threat. She tells him if he feels that way he can leave, and he immediately goes and packs up and leaves. There is no negotiating or apologizing. That's why the move had power: it feels real. If he had made the threat and not then gone and immediately packed, this bitch would be hitting 66 pounds gained soon. 

So good girl management at the start of a relationship is essential to avoid this pitfalls, but if you find yourself in these pitfalls, do what this dude did (eventually). Bring it up, and make the future of the relationship dependent on whether or not the girl lives up to your expectations. 

And this shit works vice versa too, guys. Comfort equals death. If you're comfortable around your girl, she's bored. If she's bored, she isn't happy. Make your girlfriend uncomfortable about the security of the relationship, and she will behave better.",80,1
"Learn that everything you do has monetary value, whether or not that's stated outright","**Intro**

I think this concept is the fundamental key of learning to navigate the world. There's an old saying: there's only two currencies--your time, and money. I'd like to rebut that. To me, there's only two currencies: but it's your time and your skills, which can be used to exchange value in any way you see fit. 

**Why I Use Money As The Currency of Discussion**

The world operates on money. You exchange it for goods. You use it for influence. You can pay bail. You can bribe. People will be friendly to you to try to get it, or get from you the connections to get it themselves. Your home costs money. Your car costs money. In reality the only true value is in exchange, but money is the primary medium for that. But realize everything else can be valued that way too.

**What do I mean?**

Let's look at things that don't require money but can provide value as well. One area that leaps out to me is high SMV (looks, charisma, etc)--also using that example because this is a sexual strategy sub, and y'all will relate to it.

You will never be outright paid for your SMV. Therefore, it's monetarily useless to max it out, right? Yeah, maybe a simpleton may think that. But let's take a look at two hypothetical guys.

Guy A: Low SMV, only works hard on school and in his career, but is actually brilliant. He averages earning 200k throughout his life. He's a tech guy. Let's say he works 30 years making that. 30x 200k means this guy makes 6 million pre-taxes, maybe 4 million post-taxes give or take.

Now let's take this guy who makes 4 million dollars in his life and assign him a woman. Well, his SMV is dog shit, so despite being a high-earning tech guy, he can choose (let's say) a HB8 woman who makes $30k per year on average and mostly doesn't work. Mostly is a gold digger. Or he can choose a HB4 who makes $50k on average over 30 years.

Let's just say he picks the uglier girl who makes more. Let's say that adds roughly a million to his 4, bringing him to 5. Ignore that he's already made a trade-off in value that effects his quality of life (and that him working to make 200k/year likely means high stress &amp; high working hours--another trade-off that can be viewed monetarily). So he's got 5 million dollars total household net worth.

Alright, like I said, this man sucks at dating because he didn't value that. So he gets divorced. That means these assets get split. That 5 million he ever made? That's now 2.5 million for him lifetime. His SMV is dog shit, like I said, so he won't have another potential female to contribute to his 2.5 million--that's it for him. 2.5 mill. And he made 200k per year. Keep that figure in mind.

Now, let's look at Guy B. 

Guy B: This guy isn't that interested in being a ""career dude."" He's as smart as Guy A, but he doesn't want to work himself to death. He wants fun. He's exciting. He maxes out his SMV. He's got his charisma down to a T. He uses that to make 100k per year on average for his 30 years. Again, take taxes out, and let's say this man earns 2 million lifetime.

But this guy is a socially savvy, Chad-like guy. He can pick his woman among nearly anyone. When he's 30 and Guy A is 50, he meets Beta Guy A's 24 y/o daughter. Because Guy A's household (even though he no longer has access to it) earned pretty high, Guy A can still leave some money to his daughter. Let's say he leaves that million dollar home he purchased back when he made 200k (or his wife leaves it to her, since it's hers now). Let's just say in this example Guy A did marry that HB8 rather than the HB4, so the daughter is also a HB8. His daughter was raised well, so she makes 70k/year (since women still tend to earn less than men). Across 30 years that's 2.1 million, minus taxes we'll say 1.5 million. Plus a million dollars inheritance. You've got 3.1 million now.

3.1 million + 2 million = 5.1 million, and these people don't divorce because the man is Chad and the woman's SMV declines, not allowing her hypergamy to land her a better mate than the one she attracted at 24. So he comes out ahead by 2.6 million, and because he's so Chad-like, that full 5.1 million is under his sphere of influence. Unlike Guy A, who had he not divorced his wife, would still probably have to submit to her wishes to spend their respective 5 million.

Basically, Guy B worked half as hard, earned half as much, and walked away with *double*. People truly do not understand the importance of good mate selection. What if Guy B used his Chad-ness to attract a heiress to a fortune? A perfect 10/10 (non-monetary benefit)? He can trade that advantage he has in the SMP as he likes, but it manifests monetarily regardless. 

**Why Am I Saying This?**

I think people tend to think: net worth = income. That is patently false. Net worth accrues many ways. Smart investments, smart partnerships (LTR), managing money well without overspending, etc. 

Personally, I want to live my life. I'm only here once. You could not pay me an infinite amount to work 80 hour weeks. While you get money, what I lose I consider to be more valuable than the money I could not spend while working that. I am not saying do not try to earn money. Definitely do. But realize that net worth--which is what you're truly aiming for, not high income--is a result of good planning in all facets of your life, not just an income. You can finish ahead of Doctors and the like by playing the game well, without working nearly as hard as them. Work smart--not hard.

Secondly, for those that plan to marry or have kids, I used the LTR example precisely for you. Realize that all of your work you ever do is on the line when you marry. It can make or break you. If you choose perfectly and have every option possible, you don't need to truly work in the traditional sense that much, and you come out a winner. If you work and earn tons of money but choose poorly for marriage, you still end up in the shitter. Your LTR is legitimately the biggest financial risk/reward commitment of your life. It can definitely bolster you a lot with the right woman. But it can also hurt you tremendously.

**Conclusion**

Ensure that you place the correct value on everything you do. Working 60-80 hour weeks throughout your 20s? Realize what you're losing--you'll never get that time back. You could build your skills and get paid more efficiently, losing less time in the trade-off for money. For example owning a business may cost an upfront amount of time for 3-5 years, but if successful, you can now work much less and still reap rewards. 

Realize that there's more and less ideal types of work. For me, working on SMV and women is fun. And it yields benefits. Monetary benefits. I'd rather go game girls and find a girl like the one Guy B gets than spend my time grinding in a corporate setting like Guy A does. If you love your work, it's easier to excel in it. Maybe some people like whatever job they do and want to spend all their precious time on Earth doing that. Maybe you don't but still want the money associated. This is to say that that's possible. 

Finally, realize that it's still impossible to get something for nothing. Your two available currencies are time and skills. You've got a set amount of time--on average, about 20-40 years of work with an average being likely close to 30-35. And within that, you can use more or less of that time working--but you've still just got those years. However, you can build any skills you want and profit off of them. What you cannot do is profit a high amount off of few skills. If you don't have skills, you will need to use a lot of time to profit a lot. That's why skill-building is imperative. But again, that skill can be in anything that people will pay to access. For some, that's tech. For some, that's sales. For some, that's teaching. For some, people will pay to date you. For some, you can be profit off of investments. For some, it's being born to your parents. There's money in everything. Find out how to access it. Expand your view beyond the traditional income = net worth mindset, and capitalize on all opportunities that come your way.

Low time and low skills = low pay. High time and low skills = moderate pay. Low time and high skills = moderate pay. High time and high skills = highest pay. Use your time and skills wisely. There's a lot to do out there in the world, and we only live once.

Request for any good Redpill books that are good for getting through a bad breakup and rebuilding?,"I already know about the Rational Male and I like it. I've also found Roosh's Audiobook on Game quite therapeutic. Are there any other good redpill-style books that guys here can recommend that specifically focus on the male-perspective and theory of getting through a bad breakup?  
Any books that cover, ideally, oneitis, the withdrawal from attachment, getting zeroed-out, ego death etc.  


Background of my story (it is the archetype);  


\- i'm 32

\- extensive history of pumping and dumping women and enjoying all the benefits of cultivating redpill pua skills. Never really bonded to a woman or fell in love, but lots of mini-relationships. This left me with no skills/experience in managing a woman in an LTR. I was an expert short-term lover.

\- I got player burn-out at 30 years old and LTR'd a 22 year old woman that I ended up falling in love with. 

\- The relationship started with me having all the frame/control, she was a love slave. This lasted for 6 months and I began to feel bored/suffocated. I wanted to bang new women, but I wanted to hold onto my LTR because she had many good qualities that I knew were rare (intelligence, low-notch, good sense of humour, genuinely fun to hang out with, great sex, amazing body).

\- I got complacent and sloppy, cheated on her multiple times. Got caught red-handed. She left and came back a few days later. 

\- The relationship continued but I lost frame and gave into the ""feels"".

\- I assumed she would never leave me because she had (apparently) forgiven me for cheating. I started to see her as a life long companion - the ""feels"" deepened as I thought ""wow, she must really love me if she's forgiven me for cheating multiple times.""

\- As soon as I started treating her well, she began to distance. I pushed for more commitment and she distanced even more. This made me feel needy and confused (My lack of LTR experience made it worse). Her distancing was a very gradual process, but soon it became undeniable. She started increasingly prioritising seeing her friends. I knew I was in trouble at this point. This went on for 18 months. Sex was still very frequent, gave her lots of orgasms, and I think this is the main reason she stuck around.

\- Her attitude towards me deteriorated. Increasingly dismissive, ill-tempered and expressed desire for more friends and more activities outside the relationship. Just being with me wasn't enough for her anymore.

\- I eventually got sick of it and I went for a power move and broke up with her, hoping it would bring her into line. She was upset, chased for a few days then abruptly blocked me everywhere (social media, phone etc) and ghosted. I was shocked. Found out later the friends had intervened and she was in therapy. I was painted as the ""abusive ex"" and she wanted nothing more to do with me.

\- I didn't contact her for 2 months and began the moving on process. Covid hit and made life more difficult. I managed to bang several women, but no one compared to my ex (who I'd now placed on a giant pedestal).

\- I found that I needed to build new friendship groups - all my old friends were heavy drinkers and drug-users and I didn't want to associate with that anymore. I've still found making new friends that I'm actually interested in quite difficult. I've realised that my ex had become my best friend and that there was now a gaping hole in my social life. What a huge mistake.

\- After 2 months I felt stronger and thought I might try to re-attract her (going against all established wisdom). Complete failure.

\- Stalked her for a few weeks. Buzzed her apartment, tried to call her from a different number. She threatened to get a police AVO. I realised that my Oneitis could get me arrested.

\- She suddenly unblocked me and said I caught talk to her if I was mature and respectful. I saw this as an opening and I called her and tried to seduce and dirty-talk her, tried to get her to meet me. Complete failure, and she went back to ignoring me again.  


\- I'm at the point now where I appreciate the complete and utter mental disease that is Oneitis and I need help. I recognise the woman I loved doesn't exist anymore (Lightswitch effect has taken hold) and what I'm trying to ""get back"" is now gone forever - she's a changed woman. Toxic hope lingers that she might change her mind one day, but I know that this is my mind playing tricks on me.

\- It's now 5 months after the breakup and I'm only just beginning to come to terms with the Loss.  


Any advice appreciated and I hope there are other guys here that can related to this experience of getting completely zeroed-out by a woman.",8,1

Does Love Only Exist for Alphas?,"Yo this thread is to discuss some things ive noticed on the sub and air my thoughts out. If i sound like a fag, dont hesitate to roast me. Ive been talking some shit lately because I see a lot of purple trash i dont like on this sub, so take a shot at me if you want. But make it good or i will light your ass up. 

Several things have stuck out to me lately. One was, i was discussing prostitution. I feel prostitution is a life hack. Hear me out, what is the main thing a woman can use to gain power over a man? Sex. Also love but I will get to that. Think about it, if you dont care about fucking a woman its peak IDGAF mentality. Some girls that show interest in me at work I specifically call bro and keep my face neutral when we talk, because ive been boned in the past for having sex with co workers. Im sure lots of us have leaned blue and fallen in love with a woman and her sex and been basically gutted for losing frame and acting weak. Even if you are good at sex you can fuck up. Why is this relevant, another poster made a statement I saw. 'Whats the point of fucking if there isnt passion? Id rather masturbate, i please myself better than a woman'. First of all , i disagree. I will someday make a separate thread discussing prostitution theory. 

But the guy was telling me so much and ive heard it before. The passion, being desired, female validation. Guess what, good sex feels like an expression of love, that goes for men and women. But is that always the case, hell fuckin NO. In my opinion, these mostly redpill men are trying to safely  SIMULATE feelings of love still. Thats how i took it. Borderline creeping around the edges, a lit of us dont want to believe this shit. We had to

The anticipation phase, the desire, the energy when the relationship is fresh and hot and your dick gets hard just being around her at times. And as some of us can, you can feel her pussy get wet. Call me stupid, its a thing, i can feel it when a woman in my space gets wet talking to me and there is a range. From slight attraction to outright soaked. I know some of you have felt this thing im describing. 

Blah blah these guys crave love. But we have been burned. This redpill sexual strategy is hacking the matrix and trying to induce lovelike feelings in women while protecting out own emotions with knowledge like AWALT, hypergamy, and its just our turn. She isnt yours (in 2020). That is somewhat a core of this lifestyle. RP just scientifically shifts the power balance to men by us educating ourselves about how to play the dating game. For many it is a barrier against further emotional pain and trauma. There are some heartless slayers here, but there are more jaded, hopeless romantics. Mgtow - only way to win is dont play the game. These guys know they csnt help but fall in love, but true love does not fucking exist for everyone anymore. 

So let me get to the point. Older redpill men, who we need more than ever. I see some squabbling lately, dont give up. This is your sub, you were here first. I applaud GLO and max peenor stand out, they fight back. Dont let these purple cunts disgust you so much you cant stand being here, please. In my case, i made a thread last year i was in a bad spot. Fresh out of jail and having unsafe sex with a mentally unstable, single mom, dangerous ltr that I loved. That i still love on some level, i wont lie. A user that isnt as active lately (I checked not gona use his name) said ""KV, i cant even count the ways youre fucking up. You need to stop this fuckin shit and cut off people who will drag you down, you stupid fuck"". And i had like 40 other rah rah backslappin posts in the thread but his was the one I took seriously. And i listened, i quit fucking her. This crabby old bastard basically saved my ass, and thats a big reason why i am Loyal to this sub and i will call you fuckers out if i think youre being a dumbass. Because I fucking care, you bitch. 

80/20 rule. The women want alphas, duh. But almost everyone wants to be loved. I have been 'loved' , could i maintain it until i die, i dont think so. Close but not in 2020. I made a comment the other day, its profound for a nerd. 'Redpill men are less likely to have children but we make better fathers'. We fucking Know the truth. I dont want it to be true, i got pistol whipped in the face by it. Our families need our leadership. Women need our leadership. There is an existential crisis. The world needs gunslingers more than ever and half of us are nihilists that just wana cum, watch the world burn, and pour gas on the fucking fire. I was born alpha, society tried to make me a pussy. I want to save people not dance on their grave. 

What is the truth? What if we arent all Stipe Miocic? That total stud, UFC champion , firefighter. Beautiful family. I see guys say they feel empty, you know why?! Cuz being a selfish hedonist fucking sucks after awhile. We want to teach, we want to lead and mentor, we want to create, we want to grow. The world needs us more than ever and were like Rorschach looking down at the chaos and violence and pain and saying ""fuck you"". Because we are mad we got hurt. I cant accept that fucking shit.

Don't talk about fight club.,"Today My LTR sent me a screenshot from one of her friend's stories on WhatsApp about him sharing something from Illimitable man's twitter (If you don't know who is this, read the sidebar).

She proceeded by saying that she spoke to her friend (M, 24 years old), and he shared with her other similar accounts, and she started asking me what I think of some the techniques shared, I kept it cool, didn't react or anything, and I changed the subject real quick.

She said she felt offended and she is about to block the dude etc, I was like you do you girl, she started shit testing me and trying to get a defensive opinion out of me about the anti-feminism tweets the account is sharing, and how some other similar accounts speak about how you should throat fuck your girl and let her text first after.

I wrote this post to remind you that if this is any of you, please stop, it's just pathetic to share something that's supposed to be meaningful for you, privately, not as a flex in your WhatsApp story, cause you will share something, girls will read it, and think that you're a creep, and at the end of the day they're going to suck an alpha cock who is aware of the red pill, but he doesn't speak about it like the first chance he gets.

Reminder: Women are sluts,"Reminder: Women are sluts 

###Intro:

I have recently implemented this mindset into my approaches and it had done wonders for my game. 

What led me to adopt the mindset that women are sluts? This is surely blasphemous and I would certainly be kicked out of any respected institution for spouting such things. Well, what led me to this conclusion was a tinder hookup‚Äôs obsession with my big dick (not just a brag). 

###Body:

That got me thinking, there is a reason why people say women like big dicks. It‚Äôs because they do, and not just because they‚Äôre big, but because women love sex and everything to do with it. 

This slut that I hooked up with was obsessed with my dick not because it is somehow magnificent, but because she is a slut who loves sex and all things related. 

Somehow we grew up with the misconception that women are pure and want very little to do with sex outside of a loving relationship. This is dead wrong.

Women love sex with dominant men. When a dominant man confidently walks up to proposition a woman for sex she is already thinking about his dick. Women love having their hair pulled and asses smacked while being hit from behind by dominant men. This goes for all women, young and old, attractive and unattractive. This is a hard pill to swallow, especially if you‚Äôve spent the majority of your life trying to get one or two girls to love you back. 

The thing is, most people think you need high smv to be allowed to be dominant with women. Two things here: One, you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to be dominant, that defeats the purpose. Two, you can be dominant without high smv. Dominance, in fact, leads to high smv and not the other way around. You can still be a high smv cuck. 

Alright, so, all women are sluts. What to do about it. 

Well, this is not a bad thing, it just means become dominant and take the sex that you want (within legal limits).


#####Approach: 

See a girl with a fat ass in tight jean shorts, approach her. She has her ass out for a dominant man who likes it to come take it. Be that man. Remember, you WILL get rejected. Some girls are busy, some are bitches, and some just find you to be ugly. That‚Äôs fine, some girls will think your hot and want your dick, find them. 

#####Be Dominant: 

This starts before the approach with lifting. When approaching, approach slowly with eye contact the whole way, this way she knows that you‚Äôre coming for. I‚Äôve had girls say ‚ÄúI have a boyfriend‚Äù, before I open my mouth. That‚Äôs what you want. When you do open your mouth talk slowly and deeply. Strong eye contact is key, look at her knowing she likes it rough. 

#####Escalate: 

This is also part of being dominant. Ask her if she‚Äôs single, comment on her body, and physically escalate. Women like it when a dominant man acts entitled to her body. Obviously I don‚Äôt condone assault or anything of the sort. If she‚Äôs not having it she‚Äôs not having it, use some social intelligence. If she gives you any reason to touch her go for it. For example talking about a tattoo, doing something you like, etc. If she‚Äôs laughing, giving eye contact, and asking questions, that‚Äôs usually free reign to do whatever you want. 

#####Close :

As a dominant man you know what you want and take it. If it‚Äôs not for the taking you leave. This means that you approach, chat her up a bit and find out if she‚Äôs single, then get her number and dip. You do not stick around to chat with your new BFF. You‚Äôre not here to chat, you‚Äôre here for sex, make that clear. 

Text for logistics and fuck her good.

#####Reminder:

You are the prize. You are the one with the balls to approach her for sex (which she wants by the way). Let her impress you, just look at her and ask a few questions. 


###Summary:

Women are sluts. They carefully and collectively craft a facade of being innocent. Every girls is a slut deep down and they know it. They just don‚Äôt want us to know it because then it becomes a lot harder to be a woman.

Imagine all of the relationships that would end if all men knew how slutty women are. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre only slutty for dominant men. Relationships for women are for validation, resources, image, and security. They can get sex on the side.

If you have a problem with calling women sluts then you are still living in a fantasy.",106,1

###Body:

Women are sluts. They try everything in their power to make us believe that they don‚Äôt love sex. However, when a dominant man who wants to fuck her comes up to talk to her, she‚Äôs already thinking about his dick. 

Women love getting fucked hard by a dominant man. This is not an easy pill to swallow, especially if you‚Äôve spent most of your life trying to get one or two girls to love you back, but you need to accept it if you‚Äôre to make any progress. 

I‚Äôm not particularly high smv, I lift, I go to a good school, but I‚Äôm still young (20) which puts me low on the smv scale. The thing is, you don‚Äôt need high smv to be dominant, high smv is a byproduct of dominance, not the other way around. 

Every girl you see walking down the street, old or young, single or taken, wants to get dicked down hard by a dominant man. They love the feeling of being submissive in sex, having their hair pulled, ass slapped, and fucked hard from behind. 

So, how do you act on this.

#####Approach: 
See a girl with tight shorts and a nice ass?approach. She has her ass out because she wants a dominant man who likes it to come take it. Be that man. Remember, rejection happens, some girls have boyfriends, some are bitches, some aren‚Äôt attracted to you. Cool, many are and many want dick, find them. 

#####Be dominant: 
Dominant body language (legs spread, shoulders back and arms relaxed). Strong eye contact when walking up to her so she knows what‚Äôs up, and open with a deep voice. I walk up to girls like this sometimes and as soon as I open my mouth they hit me with ‚ÄúI have a boyfriend‚Äù, she knows what I‚Äôm after. When taking to her keep in mind that she loves to have her hair pulled and ass smacked while taking it from behind. 

#####Escalate:
Ask her if she‚Äôs single, comment on her body, if she gives you anything you can use as a reason to touch her, do so, just have plausible deniability. Example, today I approached an older woman and I opened with a question, she responds by asking ‚Äúwhat are you, fbi?‚Äù My response? ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre under arrest,‚Äù and I grab her arms put them behind her back and bend her over a bit. She looks at me, laughs, and says I‚Äôm crazy (pussy is now wet). The key to escalating is remembering she‚Äôs a slut and she likes it when you assert ownership over her body. (I don‚Äôt encourage any assault or anything of the sort. If she‚Äôs not having it she‚Äôs not having it, doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs not a slut, just not for you.). If she‚Äôs giving you good signs like eye contact, asking questions, you can generally just touch her freely. (Use some social calibration.)

#####Close: 
If she‚Äôs giving you good signs get her number and get out. She‚Äôs a slut, but she‚Äôs a ‚Äúbusy‚Äù slut. Keeping up the facade of not being slut is hard work. She has a job to go to, a phone call to make, or any other number of things to do. Walk up, show her you want to fuck her, get her number if she down, leave. 

#####Fuck her: 
Text for logistics and fuck her good. 

#####Prize mentality: 
Remember, you are the prize. You are the one with the balls to walk up and try to fuck her (which she wants by the way) so don‚Äôt take any unnecessary shit.

###Summary: 

Girls are sluts. They work very hard to collectively give an image that they are pure and are in relationships for personality etc. In reality, they love sex and the feeling of being dominated by a dominant man. They enter relationships so they can have some security while they wait for chad to find her and dick her down. 

Don‚Äôt fall for a relationship with a women. For women, relationships are about resources. If you want sex with women, just walk up to them and take it.  

What helps is to lift and to not be a pussy. 

If you have trouble with calling girls sluts, then you‚Äôre still living in a fantasy.",8,1
How do you explain this behaviour? She uploaded slutty pic shortly after she blocked me,"So a while back I befriended this girl on Reddit (downvote me if you like, It just gives me the illusion of not being a lonely POS) and she basically insisted that I wasn't ugly and actually good looking, so I added her on insta and Snapchat and all that, but she never sent me any lewds even when I tried to get some, and her Instagram feed was pretty prudent, like no revealing pics or whatever, just a normal feed.

all was going good until she left one of my selfies on read and I basically became convinced that she suddenly ""realised"" that my face is in fact ugly, so I ended up sperging out on her asking her at what specific point she realised that my face is weird looking, and she said that I was just average, not ugly but not a supermodel either, which was fucking weird because at first she absolutely insisted that I was pretty good looking, now all of a sudden she says I'm just average? Like wtf. She ended up blocking me on everything after my outburst.

This is the thing I want explaining though, like I said her Instagram feed didn't have any revealing pics like most girls have, but literally the fucking minute she blocked me, she posted a pic of her in a crop top showing cleavage and her whole body, I used one of my Insta alts just to see if she screenshotted my outburst and posted it or something, then I saw that she uploaded this semi slutty pic shortly after blocking me on everything.

Why did she do this? Is it some kinda flex or what? I just thought it was weird and want your guys input",16,1

Frame control and how emotions can make or break you,"When I first found the Redpill, I went Rambo like a mother fucker. I was beaten down and ready for the pill and I greedily devoured it without second thought. I was already physically attractive, confident and had most of the tools I would need to become Chad Thundercock. What I didn't have was frame. More specifically, the emotional component of my frame was lacking. At the time my current mentor and most of the veterans  on MRP would tell me ""You don't have the frame for that."" It was frustrating to me but completely true. 

Most guys don't know that their frame is weak and they certainly don't know which part is weak. Frame is a stool comprised of 3 equally important components: Emotional, Physical and Intellectual. I had the physical and intellectual down but the emotional piece was still significantly lacking. This resulted in me consistently ending up in my ex wife's frame. Women are masters concerning the emotional realm and even men with a strong frame can get into trouble if they do not watch their P's and Q's. Women don't do as well in the logical realm and know it's going to be an easier fight if they can pull you into their frame and get you worked up. The chances of saying some weak ass faggot shit goes up astronomically when you get emotional. 

Once I was able to understand my emotions and triggers I began to learn to control myself. Now I can tell when others are emotional and I have learned to calibrate myself to get what I want. I honestly don't think many really know what true frame or how to get it.  Frame is very simple to understand if you have children. I have 3 kids and they all have incredibly strong frames. Children and women don't have a true frame because they aren't aware of it but it's still there in a sense. I always got in trouble as a kid because I refused to join the frame of teachers or authority figures. When my kids come over to visit, they immediately shift into ""Daddy mode"" and they adopt my vibe. Simply put, they are always in my frame because it's safe, fun and they have little reason to challenge it. They don't need to worry about shit, they just show up ready to have a great time. I lead them on adventures and bring them cool places I would want to go with or without them. I control the frame and everyone chooses to live in my reality. They exist in my world and they happily join me there. 

The other day I was on a little paddle boat with my main girl. She doesn't normally smoke weed with me but has been enjoying it more as of recent. We decided to paddle across the middle of the lake and see how long it would take to get to the other side. On the way back, it ""felt"" like we weren't moving as fast and that we were fighting a current or something. Because we had been smoking pot, the hamster wheel was about to light on fire and the paranoia had crept in. She was starting to get worried, I could hear it in her voice. I was high as Jesus on a spaceship as well and I actually started to question the validity of what she said. In my mind, I joined into her frame and began to take on her anxiety for a brief moment. I decided to fall back on ""STFU"" which is your best bet when you don't quite know what to say or how you feel. Up to that point I was in bliss and getting a great tan. Shutting the fuck up can actually save you from breaking frame if you don't know how you feel or how to proceed. 

I actually wasn't sure if we were moving or not and stopped the boat completely. I let us just kind of spin around without paddling and wanted to see what happened. The wind was pushing us towards the general direction we wanted to go and I was confident we would make it across at some point. Now I could have taken this situation in two directions. I could have joined her frame and panicked. I could said ""OMG, what if we get stuck out here?"". I wouldn't have had a good time and we would have been full of anxiety. Her attraction would have dropped because I joined her frame and became anxious and weak. I opted to challenge her frame with questions. ""Do you think we are moving towards the direction we just came from or is it pushing us back in?"" She was telling me that we were in fact moving backwards in the wrong direction. We discussed this for a bit and tried to use landmarks to see if we could discern the direction of our movement but our perception was distorted due to the amount of water around us and a lack of objects. The wind was blowing at our backs and I asked her if that was accurate. She agreed. At this point I asked if the wind was blowing us towards the shore we wanted or if we were going against the wind via magic. She said we were going against the wind but didn't know how. Logically, this made no sense to either of us but she ""felt"" like it was true. Even against the data we had her feelings lead her to this belief and she was unwilling to let go of it. I chose to ignore her frame (based off Feelz and not the Realz) and gave her a better frame to jump into. In my frame, I was having an amazing time listening to music and paddling across the lake with perfect sunshine. Getting to the other side didn't really matter because the journey was the important part. After 15 minutes, we actually got closer to the buoy near the middle of the lake and she finally admitted that her belief was wrong. Her anxiety never grew because I didn't join her frame and give her more anxiety, I remained calm and gave her a better reality. We both laughed at her and have a funny story where I can remind her that her perception and feelings aren't always accurate. 

Feelz / emotions drive women in all of their decisions. Even when given clear logic they will choose their feelings. This doesn't make women bad people, it just makes them women. If you can learn to master your emotions and pay attention, you can manipulate any situation you want into whatever outcome you find desirable. The world is your oyster when you can learn to master your emotions and manipulate others with theirs.",85,1

Three Sexy Sex Secrets Every Alpha Must Try,"The Red Pill is a discussion of sexual strategy in a culture increasingly lacking a positive identity for men. But have you ever noticed that while the Red Pill provides a plethora of sexual strategies for getting women into bed, it doesn't have any strategies for when they are in bed? This is a blind spot desperately begging to get filled. Which is why today GayLubeOil is going to fill it. Obviously the percentage of men here who have real sex with actual human females and can actually benefit from this post is low. Believe me I get that. This post is like Republican tax cuts, it favors the top 1%. However rather than getting mad at me for writing advice you will not be able to apply, be mad at yourself for being an unfuckable beta male who can't apply it. That's actually the first step to not being a beta male. It's called the anger phase, look it up.

**Coom in Her Zoom:** There are three types of men in this world. Normal Men who have sex with hot fertile college girls. Absolute degenerates who waste their precious creamy loads in the baren loins of dried up old grannies aka MILFs, and you who cums predominantly in his right hand but sometimes left. Now on the off chance that you are sexually involved with a college woman you know that she wastes an inordinate amount of time sitting in Zoom calls while diddling her smartphone out of view. Kindly take her cellphone out of her hand and replace it with your penis. There's a hundred people on that call, so someone spotting the swicheroo would be like finding Waldo on their first time. 

Put a book up near the camera so it looks like she‚Äôs studying really hard and so you can obscure the transition of her body position. Next you‚Äôre going to need to reposition her hips so that they‚Äôre out of view while she leans her elbows on the desk. Be sure to waive to everyone 
else on the call, but not too obviously, since some teachers aren‚Äôt okay with someone else sitting in on the call if they aren‚Äôt in the class. You know what cums next. *Coom in her Zoom!* Wham, bam, thank you ma‚Äôam. After the fluid exchange is complete, disappear faster than Kenyan economist and notorious Cooter Looter: Barack Obama Sr.

*The Reverse Blowjob:** All right rational males, this one is a bit complicated so I'm going to have to ask you guys to take a deep breath and examine the facts, slowly one at a time. Sucking dick and being gay are synonymous. If a person sucks dick they are gay and if a person is gay they suck dick. Pretty simple right? Ok. Next people who stare at gays while sexually aroused are also gay. Ok. But here is a conundrum. Given the facts, how do you get a blowjob without being gay? Sounds impossible right? Wrong. Here's a secret @itiswr1tten taught me while we were flying on a private jet to Africa spreading WuhanFlu2, the updated version of the nonleathal KungFlu. 

If you don't want to be gay. You gotta opt for the Reverse Blowjob. Walk into the kitchen (where women belong), assume the Superman power pose and confidently yell ""Ay yo bitch hope you'se hungry cuz I got you a hot dog chicken nugget sandwich."" Then perform a 180¬∞ spin jump and immediately upon landing pull down your cargo shorts, and hike your penis and testicles behind you while squatting like a linebacker. After the elegant gymnastics are over yell ""I got you a treat bon appetit!"" Women like french because it's romantic. This is the only sexual strategy that prevents you from making eye contact with the gay woman performing felacio. Unlike blowjobs which are gay, reverse blowjobs are straight because they are the reverse of gay. 

**The Halo Combat Evolved:** People always tell you to never abandon your childhood dreams. But when was the last time you sat down and even remembered your childhood dreams? Can you even recall what they were? Or were your hopes and aspirations slowly replaced, pushed out by a steady monotonous hum of office work, spreadsheets and performance reviews? Luckily for you GayLubeOil is here to slap you awake from Corporate Corpse World of Blue Pill conditioning and reawaken your long dormant youthful virility.

So what even were your childhood dreams? You don't have to answer because I already know. **Teabagging.** You spent your childhood playing Halo, Call Of Duty, Team Fortress and Counter Strike while yelling racial slurs into a headset in a shrill prepubescent voice. But did you ever follow through on your dreams of teabagging in RL? No. Let's change that.

Just like in Halo, you gotta wait till she‚Äôs in a vulnerable condition, preferably on her back after a long day of making TikToks for the Communist Party of China . Go over, take a knee for Black Lives Matter, and fit your smooth sack into her Starbucks Frapachino basic bitch mouth hole. Then pull 'em out before dropping them back in like a teabag. Repeat for desired effect. This is a dangerous place for your boys to be in, so be sure that she‚Äôs awake and you never break eye contact. You're the Master Chief, make sure she understands this.

So what is the thesis of this post? Is it about sexually denigrating women by feeding them hot dog chicken nugget sandwiches and teabagging them like FPS noobs? Is this a roundabout attack on the university system which teaches women nothing of value and wastes their most fertile productive years? Yes but it's far more complicated than that. When supreme Alpha Genius GayLubeOil was writing this post he knew that he could piss off all of the stoic behavior guide spergs that just want an employee manual on how to get laid.

This post is a diagnostic. If a bro humor sex guide posted to a men's sexual strategy community upsets you it's because you're an uptight introverted Eliot Roger autist. The easiest way to out introverts is to write ultra extroverted. You're the problem. Women won't fuck you because not only are you not funny. You are anti-funny and anti-sex. Humor and sexual language upset you. You will never get laid because you are anti sex. Now get in my comments, tell me how mad you are and prove me right.

The world is rapidly changing. If you want to come out on top you should use this time to get in the best shape of your life mentally and physically. I‚Äôve created a public [Telegram channel](https://t.me/ascetus), an uncensorable fortress, for my spiciest content that you won‚Äôt find on Reddit. 

I‚Äôve mentored thousands of men through fitness and philosophy coaching, here are a few of [their experiences in their own words](https://glophilosophy.org). You can contact me through that link or shoot me a PM if interested.",67,1

Don't make women your enemy.,"They make up 50% of the population. A lot of you sound like you find all women untrustworthy or just generally unworthy of your love and affection the way your brothers or other men in your life do. 

I don't mean to say to fall in love with them. That's something which will just pave your way into a Oneitis which is usually an impending doom. 

I'm saying don't hate them, not calling you guys misogynists, don't get me wrong, but in deriving pleasure from them we often equate them to as our mere subjects we use for pleasure.

Have women in your life with whom you have obviously platonic relationships with and love them, care for them, share your pains and emotions with them. Understand how that they are human and know what you're doing when you fuck the feelings of the many women you plate and use. I'm not telling you to stop doing that, no way. Just be aware of your actions and the aftermath of those actions, that's being truly red pilled. To know that you're a man who will do anything and everything you can (if your own personal code of ethics allow it, that is. Yes, your own, not a stupid subreddit's code or some book's) to get the pleasure you want from life and people and that you can acheive so without being a dark-triad cutthroat motherfucker. 

I for one have enormous respect for my sister and my mother, you will say all women are like that and yes they have been to me the most surreal examples  of it. I'm not a blind beta bitch. 

I can see their reality but I know that I will never put myself in such a position as to have myself fucked over by them, it's not even possible for me to do that. 

Now, I have this same behaviour in regard to other women. I like treating the conservative women (as rare and sometimes average looking they are) like queens when I will it and when I want to. You can be kind and generous without losing frame to a woman, I hope The Red Pill forum hasn't lose the sight to that.  

There are also many women whom many of you guys avoid and hard next just because you're on your agenda to fuck as many women as you can. As a wise man once said, any number which gives you pleasure as it increases can never satisfy you. There will always be more women or an Alpha with a higher n count than you or better, more ""heavenly"" sex than you've already had. 

It's an unending cycle. 

What us men should cherish is high quality women, not just though appearance but by other factors as well. A woman who can pitch in the same amount of banter as I can and at the same intensity (I'm yet to meet a woman funnier or wittier than me, however, but I'll keep looking I guess) is, to me, a far better catch and a far better fuck than some blonde blue eyed broad who cannot count to 15. 

It's fun to please women and make them beg for more. Giving pleasure feels just as good as getting it if you're with the right sort of women. 


Us men should stop going for sluts as much as we do. I know, Lizard brain and whatnot and yes you guys obviously have the right to fuck the women your dick gets hard to, but it'd be just better for the culture if all of the Alphas showed a general distaste of less promiscuous women. 

Yes, the hypocrisy will exist where the Alphas are themsleves players and have incomparably higher n-counts but atleast the number of sluts would decrease. And not like women will do anything mroe than maybe pointing out the hypocrisy. They can't. Sluts need to be decreased, even the pretty ones lose their ability to capture a genetically gifted Alpha in their claws when they get played one too many times by half assed PUAs who just happen to have a few brain cells more than her. 

I don't know how many of you guys agree with Eugenics, but I do. I feel men and women with better genetic abilities should reproduce and the ones who cannot keep up with the increasing genetic disparity should either get cooped up in their lower class background (I'm also counting Intelligence Quotient and EQ and other forms of intelligence as better genes, as they are mostly provided by nature and not nurture) or they can just simply choose to keep their genetic material to themselves. I think a woman such as Natalie Portman, who has an IQ of 130 and is a Harvard Alumni, would rank much, much higher than some whore with a better, more exotic face, eyes and hair or even if she had a perfect ass and rack. Intelligence and charm trumps most other genetic traits, maybe sometimes height and other physical inheritances such as more endurance or better for sports genes make a massive difference but largely intelligence trumps everything. You want smart babies not pretty but stupid ones. Their red hair won't help when they get addicted to drugs or drop out of high school. 

I'd like to ask you guys to raise the importance of other characteristics other than looks and how you can be genuinely attracted to them as well. I consider myself a 50% sapiosexual, I find women with intellect close to mine or higher very very attractive, and I want nothing more than them on their knees begging for my dick. Call it a fetish but I love nothing more than women begging me for me. 

I also remember that this once I got hard to the sound of a girl I met through Instagram and it was lovely putting my dick in her mouth a few weeks later. 

There was also this one story of a blue eyed blonde woman who was the plate of the OP's friend, who ends up becoming batshit crazy and burns the said friend's car down. 

Now what I believe is that these sort of jealous, vindictive women can be tamed by their own neuroticism. If you gaslight them enough to understand that their own faults and their own mistakes are the reason that they are losing you from their hands, they can cower and accept defeat and try to better themselves. And what I love about crazy and obsessed chicks is the passion they have. They can do anything and everything for you. That's a great power you can exploit under the right circumstances. 

Don't wife such women but LTR them till they are of use to you. I'm thinking about such an LTR which can be of massive help to me professionally (think Amanda Cerny helping her boyfriend out with her own share of fame). 

Don't hate women so much more than you hate men. You should hate a good amount of people because a vast majority is ineffective and useless and even worse, they are jealous miserable losers who will never achieve an inch of success that you will/already have. 

Women can be just as useful to you as your male brothers. You just need to use them differently and know how to. 

My female friends are able to sometimes have the emotional sense to guide me or listen to me in ways that none of my male friends ever could (see : lack of empathy due to high testosterone)

Now those friends are obviously ones I'd either make me orbit me or ones I'd never be attracted to sexually. Orbitters you friendzone can be of massive help to show you how superior you are for a certain class of not-so-bad women. They'll remind you that them and a whole bunch of women wouldn't blink twice before fucking your brains out and if that doesn't make you feel better about being rejected from one stupid twisted broad, I don't know what will. Maybe lifting. Maybe sports or something else. Never video games. 


TL;DR - eugenics, acknowledge other aesthetics in women apart from outside appearance like humor and intelligence, love but sparingly, don't think rigidly, women are not evil, the word is. Women are lovely and adorable sluts. And it's not their fault.",21,1
Guide to start lifting [For TRP beginners],"&amp;#x200B;

*This post is intended for those who are just discovering TRP (if such a thing still exists since the reddit quarantine) and are scared of applying the most important and fundamental principle : ""LIFT"". If you're already lifting, skip this one.*

&amp;#x200B;

\----------

# Summary

*Don't*: 

* be scared of being judged,
* ashamed of being weak. 

*Be:* 

* scared of injury, 
* ashamed of lack of discipline.

# Body

&amp;#x200B;

**Main obstacle:** ***""what will guys at the gym think of me ??""***

When I first discovered TRP, I remember being scared shitless that the main advice was ""LIFT"". I thought I was gonna look like an idiot: I had no idea how to use the machines, I was weak as fuck. Guys on TRP would repeat that people at the gym didn't give a fuck about beginners, but I couldn't believe it. I was judging myself: why wouldn't the others? 

But here's why others won't judge : because it doesn't make a shred of sense to compare what is not comparable. You can‚Äôt compare apples to oranges, and a few sessions at the gym are sufficient to realize that we are all a different fruit. Is that guy lifting less? Is he lifting more? : Maybe he's training for endurance, maybe he's training for strength. Maybe he's a beginner, maybe he's been doing this all his life. Maybe he lifts because he wants to improve his performance in another sport, maybe he lifts because lifting is his passion. The gym is not a special place reserved for jacked dudes who will laugh at you for not being jacked. **The gym is an open space, where different people do their own different things**.

So what is *your* thing ? 

**Your thing is that you're a patient but disciplined beginner**. You're not any kind of beginner: you're the disciplined type. Because there is *only one thing* that every jacked dude has in common : regularity. Each has his own strength program, but all have regularity. Every single jacked dude has started out not jacked. A stick-armed beginner who comes 4 times a week *will* eventually be respected. Trust me, that's what happened to me. I remember after two months of swiss-like regularity on my part, the jacked dudes at my gym started chatting and being friendly with me, and it seemed like a normal thing, since I was a regular.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**A few tips to start lifting safely :** 

*  I would suggest starting out with just **bodyweight exercices** (push-ups, pull-ups, squats, dips) because it is a familiar mass and so the chances of injury are really slim. Also you can do that anywhere, at the park or at home, so you don't have to instantly tackle the fear of the gym. Once you have reinforced your body (1-2 months of serious training), you'll want to enter a gym anyway. 
* When you try out weights and machines for the first time, the key is *to not give in to the fear of looking weak***. Use small weights**. Otherwise you'll injure yourself and trust me -because I know what I'm talking about- *you don't fucking want that*. Even if that girl over there is lifting that many kgs, *don't try to compete*. Focus on *your* body and *your* sensations. Instead, be proud of your weakness. Think of the tortoise and the hare: **slow, but steady**. Trust that eventually, dedication will triumph. Start by lifting just the bar. Nobody will judge you, because they can see your small arms: they know that if they had your small arms, they wouldn‚Äôt be lifting much more than you. 
* **If you feel weird pain or discomfort:** ***stop immediately*****.** Seriously. You don't want to get injured ever, and especially if you're beginning : it might break your motivation forever. Take a breath, and try doing the movement again slowly. If it still hurts, stop that exercice. Back home, check on the internet the proper form and the risks of said exercice, and try again next session. 
* For programs, tips, anything, **internet is your friend**. Personally I started with bodyweighted push-ups, dips and squats; then simple machines; then free weights with the *Starting Strengh* 5x5 program. After that I was fluent enough to make my own programs. 

Slowly, you‚Äôll get used to the physics of the weights, and then you can start to progressively load up.

# Lessons learned

&amp;#x200B;

* Gym dudes will judge you, but not on what you think: they will judge your dedication.
* Injury and irregularity, not other's judgment, are your enemy.
* Start with bodyweight, at the park for example. The idea is to keep it familiar.
* Go slow, but go regularly.",149,1

How should i try to fuck this girl next weekend?,"Going to try to keep this as short and sweet as possible. Know this girl for ~7 years. Really actually been friends with her for ~3 years. Seeing her once a week or once a month depending how busy our lives are.

My strategy has always been to flirt with every girl from the get go, so I don't have to play these guessing games whether she likes me or not, but 3 years ago I made an exception with this girl to see if I could have a real female friend. I even avoided several opportunities to do anything with her. I just felt like really the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. I try to fuck her and if I'm successful she might feel some type of way after because of the way I have of acting and stop being friends with me.

But now I'm over it. She's mad at me and I think what she really wants is to get fucked. Not the best timing for me but it is what it is. I will try.. So how should I do it? I'm going to invite her to my house to smoke weed...How should I handle the inevitable logic questions?... ""But we are just friends?"" ""But I don't have to feel like I have to fuck you so you see me"" (This is part of a argument we are having. She's saying I spend too much time with girls I want to fuck).",33,1

An insane wake up call about the power of (the lack of) attention,"I got myself into a long distance relationship (I know, real fucking stupid in TRP standards) but I know what I'm doing these days. Unluckily for myself right around the time we became official the government shut the border between our states due to a handy virus so for now my game is truly at an unprecedented time. I won't bitch around about the timing of everything. Here's something that completely shocked me yet also didn't surprise me.

A little bit of extra background info: Discovered TRP 4 years ago, have always been a great conversationalist (except ridiculously awkward with women before TRP but luckily TRP helped change that), no issues with Tinder and can keep conversations going eternally.

Due to the insane lockdown restrictions I'm in right now I straight up cannot go out except to buy groceries or I will be fined. So in turn, I do have quite a bit of extra time these days even after my full time job working from home, workouts, hobbies etc. This has meant that I've upped the amount of messages I send my girlfriend naturally as I have more time. So here's where the wake up call is:

As I am quite a good conversationalist and can keep conversations interesting, I didn't think much of the extra time I'd spend messaging her. We're still in our so called ""honeymooon"" period of the relationship and she has been pretty female RP to me (very submissive nature). We were talking about what things we find unattractive about each other in a very joking way when all of a sudden she genuinely had something to say. After a little bit of hesitation and pushing, she said: ""You know, sometimes you can ignore my messages"". No surprise, yet a smack to my face.

I hadn't been thinking much about the extra replies but it's dawned on me that it's actually on her. While I can keep the conversation going, she can't always do it. Not because she's a woman or a man. But as a person - she just can't keep the conversation going as much as I can. She's great (I got into a relationship with her for a reason) but she's not perfect. She's having to think of replies sometimes when I can just ignore her previous message. She doesn't ignore me which is why she said this. It's a win/win - she doesn't have to use her brain to reply to those messages and the lack of attention makes her want me more. She knows this, and now of course I know this. I'm most definitely going to adjust.

3 or 4 years ago I might have posted this to askTRP about maybe where I've gone wrong conversationally, but now I'm confident I can post it here in the main sub to help everyone. We're truly in unprecedented times everywhere. I hope this has helped you.",13,1

Female Solipsism and Male Fitness,"#Introduction
Female solipsism is a trait bred from having to craft a reality to suit their needs; it is a deviously sociopathic trait that allows women to create their own reality and justify their actions to better the species through competition. If it wasn't good for us, it wouldn't exist. Naturally, solipsistic thought processes are based on rationalization, the process of justifying oneself and one's actions through fact or opinion, *whether the beliefs are justified*, or not.

This leads to many behaviors that are observable, identifiable, and can be utilized for your benefit.

##Solipsism and Fitness
Solipsism will use any means available that makes some sort of sense in order to justify a crafted reality. Spirituality and superstition are simply ways to justify oneself, a habit born of a past dependent upon men.

Superstition, or a belief created by false association in the mind, runs more strongly in women than in men. Women will attribute all manner of things to serendipity, luck, fate, etc. We, as a species, are designed to identify patterns in events. We are very good at it. So good, in fact, when two events occur simultaneously we commonly attribute them to cause and effect, even though the two events may only be correlated, or worse, completely disparate.

Men did not have as much of a luxury of drawing false conclusions, as false results could mean the difference between life and death. Women, however, depended on men to successfully interpret the world for their protection and provision. Men that fail to observe the world more accurately were weeded out by intense reproductive competition. A measure of physical fitness. It is no surprise, then, that women adore men that are capable of creating and sustaining their own vision of the world.

##Spirituality and Superstition
Astrology, witchcraft, voodoo, religion, charms, belief in invisible alien spirits, superstitious creatures and ideas, spiritual healing, ghosts, the soul, universal morality, ""higher"" powers, you name it- chances are that a woman believes devoutly in at least one or more of these things. It is something that guides them and justifies their behaviors- even if evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the causal relationship between the behavior, and the effect it is supposed to generate/prevent, exists.

This is simply because women *fervently desire* an explanation for their existence, for their actions, for why they do what they do. And that is where strong men come in. They provide a framework for women to justify their actions and behavior, in line with the strength of the frame of the man they align themselves with. If the frame decays, so does the solipsistic justification used to associate with the male, and hypergamy and the dual-mating strategy begins anew.

##Use It or Lose It
Familiarize yourself with a few of the common superstitious beliefs and systems. Being able to be fundamentally aware of these beliefs, and choosing when to reinforce or refute them, can drive a very strong attraction and the belief that ""you were meant for each other."" Be genuinely interested in their superstition, get them talking, and make them excited. They love feeling excitement, and the excitement will be utilized by the hamster as a justification for association. Alternatively, deny it, and then draw them in with other potential superstitious alternatives. However you want to frame it. It makes you mysterious and interesting.

Appreciate the female mind. It serves them, and us, well.",52,1

Shit tests at work,"This girl I work with was fucking one of her higher ups in the branch she works at. I have the same position as him, know him decently well, and have worked with him in the past. Now I‚Äôm covering the location she works at and he‚Äôs at a different location. I made asked where he was and she laughed in front of everyone and said ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt talk‚Äù making it clear that they had something in front of everyone when I just asked where he was cuz they worked at the same branch. Then I find out they‚Äôre back together. Then I ask why she has dry cream on her face and she says ‚Äúpimple cream cuz going on a date‚Äù I said ...With Danny? And she said no someone else and then she totally VIBE SWITCHED (mouthing to me to shut the fuck up in front of rest of team...even though she was open about their relationship before in front of same people). Since then it‚Äôs been mocking shit tests, blatant disrespect, and lecturing me on the situation. Now I‚Äôm wondering if I have an HR case coming my way.

Girls fear of men is NOT justified !,"I hear a lot of stories about how they fear walking alone in street when it's dark or when people are not around. Yes, I get it. Women are generally weaker and stuff, I understand.

But on the other hand there are many instances where men get attacked by other men and noone talks about that. I kind of feel bad that every woman on street sees me as potential rapist/murderer. Anytime I walk behind a girl they speed up, or when we walk past each other they avoid eye contact.

But men can get attacked also. It doesn't matter how physically powerful you are, there is a little chance to defend yourself against surprise attack or a gun. Now imagine that I would avoid men and women on street in fear of being attacked. I would be ridiculed. It's not only women that get attacked on street. And I feel offended that every stranger woman automatically fears me and sees me as a creep. Stop being so fearful.... if anything, by this behaviour, you'll only make them more angry, because predators like to chase.

I see this time and time again ""you're scared when guys talk to you because you don't know if they're going to hurt you"" It's completely paranoid to assume that every time a person talks to you they wish you ill intent. Sure there are definitely guys who will harm women, but a small group shouldn't represent the majority. I'm not scared of women bringing me food or making me food because the majority of female serial killers use poison.

Women who act all scared and shit literally ask for the attack",1,1

I‚Äôm predicting that the USA will attack China (in the South China Sea and surrounding areas) before end of 2020, most likely in middle of October, and that as a consequence of an American war against China, the US will also round up all Chinese Americans living in the States into death camps and probably gas us all to death‚Ä¶The US will also attempt to get an alliance to gang up on China, including India, Australia, UK, and possibly Japan and Taiwan‚Ä¶ Mostly very likely they will stage another massive drill and then do a ‚ÄúGulf of Tonkin‚Äù 2.0 style of false flag operation to frame China as the aggressor to set up the pretext and to create the fake ostensible ‚Äòjustification‚Äô needed to then use tactical nukes to flatten the islands in the South China Sea, at the same time the US will be launching a high level EMP (electromagnetic pulse device) above China as well as cutting the sea cables connecting to China so that China loses all electronic communications to the rest of the outside world. This is to blind and deafen China while the attacks are ongoing. Many people say Trump may also order the Three Gorges Dam to be attacked just like the recent US/Mossad false-flag explosion in Beirut, which itself was executed under cover of false attribution to give plausible deniability. If America doesn‚Äôt score a decisive victory in the South China Sea, the next step is the final solution, America will do a surprise pre-emptive nuclear first strike to decapitate the CCP and Chinese leadership, with intent to genocide all 1.4+ billion Chinese people on this planet so that racists America can retain sole unilateral hyper-power status for the next hundred years.

The tail/hint that gave it away was all the countries that previously vowed not to cave to US pressure on Huawei but then later on retroactively reneged after they already came out and stated they would not ban Huawei.

What am I talking about? For example, back in Jan/Feb of this year, the UK originally said they would accept Huawei and would not do a ban on Huawei 5G etc‚Ä¶ and even when Trump personally called Boris on the phone multiple times threatening and begging him to chance his mind the UK still didn‚Äôt relent.

But now one after another, many European/Western nations that previously stood up against the US in not being pressured to ban Huawei have now all suddenly one after another fallen into line. The UK flipped flopped even after having already publicly made and announced the decision‚Ä¶ some say that the whole thing for show and everything was a showmanship thing since UK being part of 5EYES was never gonna accept Huawei in the first place‚Ä¶

But I think something else is going on‚Ä¶. Maybe what changed between Jan and July (other than COVID situation and HK situation) was that US gained enough allied support for an coalition of invasion of China (attack China in SCS etc) that now the US leadership basically tells all their allies/vassals that ‚Äúhey we are going to strike China soon, you are either with us or against us‚Äù‚Ä¶ so now its push comes to shove, allies have to show of support for their master, and since a war is coming and they have already obviously chosen sides, then obviously they are not going to the use ‚Äòenemies‚Äô 5G stuff going forward‚Ä¶. the decision by their leader/master to go to war had completely changed the entire calculus and equation‚Ä¶.

The UK officially on the record attributes its reversal decision to the COVID thing and the HK thing, but that really cannot be the truth since when Boris made the decision early this year, the 5EYES had already known about COVID for at least three months before that! And the HK roits had by that time already been going on for almost a whole entire year‚Ä¶

And it still wouldn‚Äôt explain how the US so quickly got so many other European nations to flip in the span of such a short time, nations that previously publicly stated they would not ban Huawei and wouldn‚Äôt not bow to US pressure all fell in line like dominos‚Ä¶ something dark and evil is going on behind the scenes right now, I can smell it.

This massive capitulation signals something in my opinion far more widespread and sinister than simply changing their minds on Huawei‚Ä¶ I think something very big is about to go down soon‚Ä¶.

So much so that now the UK is sending its own aircraft carriers to the South China Sea to assist US in waging war, with Japan jumping into the mix with as well‚Ä¶

I hope China is prepared to go nuclear to defend itself if needed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ready up the DF-41 and stop being naive‚Ä¶ Seems like we are witnessing a repeat of a global Chinese Exclusion Act 3.0 and a new 21st century version of the Eight Nation Alliance (QUAD x 2 plus add India) that wishes to cut China into a dozen pieces and harvest and pillage China yet once again‚Ä¶. If America doesn‚Äôt score a decisive victory in the SCS, the next step is the final solution, America will do a surprise pre-emptive nuclear first strike to decapitate the CCP and Chinese C&amp;C, with intent to genocide all 1.4+ billion Chinese people on this planet so that Amerikkka can retain sole unilateral hyper-power status for the next hundred years.",5,1
How To Train Your Dog,[removed],2,1
Thank you TRP,"Today is a big day for me and i feel like i have to write this to get closure, i dont care what you think about this post. Also im writing this while drunk so you know this is honest.

When i finished high school i was depressed cause i got shit grades even though i knew that i was at least as smart as my class mates if not smarter. I had a shitty social life and shitty grades, i had literally nothing going for me, and i knew that it was my fault. About 4 years ago maybe earlier I discovered theredpill by accident by going through a redditors history, i began reading all of the posts here but i could never really internalize it.

Through the two years after i finished high school i learned a lot about myself. I've had different jobs but throughout those jobs i've done a lot of reflecting. I've always wondered why i was so weak, why nothing was going right for me and why no girl would ever want me. What my weaknesses were, how i differ from an alpha/redpilled male.

I realised, how could someone else ever want me if i don't even want myself? When i look in the mirror I don't see a person who matches how i want other people to view me. All i see is weakness. But that's what theredpill is all about, realise that everything you thought was right is wrong, you think you're good enough but you're not, you can always be better. Internalise the red pill, embrace it and let it become a part of you. If your frame is strong other people will become a part of it, and your sense of self will grow.

2 days ago is when the red pill really set it's roots in me. I read a post on asktrp and someone in the comments said ""just search for hypergamy on youtube"" so i did and i have to say no post on here could've redpilled me anymore than this. I am thankful to whoever wrote that comment you have changed my life.

Today i finished a course that will make me able to go to my dream university and i finished it with top grades so yeah go me. I went out drinking with my friends afterwards, just having a good time and throughout the night i suddenly realised something. I had always been jealous of other people for being able to have a lot of friends or being able to have girlfriends, but as the night went on i found out these people all had weak as fuck frames. Even the people i thought were popular or good with girls had weak frames.

Tonight I did my first ever cold approach at a bar. I've never approached a girl before. I didn't care what my friends thought or what the girl would think i just went up to talk to her. Talked to her, played an arcade game and danced with her and her friends. After i danced with them you know what i did? I straight up left her, cause i found her boring. I learned a lot from that interaction like for example i should've probably escaleted more with kino and gotten her alone from her friends (I don't know if there is a word for it but it's like girls are ultra-unapproachble if they are groups cause their friends are slutshaming or something). Girls are everywhere and i can always talk to another one. The important thing is that first step.

When you have a strong frame, you are the author of your own future. You are the main character of your story. Other people will enter your frame, admire you for being the main character (taking control).

I've made peace with my past today by visiting the two places where my biggest regrets lie. Even though it might sound stupid i thanked those places for the lessons i've learned and for making me what i am today. Despite me going through shit like being homeless for over a year i wouldn't have it any other way, it made me what i am today.

Today is a new chapter of my life. I am headed in a new direction that I and only I am in control of.

I won't be visiting theredpill or reddit for that matter and will instead be working on myself by cold approaching in the day, working out, and finishing the recommended books here, so these are my final words.

Thank you theredpill",12,1

Spend Time in the Wild in Order to get a Closer Look at Where Your Life is Headed,"For those of you that live in the states, there are some places you can go that are uninhabited by humans and where wildlife exists. Even if you're not in the states, I am sure you can find a place. In these places, you can get your world shaken up in productive ways. It is here that the fear of no food and no water really make you feel alive. But, it is here that the sound of a bear or a wolf can also make you question your own judgement.

When you leave behind your cell phone it is here you can reset and ponder what life really means to you. You see, it's in these times that you realize that the thoughts of living up to the standards of women, or the world in general, begin to unravel themselves into the morning mist. At these times you can be yourself. You can can be one with your thoughts, and you have no choice but to be.

It is experiences like these that make you realize why communities like this exists. It is experiences like these that help you understand why the practice of meditation was developed. You begin to realize t's because the world we know has taken so much from us. Once you're there, it isn't that your sleep schedule is fucked up so much as it is a cause of the many distractions that exist. It isn't that you're eating too much so much as it is a cause of the abundance of food around you. It isn't that you need hobbies so much as it is that boredom is a product of having everything in the world handed to you.

Walking into nature means you're leaving your problems behind. All of the guilt and anger you have, and the self-hatred gets left behind.

Understand, I do NOT say all of this to give you an excuse to indulge in the present world you live in. I do, however, say all of this so you can expereince what it means to NOT have the ABILITY to indulge whatsoever. You take it away from yourself, and all at once. You leave yourself no options to indulge.

Once this guilt and self-hatred has disappeared, and you set foot into the wild, all that exists is fear. And, as the days move forward, you begin to feel safer and less fearful as your strength increases.

This of course, is just the beginning of what you will see once you step foot into the wild.",15,1

It was so bad that at times he had to eat grass to survive. He came to America and got a scholarship, worked his way up a high position in a popular airline company. Needless to say, he knows how the world works and didn‚Äôt take shit from ANYONE. He is a gym rat who is tall and has a booming voice, if he talks you will sit down and listen. He has a keen eye for bullshit and is the reason why I already had a majority of these red pill concepts buried deep in my mind, he is an authoritative male who set an example for my life. If my grades were slipping, he would sit down and teach me the subjects himself. He forced me to join a sport since I was a child. I go to the gym with him on occasion and having good physique is now a priority because HE SET THE EXAMPLE. He‚Äôs the type of man who would drop my mom without blinking if there was any infidelity. No exceptions. Many times my mother would feed me bluepill nonsense about how you must be a nice guy and wait for a girl to come, my father overheard and shut it the fuck down. A lot the things I‚Äôve read on this subreddit he had already taught me, I just couldn‚Äôt put it in words. Please, father your damn son. It‚Äôs a difference between a life of misery and one of happiness. The red pill is dying at an accelerated rate. Don‚Äôt abandon your sons, teach them the way of life and they‚Äôll remember you forever.",131,1

Flotsam in a sea of tism,"I've spent way too much time with RP. I'm one of those guys who loves to get in-depth on a subject. Of all the subjects out there, this is one of the few that pays dividends to my life in so many ways. Sexlife got better, career got better, life got easier to manage ... I was maybe 50% of the way before, but now it's 80% and climbing. I think I owe a lot of it to some of the early guys, Roissy especially. The thing I liked about old Roissy is he wasn't writing to the audience, he was writing to himself. 

Every one of his posts read like *Dear Diary: whamen frustrate the fuck out of me so I gave less fucks and now they aren't so bad.* He laughed at idiots and enjoyed himself. He also hated mudsharking and Democrats, but hey, everyones gotta move onto bigger and better ideals at some point! I like that; not the mudsharking hate but the other thing. It's almost a disdain for the audience, as if they are interrupting his personal quest for greatness.

Everyone who does any amount of blogging, field reporting, or otherwise adds a penny to this worldwide ""take a penny leave a penny"" jar eventually finds themselves in front of an audience. out of every 100% of people in that audience, 1% of them will share, like, upvote or whatever. Of those, 1% will actually comment on something, and of those 90% of them are angry and hateful and possibly stupid but definitely holding a chip on their shoulder about something that has nothing to do with the author. There was even an old reddit post a few years back where someone did a research paper on this phenomenon. If anyone can remember where to find it and link it that would be great.

Back to the point. 

Most of an audience you will never see, barely cares, and may or may not take value from anything here, and that's cool. Not everyone can be a producer all the time for all things. the ones who do contribute are mostly angry people with stupid ideas and a bone to pick or just so bored that pissing people off is the only past time they have at work. It's also possible your article or field report was garbage. You'll never know because people will lose their mind on shit and Shinola equally. I don't write for them. I don't like them and they won't contribute anything of value. I spent a lifetime to get away from shit-tier people and the internet opened up the back door and let them all back in. They shit up everywhere they go and everything they touch turns to autism and it's impossible to kick them all out. There's too many and desperging a space is a full time job which Reddit does not pay well enough to do. Facebook does, but people are in therapy from desperging that place and it takes a huge mental toll.

I figure I'm not perfect at the invisible audience. I often engage people that waste time more than I should. Every day I do it less, and eventually I'll say 'never.' Doing it less is good. It clears up a lot of time for me to write and contribute to a space that I used to be that passive listener to, that 99% guy. When I do, I make efforts to use it as a chance to articulate a thought or experience I've had or learned. 

It's taking the lemons of autism and female outrage and making them into lemonade.

I guess if I had to sum this up with a singular, pithy point I would say this: I'm here for me, not them. I'm lucky in that there's other guys who are also here for themselves and not me. And by sharing the same headspace with these guys it makes me more buoyant in the sea of tism; like flotsam. Floating around fixing whatever thing needs fixing.  I wonder how it feels if some dudes come to the realization that they exist in a space because of a +1 on a social media page looks cooler. I suppose they don't think about it, which explains the tism.",64,1

Boys Will Be Boys - Who You Are,"**Prologue**

One of my childhood best friend's had a, shall we say, ""progressively liberated"" mother. She insisted that we play with dolls like his sister did. We were happy to oblige, but she would get angry at how we played with them. Apparently using the big dolls as guns to pretend and shoot each other wasn't what this mother hand in mind.


***

**Introduction**

Men, from a young age, are dominated by the hormone *testosterone* - aggression, physicality, and risk taking are programmed into boys by default.

One of the best ways to deal with, or understand men is by focusing on their proclivity to aggression and risk-taking, because of testosterone.

The modern male is million's of years in the making. From the dawn of man to now, mem were designed by nature (or a creator if you believe) to have testosterone in order to ensure the survival of himself and his offspring. 

Higher levels of testosterone give birth to more body-muscle than body fat, higher aggression, more fearlessness, and higher sex drives. 

**The expendability of Men**

In Manipulated man from the sidebar, one of the points made is that men are, unfortunately for us, expendable. If you haven't read that you can surely google Hillary Clinton's genius quote on warfare - *""Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat""* 

George Patton &amp; Franklin Roosevelt would be proud of her analysis.

Back to the point, Males produce trillions of potentially fertile sperm over their entire lifetime, but are required to breed with women who only create a few hundred fertile eggs - at the rate of one per month.

So in a village of 100 men and 100 woman, 99 of the men could die in the battle, but the lone survivor could potentially keep his people alive by banging each of his tribal bitches. Reverse those numbers and you got an extinct tribe - unless those men manage to go collect some war brides from their hostile neighbors.

In order for a male to fulfill his predominant biological imperative -- to reproduce himself -- he had to be constantly mating with females. Up until the 20th century, knowledge of the woman's fertility cycle was unheard of, so you had a gamble every time you banged if you wanted to have children. Pretty much fucking every single day until signs of pregnancy showed. 

The survival of mankind required a high sex drive.

It required high testosterone.

(I know I know, a lot of fucking isn't a bad thing, but after the 3rd of 4th time in a row a guy just has to take a break!)

***

**Effects Of T On Boys &amp; Men**

Whether we're in the caveman days or modern times, things have not changed. Men still compete with each other to bang Stacy's -- some willing to do nearly anything just to get a taste of those pink sugar walls. Females on the other hand, still decide who they will have sex with based upon who wins the competition for their ~~pussy~~ heart.

If you are a normal boy, you are dominated by what should be one of your favorite hormones - testosterone.

As a kid you will show more aggressive and tenacious tendencies than girls. For example, a study was done where boys and girls around toddler age were told to pull on a string to get a happy image displayed on a screen. 

After a minute of pulling, the examiners shut off the screen. While the girls gave up after a few pulls with no results and started crying and yelling for help, the boys kept pulling and pulling, getting more forceful and stubborn with each pull.

T also shows itself in men. The motor activity of men is more vigorous than women, but the duration of each motor act is shorter and the peak of the energy happens more quickly. For example sex as men experience it is a quick buildup of arousal, continuously rising until the tension is released in a climax that lasts a few blissful seconds. For woman it's the exact opposite.

Other known tendencies include boys opting to play with guns, swords, or toy soldiers (unless poisoned by progressive parents), their desire to shit talk, their desire to fight or compete, and less empathy. I know this might be hard to hear, but the higher the testosterone, the lower the empathy. This doesn't mean a man is a soulless sociopath, just that they care more about results than feelings.

**Testosterone &amp; Independence**

Boys navigate independence differently than girls. In fact most women never truly experience independence because they constantly look to their friends, their lovers, and the media to define who they are. As a famous psychologist once said, ""The woman does not exist because only women exist."" There is no strong independent single female because they seek approval, validation, and a sense of personal identity from the herd.

Back to boys, us guys have an inborn longing for freedom and adventure. We want to live great and fulfilling lives free from any shackles. If you don't aspire toward this goal you cannot consider yourself an alpha male because only beta males are not free.

The instant a hunter's arrow pieces its bleeding prey, when a charmer lands his biggest sale contract, or when man's second head penetrates wet softness, that man remembers they are powerful and free. 

The thrill experienced in those situations is a cycle of energy -- starting from a swift build up of tension, ending at a powerful and gratifying, decisive release.

***

**The Male Brain**

For centuries people from all schools of thought argued which brain held superiority - The male brain or female brain. 

It was eventually discovered that the weight and volume of the female brain is roughly 10% greater than a females.

Now that we've aged past the ""my brain is smarter than her brain"" stage of life, we can use that brain research to highlight the evidence of differences between the brains of the sexes. Rather than telling men they should behave like women, and telling women to behave like men, we known enough to say the differences between the sexes make us strong. If responsible parents and mentors are to do right by their children, they must acknowledge these differences.

Women have a largest Corpus Callosum in their brains than men do. That callosum is a bundle of nerves that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain.

Because the female cortex develops faster than a males, and it is able to create the larger corpus callosum, females are able to enjoy more cross-talk between the hemispheres of their brain than us guys. 

One of the results of this brain difference is for men to have increased focus on spatial relationships and activity. Men make better architects and engineers based on this trait. If you don't believe me, ask the all female design team who created the now collapsed bridge. They might tell you different.

Back to men, we enjoy manipulating objects to see how they take up space. We sometimes even do this with ourselves when we man-spread. We would also see that men naturally produce less serotonin, a hormone that inhibits aggressive behavior.

Another interesting notion to point out would be that women seem to have more talent for verbal ability than men do. In a scientific test an X-ray showed that when verbal skills were tested, females used more of their brain than men. This isn't to say men can't be silver tongued devils, but rather points out something I noticed back in high school - women just know how to talk better than men, on average. I believe this is because women were born for talking while men were born for action.

**Boys Brains -- High Energy &amp; Taking Space**

Being a man is like being a large dinosaur - you spread everything across your territory and take up all the space. The whole world belongs to you.

Unfortunately, society is drastically against men being strong and independent. This is why in school where boys and young men are always active, laughing, throwing things at each other, they are deemed ""uncontrollable,"" and force-fed ~~legalized meth~~ ADHD drugs / adderall. This is sad because the real solution would be to just let the kids go outside more. So often our male brains will yell out loud, ""Give me more space!""

The male brain tries to recreate itself in the outside world with the games it conjures. Foot ball, soccer, or basketball, all fill large spaces and challenge the male brain's ability at moving objects through space.

Women do the same recreation with games like house, doll life, etc, where they use verbal skills and one on one communication with overtly complex emotional behavior.

Women also want prolonged touch more than us guys, on average. A good way to save your ass from a potential false rape claim is to simply cuddle with your girl after banging her brains out -- even if it's just a few minutes. This is a good way to build comfort. Remember though, push push pull. Maintain balance.

***

**How the Different Brains Came To Be**

Humans spent millions of years hunting and gathering. Females birthed the babies, took care of the home and gathered foods / nesting materials. Males banged the females, formed alliances, and hunted. 

The female brain evolved to do well at what survival required of it, and men's brains did the same.

It is no wonder that females developed to be better at handling emotive data - kids and communities required more emotive processing power than hunting parties.

It is also no wonder that male brains developed better spatial capacities - hunting requires an acute sense of depth perception and distance, as well as a lower emphasis on emotions and empathy - a hunter who feels bad for his prey is a starving hunter.

Finally, it is also a given that the male brain developed better abstraction skills, as society building and culture creation required the ability to abstractly design.

***

**Conclusion**

So when you choose to be meek over assertive, back down rather than stand up, timid instead of aggressive, you are betraying your biological hard-wiring. Every girl you shoulda-coulda-woulda approached is unconsciously pissed off at you for not acting on your propensity towards risk-taking. Every time you approach a girl, you are taking a risk. 

When you meet a person who incites boys to ""become more like girls,"" or ""be more sensitive,"" or ""not like sports and competition so much,"" you have met someone who doesnt understand men. 

If you are a man who fell for that lie, you shot yourself in the foot.

The good news is that since you're here on The Red Pill, you've found the supplies to mend your wounded foot and reclaim who you were born to be.

Banging Chicks for Beginners: A Guide,"# Infant Universalism And Gendered Race: A Brief Study Of Sexual Difference

The call to abolish the police can be seen through the lens of ‚Ä¶ sexual difference. The feminine position is to abolish the police because they are a threat to the black body, which is inscribed with the signifier rather than holding it. There is no need to confirm this through logics or universals.

I have to admit, I often wish to be thought of as a neutral subjectivity despite my graduate school‚Äôs various lesbian professors‚Äô excellent explanations about why that is bad. Infantilely I desire something with no race, no gender, no nothing! This is of course, always when it is most convenient to me. When talking with a black man about race, how nice would it be to not be in the position of the white man, history‚Äôs bad guy! This is the infantile wish. The vulgar notion. When talking to my girlfriend about gender, how I would love to be a chauvinist! This is in the same way, as I would love to eat an entire box of M&amp;Ms nearly all the time. Ultimately, I would sicken myself, but I love a good sweet treat!

Don‚Äôt worry, this isn‚Äôt a weepy article about how you should treat all white men better (unless of course, you feel the need to treat me better specifically, which I am always in favor of). I have of course, black friends (dare I say, the cursed a-black-friend) who I am able to easily achieve this dream with. Race seems to be a total non-issue, and issues of psychology, philosophy, and politics are immediately seen as the pressing issue, and race/sexuality take the signifying position of the M&amp;M.

But‚Äì this is infantile. This is to be treated by the world as if I am baby. Who am I? I am baby. White good. Man good. I‚Äôm baby. No need to do dishes, no need to sweep the floor, all I do is piss and roar!

On to sexual difference: When Lacan says ‚Äúthe woman does not ex-sist,‚Äù this can be immediately looked at as an infantile surplus. To read this in the common sense way, we can eat the M&amp;M of chauvinism and declare, ‚Äúwomen do not exist, I am man! I am rational! I am real! This is what Hegel said I am sure of it!‚Äù

My girlfriend does not want to read this, although she is very beautiful, she is a feminist artist who does not have the stomach to listen to these particular vulgarities. Make no mistake, they are vulgarities, but vulgarities are what crosses the line of what is and allows for new rationality.

In general, I love her because she seems to be overwhelmed by the world while I am underwhelmed by it. She declares the world to be a man‚Äôs world, and she will not submit herself to the oppression of it! I love this! And here I was, thinking the world was so trite, and so dull, now I hear that it is not only not nothing, but evil! Set up by man historically, and is this not simply the truth? And yet, I infantilely forget this.

# Forget Knowledge is Power: Ignorance is Strength

In what way is ignorance is strength? Here I am vulgar again, since it is a specific kind of ignorance which is strength. The ignorance of the emotional impact of the symbolic order while still being able to traverse it smoothly is akin to strength within that order. The therapist knows this all to well, while the client on the verge of suicide is in front of the therapist, the amateur gets drawn into the emotion. The amateur leaves the office shaken, traumatized.

As a young therapist, many a nights I left the office feeling sick and feeling like my arms were dripping with blood, a vaguely psychotic phenomenon but none-the-less I stand by my conversion disorder here as nonetheless rational. ‚ÄúI was so much older than I‚Äôm younger than that now,‚Äù notes Bob Dylan. This points to a mastery of the symbolic order. No longer are the ills of the world hysterically pointed to as ills, but strength is given as the knowledge of the arbitrarinses of the symbolic order is fully grasped. A warning here, know that the symbolic order is not nothing. Man still functions as man, woman still functions as woman, and a white boy is still a white boy (sometimes).

# America: A Symbolic Woman

What is America but the world‚Äôs biggest baby? America can grasp on to freedom and free speech, but it is harder for her to grab onto history. Of course the her of America can easily be taken up by men, as men who lack the signifying aspect of woman in their personal lives treat the country as a woman.

America is always protected from external threats, as some harm can come to her. Her flag is colorful and grasped by men with the same look in their eyes as a fat man with a wife that the less sublte might think is much too pretty for him. The fat man is stoic as he holds America by the waist, showing her off to the world. Look how good she is, look how she is the best.

America is number one, we are fucking the prettiest girl, are we not?

The patriot is a boozer, and will fight any man who talks bad on her with no inclination to the failures of his position which will undoubtedly creep up on him. Since he only has America, he is not America. He can never be America. Even when a man is a general he is a pitty excuse, he is a stoic or a puffed up fool, he is never America itself.

Miss America is the greatest Lacanian: she embodies the volksgeist and understands that America the self and her take on the same characteristic, the thing which the man has. Look how pretty she is. Do a turn. Drop a bomb, baby.

The patriot of any country grasps onto his woman in different ways. The general of a ‚Äúfailed state‚Äù has many such positions to it, as well as the general of a ‚Äúfirst world‚Äù state. Yemen inspires immediate identification when the Real of it forces its citizens to know itself as citizens. The gunfire due to their citizenship becomes unavoidable. War genderizes. War tenderizes. War fragments.

# Elemental Patriotism

Once the war becomes too much, a simple tendency towards identifying one‚Äôs self as having certain things becomes easier than to grasp at a flag. No soldier comes home fully identifying as a soldier, the death becomes too much. It is too much to try to be an American, at least, totally. One must be a certain kind of American.

Sarah Palin is a type of an American, and a woman. She is an Alaskan, and in the being, she is American. This is the feminine position. Or, less reactionarily, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a working class woman, in this sense, she is a Democratic Socialist. In the age where identity plays such a large role in the political sphere, in the rhetorical symbolic order, Zizek‚Äôs call for women as leaders is not simply a biological or symbolic notion (depending on a Freudian or Lacanian read, whichever you prefer).

What do we hold? To hold something trivial is the way to be accepted symbolically, this is clear. Who is going to smack your love of birdwatching out of your hand? You enjoyment of food? To be a chef is clearly a power play, to be a patriot is an idiots cause. To be an anti-patriot is an idiots cause. We should all be chefs if we don‚Äôt want to die, but of course we can‚Äôt help but to go to what has more fuel.

# Black Lives Matter

Racial difference functions in the same symbolic manner as sexual difference. Blackness is inscribed onto a body, and one believes themselves to be black, and in this way, when one is made to be white, one is feminized. They are forced to inscribe the signifier on their body. The body becomes not simply an idea, but pulled by signifiers themselves. Integrated.

The call to abolish the police can be seen through the lens of ‚Ä¶ sexual difference. The feminine position is to abolish the police because they are a threat to the black body, which is inscribed with the signifier rather than holding it. There is no need to confirm this through logics or universals.

This is the case with nearly all activisms. There is always a contingent that pushes the demand through by demanding what may be in fact, impossible. This impossible demand is not merely something which is a failure. It is not simply a sign of a notion incomplete. The irrational is real, even if Hegel doesn‚Äôt want it to be.

# Simping

Now that I have extensively covered Black Lives Matter, let‚Äôs take 1000 words here to talk about simping. The simp is the classic form of man, man has his items with which he simps with. He has knowledge, or he has his virtues.

Misogyny comes in the incel form when man does not know the true nature of his simping. To attract is obvious, but to simp is divine.

I am extraordinarily pro-simp. This is not to say I am not disgusted by simping or having to watch the simp, but I admire their genderfluidity. The simp, in his hysteria, and the simp is always male even when female, in the dream of being called daddy, offers his best of whatever he can find. The white knight is not simply an inconvenience, but something which represents the dream of mankind from time eternal.

Being is a simp-tom, Lacan knew this. I am starting to come to grips with Lacan‚Äôs ancient discovery. Some say Lacan was about linguistics, some say he was about Freud, but was he not ultimately, about the simp-tom? Simp-thomasaquinas, as outlines in Seminar 23, simped for the Catholic Church, and it was this simping which gave him his entire world. On his death bed, Thomas Aquinas was in despair. I like to think he lost his simp-tom, that he looked up, recognized his sophistry, his insistence on god, the pathetic organic nature of the men around him and himself as well, the futility of his efforts in the face of death, and croaked.

# Although let‚Äôs be real, he could have just been tired. Dying is not always easy business.

Joyce was tangled, his symptom removed. Ulysses had lost his simp-tom in his wife‚Äôs betrayal, but then through the journey through Ireland, found another simp-tom entirely. His journey through Ireland, the endless navigating of the multiplicity of subjects, the tiresome vulgarity of it all, the stream of conscious, all grabbing on to the world.

Ulysseus, no longer able to simply simp his wife, went on to simp the world. Object appeared fragmented to him, and he simped those as well. Blocks on the road, lights appearing in high places, all things for him to simp with his gaze and of course, all things for Joyce to simp with his pen.

My girlfriend I am with now I simp very hard, but she is very different from my ex, who I simped in a very different manner. Being of two different minds, a normie mind, I could not connect with my ex and thus together, not being able to simp for eachother, we were forced outside, forced to simp for the world.

We simped for birds.

We simped for Star Trek.

We simped for Bernie.

I think this was good. But we both deserve a mutual simping. There is no escape from the simp-tom. It did not work, the world is not enough, in its multiplicity, Freud knows this points to the true castration of the situation. Only variations on the symptomatic, the automatic simping of existence.

The simptomat, where one goes to clean everything and present to the other, a laudrymat of simp-tom. For the new lover, the woman who I see now, I present my old signifiers differently. When they cross up, I become momentarily aware, knowing that it has to go through the simptomat. The old simping which was not good enough has to be cleaned, regenerated for the new order.

What do I make of feminism now? This requires simp-tom-metrics. I have no idea how to calibrate this. Nothing satisfies the new girl, and it shouldn‚Äôt. She is lovely, and she is well read. She sees through my sophistry, and I can not help but to see through it too. What do I know of feminisms? When did I even need feminisms except as simp-tom. Feminism, through the simptomat, becomes something new, something forbidden from me. This is good, the universal feminism which I was allowed to access, the Trudeau feminism, simply was not powerful enough to warrant a field with potential radicality.

I like forbidden section feminism. Not ‚ÄúTERF‚Äù dom or whatever, but that there are large intricate weaves of the past where my blundering around in them has dire consequences.

I simp the girl hard, all things will bow to the simptomat. When one has nothing left to shitpost and spit out, one must light themselves on fire. One must throw themselves into the simptomat, for the new era.

Solitude: What escapes simptometrics

I work out, I also contain my insecurities. These insecurities are mine. The self-doubt, the self-hatred, the self-resentment, given to me by my family, the world, and of course most powerfully myself.

As I work with clients, I am tempted constantly to destroy the simptomatic functions which appear to first counteract their desires. I try to ‚Äúpoint the finger at your hole, if they are lucky you can get control.‚Äù (From an excellently titled indie rock song: ‚ÄúFuck Lacan and Also Freud‚Äù) To say my profession is an exact science would have to be a lie, since I am constantly throwing the simp-taghetti at the wall, seeing what will stick and what will fall off. I just present these most sacred of artifacts to the client themselves, and they see what works and what does not.

The mask which one does not show the outside, even when they do show the outside, it may not be the most real, but it certainly has a sticky quality to it. When simp-thomasaquinas is lying on his death bed, that is what has escaped the simptomat. The simptomatical and the devastatingly material and multiple fight each other for control through the fourth dimension. Time passes and one does not know where one will be pulled. Rationality takes a hold for a while, and seems to win, but suddenly, the world appears as simp-tom.

Would you simp a rock?

I‚Äôve seen a man simp a bug. Noted Horse Enthusiast and Music Professor Charles Rudig simps bugs and not horses.

A bug simper is cool, what can I simp?

The Difference Between Being Charming And Being An Ass.,"Yesterday I was out at a lounge listening to this girl I know DJ, she's also a girl I'm interested in. I just like her, she's got a cool personality, she's a little edgy, she's artistic, etc. She also creates her own music.

Anyway, so I'm chilling with some of her friends and she's playing her DJ set. At one point in the set she throws on a song that is actually hers, I notice this right away and get the idea to have some fun with it.

So I get up out of my seat and walk over to her booth and say to her

""Wow, this song is really dope, who's the artist?""

Of course, I knew it was her song.

She laughed and said ""It's mine.""

I said ""I know.""

Then we both had a moment, because she knew I was just being silly and having fun. 

After a few seconds I walked back over to the table with her friends.

So why do I write this?

Because what I did is an example of charm, being funny but also being friendly and making people feel good. That's what charm is.

I could have also went over and told her in a funny way that the song was bad and I wanted to know the artist because I hated it. Then when she gets mad, I say that I am just kidding.

That is NOT charming.

She does not feel good after that, a charming man makes a girl feel good which makes her feel comfortable around you.

Of course, one could argue that making fun of her is being a charming asshole and I disagree. In this case, you're just being a dick. You're telling her something that is close to her, something she's worked on is bad and even if you're kidding it's just not something you should joke about.

It's one thing to say to a girl that her shoes look silly.

But it's another to tell her that her art is bad, even if you're not being serious.

Imagine if you were told that something you worked hard on was bad?

It wouldn't feel good, even if it was a joke.

A charming man makes other feels GOOD, not BAD and he doesn't do it because he wants validation, he does it because he is a positive person and wants to bring others up.

Aka.

A leader.

"The Belief must precede the Action - DGAF is NOT an action, even though the best way you can convey it is through your actions; DGAF is a side effect of a Healthy Mental Model","DGAF merits some clarification, but what I'm about to say is limited to the introspection of my own experiences. I'm sure some commentators could chip in their own view on the matter.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Faking it till you make it**

So there you have it: outcome independence, confidence, DGAF. These holy grails that seem so hard to achieve, but once you get it and are able to internalize it, your life would be perfect and you would have no more problem dating girls and getting laid.

At least that's the idea I originally had. 

And so I tried the recommended way to do it: Faking the DGAF till you make it. I did this in every single interaction with women, carefully withdrawing my attention when ""they didn't deserve it"" and teased them when I thought the opportunity was right. On paper this seems like a good way to operate.

The issue with this is that you're emulating confidence and DGAF without actually believing it yourself. You're not DGAF for the sake of DGAF, you are DGAF for the sake of trying to bed this girl you're talking to. You're using DGAF as a tool to an end. **The belief does NOT precede the action.** So what you're really doing is abiding to a script that you're using whenever certain scenarios happen, and when given the opportunity, you open your toolbox, search for this tool called ""Don't Give a Fuck"", and use it in hopes that whatever she does goes to plan and moves you one step closer of nailing her.

I don't doubt this has worked for certain people, but it hasn't worked for me. 

I essentially became a full-time LARP who's actions did not match my intentions. Everything I did boiled down to that desired end result. The confidence and DGAF weren't real, and interactions with women felt like a chore. I wasn't enjoying myself.

[This](http://archive.vn/ioC3S) is what it looks like when you're operating this way. You tend to over-analyze everything, and are very cautious as to not make any false steps.

It didn't help that women could sniff the fake outta me as time progressed. The ROI was really low.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Giving your fucks to something better**

I closed that first chapter and labeled it unsuccessful. But even though things didn't work out, it was a great reference point that taught me an important lesson: **that I could be operating in a certain way for a long time, and still be wrong.** During that phase, I never considered an alternative plan. In my deluded sense of self, that's what I thought true confidence and DGAF was. But it sure wasn't. 

A conclusion I came to was that **LARPing helped me suppress many aspects of myself out of the fear of being judged.** And so, I decided to take a deeper dive and understand who I was, and more importantly why I wanted to conceal certain aspects from others, especially women.

I didn't really know how to start, so I decided to consult some TRP recommended literature. I started with No More Mr. Nice Guy (NMMNG) and Models. And while I didn't feel like I initially got much out of theme, these books have aged extremely well for me, and have been the catalysts to my inner change.

I'll spare you the details, but thanks to NMMNG, I started attending a safe space for men to discuss their problems. It is a judgment-free space, where we support each other while holding each other accountable. Through that group, I started talking very honestly about myself, with no filters and no sugar-coating. I talked about the Red Pill, my LARP phase, my relationship with my parents, everything. These group sessions were the cornerstone to my effort on becoming a more honest man.

And with my weekly exposure, I learned to become more and more genuine, **a trait I couldn't attain while I had the pressure to hide certain things about myself.** And with the positive reinforcement I was getting from the group, I started opening up to other people about things I'd normally conceal. I started sharing my issues with my mother, then my close friends, and so on. The more I did so, the more I became comfortable with being honest. Models equally reinforced this notion.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

During the first chapter, my belief system was outcome-oriented. I needed to see results, and without any, my sense of self-worth would take a hit. So it was completely normal for me to heavily rely on the outcome, because it was the value I measured myself up to. *If I don't have sex with this girl tonight, then I'm a loser!*

Nowadays, my belief system has changed; it is now to be honest. Because being honest alleviates me from the need to hide anything from other people. Being honest enforces the fact that I must own up to all aspects of myself, weaknesses and strengths. Being honest means that in the eyes of other people, I may seem like someone who doesn't have life figured out, who doesn't bang models on the regular, who doesn't make a six figures salary, but who's totally fine with those. **And being honest may be painful, but it's a pain I've chosen to suffer for, because only then can I truly be myself.**

Now, given any dating situation, my honesty is more important than the outcome. I make an active effort to avoid concealing any information that I think would hurt me. And it just so happens that sometimes, whenever I'm being honest, it appears that I am confident and/or DGAF. Because those are a side effect of me owning up to everything I say. **The belief precedes the actions.**

Maybe some women won't like for it, and they can fuck right off. If they don't value honesty, we probably wouldn't have been a good match in the first place.

I still sometimes struggle to maintain this, mainly because the remnants of my previous chapter would sometimes show up. I sometimes still feel like I cannot be vulnerable. But as I become more assertive with my honesty, I feel much less the need to bend to anyone.

When others say that they DGAF because ""they just want to have fun"", although I can't relate, I think the underlying belief is the same. The end goal is not manipulated wit fake behaviors of DGAF, it's the acknowledgement that they aren't pressured to be some way, **because they value having fun to be more important than getting laid.** And girls are attracted to that good, genuine energy.

So it totally makes sense when others say: *by not giving a fuck about getting laid, I got laid!* But that's only partially true; in order to DGAF about that, you must first GAF about something else, moreso than you care about getting laid. In my case, it's honesty, in others' case, it's having fun.

What will it be for you?

Now, you might say that being honest all the time is bad. Maybe I'm wrong. But I haven't seen the consequences of it yet, and if I do, I'll simply teach myself to calibrate effectively.

And maybe my post won't resonate with you. That unfortunately means that you'll have to figure it out for yourself, because as I mentioned in the beginning, I am only speaking through the observation of my own experiences.",43,1

Women Have a Mental Scoresheet for their Sources of Attention,"TL;DR at the bottom

Back when I worked retail, I was cool with a female coworker (HB6). I had long since learned the lesson of not dipping your pen in the company ink (even in a trivial job like retail) by then and was not interested in her in that way, mainly because she was 18, but looked like she was 15. But, as a foreign chick, who had only been in the country for 2 years, she was not yet completely consumed by American culture, and was cool to make small talk with to pass the time at work. This girl already had a habit of making it clear that she needed attention, because if we were working the same shift, she would essentially, stare at me from afar repeatedly throughout the entire shift until I said ""hi"" to her and conversed with her. Sometimes she would just tired of waiting and ask rhetorically ""you're not gonna say hi?"".  Considering how girls I knew already asked that same rhetorical question in the past, I brushed it off as a woman being a woman. Now, what **did** surprise me was what happened when I  returned from vacation in Africa. I'm the type of person who has instances, (typically a few days a week), where I don't feel like talking to most people (if not, anyone).  Basically I like my ""me"" time, even at work. When I returned to work from vacation, I was in one of those ""me time"" periods. I think I only really spoke to one homie from work. During those first few days, she did her usual ""I'm going to stare at you until you talk to me"" spiel, but I was just in my zone and figured she'd eventually get it. Nothing against her. Just too lazy to talk to people. 

On our 2nd or 3rd day working the same shift, she went up to me in the break room when I had just clocked out for lunch and the conversation went like this:

Girl- We need to talk 

Me- I'm on lunch 

\*she follows me to the Dunkin' Donuts inside the retail store, waits for me to finish getting my food, and follows me to the seats and sits down across from me\*

Girl- I want to know what happened to you.

Me- What are you talking about?

Girl- What did I do to you?

Me- You didn't do anything. I just came back from another continent. There's no way you could've done anything bad to me.

Girl- Then why aren't you talking to me anymore?! What did I doooooo? 

Me- Huh?  Listen to me. You. Didn't. Do. Anything. 

\*She proceeds to ask ""what did I do?"" 3-5 times with me having no clue what she's talking about\*

Girl- You're going to make me cry again. (Gotta love crocodile tears). 

Me- Again?

\*She shows me a message thread from the previous night between her and a coworker she rejected, in which she complained about how I was making her cry and she couldn't sleep because I was not talking to her.\* (Mark him down as one of her emotional tampons)

At this point, I wanted to make up some excuse for my lack of speaking to her, so that we could ""resolve it"", so that I could finish my lunch and avoid making a scene lol. And that's what I did. The conversation ended with her saying ""I know your lunch ends at 4:46. I'm always watching you""; My weirded out reaction that followed said it all. 

This conversation happened during a time where several guys at work were trying to get with her, in addition to her having plenty of attention from her orbiter that she friend zoned **and** her brand new boyfriend. I figured that would be enough attention for her, but nope. Piggybacking off of my very first post on this sub, women have an intuition about them in which they immediately know when a source of attention is dwindling. And they will do some pretty odd things to get that source of attention back. I'm definitely not even doing the ""small talk"" thing with female coworkers again after that. The side bar is undefeated. Keep grinding fellas. 

TL;DR: female coworker confronted me at and had a meltdown because I didn't feel like making small talk for a couple days. Yikes.",45,1

What a whole year of TRP does to you ‚Äì how I slept with my first MILF,"**What a whole year of TRP does to you ‚Äì how I slept with my first MILF**

**Summary**

After more than a whole year of working on my frame, my physical appearance and my game (Part one), I applied every single TRP tool I had to seduce and bed a MILF (Part two : field report).

**Body**

**Part One : Background and TRP journey**

Some years ago, I \[at the time 22 years of age, now nearing 24 at the time of writing\] was a blue pill boy who had finally escaped from of a failed LTR, coming to terms with the fact that I was responsible for the failure : I had not been able to set boundaries, I had feared conflict, I had let my really sweet, but overly dependent GF take control of my life ‚Äì even though I‚Äôd never seen myself as the kind of guy who‚Äôd let that happen.

In reality, I was a ¬´ nice guy ¬ª (as described by Robert Glover) in most areas of life : I considered my needs and wants to be secondary ‚Äì I was an ‚Äúaltruist‚Äù who prided himself on being low maintenance. If there was only a serving of pasta left, I‚Äôd be the first to give it up to one of my friends. At the time, I didn‚Äôt know that all the frustration and rage I felt on a regular basis, were only the consequence of this ¬´ selfless ¬ª myth I had bought into ‚Äì I honestly believed that being good was solely about making others happy, even if that meant making myself unhappy (how I‚Äôve changed‚Ä¶).

When I discovered TRP, I quickly recognised the truth I had been seeking. I had always been keen on self-improvement, but it was the first time that I‚Äôd come across such a powerful and nuanced philosophy. Usually, self-improvement gurus tell you to love yourself and others, be more kind, selfless‚Ä¶ etc. Which I‚Äôm sure is good advice if you‚Äôre a selfish cunt ‚Äì but is terrible advice for ‚Äúselfless‚Äù (actually spineless) ‚Äúnice guys‚Äù. TRP was the first self-improvement philosophy to show me that harnessing my power was the best thing I could do, not only for others, but also, and mainly, for myself. Having desires and life energy is what makes you an accomplished, healthy, optimistic person, NOT taming your power, which is wasteful, as well as dangerous (the energy will turn itself against you in unpredictable and unhealthy ways if you don‚Äôt let it out). TRP helped me understand that women (just like men btw), want carefree, light-hearted fun. They want adventure, they like mystery and surprise. **They just can‚Äôt advertise it** ‚Äì because that would attract too many idiots, because they‚Äôd be called sluts‚Ä¶ etc.

So I worked. I started lifting. I started working on my frame (I am the prize, I am just here to have fun and go about my mission, I have abundance‚Ä¶ etc). I worked on my physical appearance (I cut my long hair, I started wearing shirts more frequently‚Ä¶). I kept a journal where I recorded my experiences and analysed them (turning each failure into a lesson). I experimented with NoFap (which boosted my self-confidence and general drive).

On a deep level, it is my frame that changed the most. My whole worldview has shifted. Its funny, I only got around to read NMMNG a few days ago ‚Äì I could see my old blue pill self, but also the amount of progress I‚Äôd made. Staggering stuff. I understand now that my struggle with women was just the tip of the ¬´ nice guy ¬ª iceberg. I‚Äôm so glad to have been freed.

**Part Two : when TRP becomes second nature ‚Äì field report**

I‚Äôm telling this story because that evening, I used every single TRP tool I have ever learned. And I did it without even thinking.

**Prologue**

‚ÄúHey bro, I‚Äôd be really glad if you came to my mother‚Äôs big annual party this year‚Äù, said my very good friend Mo‚Äô the other day. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs over in \[other city\], and there will be only old middle-aged geezers, why the fuck should we go?‚Äù, I asked. ‚ÄúFuck you man, who cares about age, as long as people know how to party? Do it for me at least, I‚Äôd like you to come since I‚Äôm going anyway‚Äù. This friend, Mo‚Äô, really likes to party, and he‚Äôs exceptionally good at it (yes, it‚Äôs a skill), so I let myself get convinced, and I said, as a joke because I didn‚Äôt really believe it myself : ‚ÄúWell, your mom‚Äôs friends better be hot, because I‚Äôm not going there for nothing !‚Äù. Needless to say, that joke suddenly became real funny a few days later.

And with that, off we went.

**The party**

We finally get there, and the party seems kinda shit, we‚Äôre the youngest ones around by far, and the geezers, who seem to average 40-50 yo are just talking and eating in a small cramped apartment. ‚ÄúFuck‚Äù I can‚Äôt help but mutter. Mo‚Äô doesn‚Äôt care ‚Äì he‚Äôs talking to everyone, laughing, and just having a good time as he always does. Now, I‚Äôm not as skilled as he is, but I‚Äôm trying my best at being fun and entertaining. While doing this, I spot a woman who looks in her early forties, blond hair, green eyes, nice legs, real sexy smile. A proper MILF, former HB9 no doubt about it.

Now, she‚Äôs sitting in a corner, in deep conversation. Unlike the other middle-aged women who keep eyeing me (I‚Äôm looking good, I‚Äôve got a nice white shirt with the sleeves curled up, a clean cut and shave, and all the lifting has brought about tasty results), my target doesn‚Äôt give a shit. You can tell, by her looks and her demeanour, that she used to be a real pretty girl, who‚Äôd get tons of attention from boys ‚Äì and probably still does.

As time passes, I get to meet her (let‚Äôs call her Jennifer), and a small group of ‚Äúfun‚Äù people forms around Mo‚Äô and me. Jokes start to fly, people start to dance. I‚Äôm teasing Jennifer, who responds very strongly ‚Äì a lot stronger than needed actually, that‚Äôs how I know I have an opening. Even another woman notices this ‚Äì ‚Äúthese two can‚Äôt stand each other!‚Äù she exclaims. So I keep at it, teasing, push-pulling, but also sometimes stopping the act and going for a ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to get to know you‚Äù vibe, in a more intimate manner. I then go to dance, insisting that I‚Äôm a shit dancer, which is untrue, and fake being shit at dancing for a while, till I start throwing a few moves which illicit reactions from people around. Suddenly, Jennifer, who‚Äôd stayed sat, saying she hated dancing, is on the dancefloor, and it is quite clear that she got up because of me. And so that‚Äôs how things went on for the rest of the night : teasing, dancing, talking, till eventually, there were only very few people left, and it was obviously time for her to go.

**The close**

This is where it gets interesting. Teasing, dancing and looking good aren‚Äôt that hard to do, and I‚Äôd been doing that since way before I discovered TRP (TRP just helped me further improve my looks and game, which I had already worked on quite a lot). What TRP really taught me, is frame, as well as female psychology (‚Äúwatch her actions not her words‚Äù, shit-tests‚Ä¶ etc). These are the most precious TRP lessons, because they are counterintuitive (whereas looking good, making a girl laugh, not being needy‚Ä¶ all are pretty self-evident requirements if you ask me).

So she‚Äôs about to leave, and Mo‚Äô pulls me aside ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care how you do it, but I don‚Äôt want to see you sleeping here tonight‚Äù (I was supposed to sleep in his room). Till that moment, I was relaxed, but suddenly I‚Äôm all tense : I have no idea how to get her to invite me to her house.

She says goodbye to everyone, and I‚Äôm hovering by the front door. Finally she comes to me (all that follows happens very fast) : ‚ÄúGoodbye, it was nice meeting you‚Äù she says. I don‚Äôt know what to do, so I just throw it out there : ‚ÄúWhat are we gonna do now? You‚Äôve been hitting on me all night and you‚Äôre just gonna leave like this?‚Äù She can‚Äôt believe I just said that, but laughs : ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been hitting on you at all! You have!‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúSure I have‚Ä¶ Normally I‚Äôd ask for your number, but I don‚Äôt even live in this city, so what‚Äôs the point?‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou want my number?‚Äù she asks, genuinely surprised. ‚ÄúAt the very least, but as I said, what am I to do with it?‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou can always come back to this city‚Äù she suggests ‚Äì ‚ÄúAlright but I don‚Äôt have my phone on me, so I can‚Äôt take note‚Äù (my phone was charging in the next room, I hadn‚Äôt thought it‚Äôd go this quickly). ‚ÄúThen you‚Äôll have to memorize it !‚Äù she laughs. As she dictates the number, she opens the door, and slips out. The door closes, and I‚Äôve obviously not memorized the number, since I didn‚Äôt give a shit about it in the first place.

In a flash, it seemed all over. I‚Äôm standing in front of a closed door, with nothing to show for all the work I put in that evening, for all the IOIs I‚Äôd gotten from her, for all the training I‚Äôd been following for a year. I had been meditating every day, had gotten very good at penetrating the present and not overthinking my decisions. I had built myself a pretty solid frame, in which I am the prize. I had lifted religiously three times a week. But suddenly, it looked as if it had been all for nothing.

It seemed all over, but I could *feel* that it was not.

In just a split-second, the training kicked in.

It takes control of my body, and without even thinking, I open the door. She‚Äôs there, waiting for the elevator to come. I step out of the apartment and close the door behind me, without realising that I have just shut off the only source of light in the corridor. I find myself in complete darkness, with the image of Jennifer still printed on my retina. My body is still in charge, I‚Äôm deep inside the present moment and my usually talkative, overthinking brain is turned completely off. I don‚Äôt have time to think, my body starts walking to the spot where I saw Jennifer, I take her in my arms, and kiss her.

The doors to the lift open, and she breaks the kiss. ‚ÄúWow, you young ones are pretty daft aren‚Äôt you ? Goodbye then, this is where it stops‚Äù. But I‚Äôm on autopilot now, I‚Äôm responding to unconscious cues, I can just *feel* that this is not the end. ‚ÄúSure, it stops here‚Äù I say, while at the same time stepping into the elevator. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not coming with me‚Äù she insists ‚Äì ‚ÄúOf course not !‚Äù I insist, stepping out of the elevator with her. We‚Äôre in the street now, and she‚Äôs laughing and saying that I must turn back, and I keep agreeing with her while doing the opposite of what I‚Äôm saying. We come to her car, she gets in. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not coming in‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never get in such a dirty car anyway‚Äù, while walking around to the passenger side.

As I‚Äôm doing this, I know that this is the critical point of no return, and that I might run into some real resistance if she‚Äôs serious about not taking me home. But just as I mentally prep for a potential rejection, I see her extend her arm and unlock the passenger door from inside. *Watch her actions, not her words*. So I get in. She looks at me, with a half surprised, half amused look on her face. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not sleeping together tonight‚Äù she insists ‚Äì ‚ÄúOf course not ! I just want to have a cup of tea, why‚Äôd you have to be thinking about sex all the time ?‚Äù I answer. She laughs, but mainly to herself ‚Äì ‚Äú\[Mo‚Äôs mum\] is gonna make fun of me for weeks‚Ä¶‚Äù she sighs, shaking her head, but with the slight, amused smile still on her face.

And with that, she starts the car.

I didn‚Äôt have my phone with me, I didn‚Äôt know the city at all, I didn‚Äôt know this 40 years old woman, but off we went, into the darkness, to her house. You can guess the rest. She later told me I was by far the youngest man she‚Äôd been with, relatively speaking.

**Lessons learned**

* **Want what you want**. People most often don‚Äôt know what they want, and are just waiting for someone who already wants something to convince them of getting onboard with them. Just as Mo‚Äô convinced me to come with him to his mother‚Äôs party, I convinced Jennifer to take me home. To convince someone, you must show, loud and clear, your own persuasion. The shit-tests/ASD I had to pass through were sincere. You could tell that she didn‚Äôt expect to take me home. She didn‚Äôt see herself coming home with a guy as young as I, so she needed convincing : exactly like I didn‚Äôt see myself going to a middle-aged party in another city. Mo‚Äô convinced me by showing me his will and conviction that it would be fun, I convinced Jennifer by showing her my will, and conviction that we would have fun.
* **Actions, not words**. During the whole duration of the close, not once did I speak ‚Äúthe truth‚Äù. Everything single word I uttered was contradicted by my very actions. I kept on repeating I was not going home with her, that she was the one who had shamelessly hit on me‚Ä¶ In a way, this helped me get into the ‚Äúwatch her actions, not her words‚Äù frame of mind. Words didn‚Äôt convey meaning anymore, I was emptying them of any power over me, by actively acting against them. I didn‚Äôt realise it at the time, but this technique is extremely powerful. You convince her, as well as yourself, that you are the prize, while at the same time weakening any words she might say against you, since words have lost meaning.
* **NoFap has a definitely strong effect on me**. I cannot speak for everyone, but I must admit that restraining from masturbation is doing wonders for my self-confidence and general drive. It‚Äôs hard to explain, and it might be a placebo effect, but it definitely feels like all the energy I‚Äôm keeping in, is finding other ways to get out. When I stepped out the door of the apartment to find Jessica, it had been 2 months since my last orgasm. I am convinced that the energy I had stored up is what pushed me to walk up to her and just go in for a kiss : I‚Äôm usually a pretty confident guy, but not that much. *If you lack self-confidence and general drive*, I would definitely recommend you try 90 days without porn and masturbation, and even if you have a girl at the moment, that you restrain from climaxing at all (look into tantric sex if you have a girl).
* **Rejection is better than regret**. That one‚Äôs a classic, but I have to write it down again. Man, when I found myself in front of the closed door, I was so frustrated‚Ä¶ I could already feel the night of regret that awaited me if I turned around and accepted the situation. All these failures that I had experienced in the past because I had pussied out, are what stung me out of my stupor, and pushed me to open the door.
* **Surround yourself with energetic, charismatic people**. You might have noticed that Mo‚Äô played a role at every stage of this story. He pushed me to come with him, he showed me that one could have fun even in such an apparently desolate setting, and finally, he pushed me out of the door by forbidding me to stay over. He is one of my greatest friends, and I have learned so much around him I can hardly imagine who I would be today if we hadn‚Äôt met.
* **TRP changed my life for the better**, and I‚Äôm only just starting. I still have much to learn, but I can already say : TRP turned my life around. So **thank you**.",171,1

Fuck a cuck,"Do NOT let your girl post thotty fucking photos on her insta. Do NOT have the mentality of ‚Äúwell she comes home to me‚Äù or ‚Äúshe needs her freedom‚Äù. You sit back while your girl disgustingly finds validation by making her body visually available via thirst traps for simps? Those pictures should be for YOUR eyes only. Don‚Äôt let her fool you with the classic ‚ÄúI post it for myself‚Äù remark. If it was truly for herself and not others she‚Äôd keep it in the camera roll where it belongs. You don‚Äôt go to the forest with a hunting rifle if you don‚Äôt plan on hunting. You don‚Äôt dress for the weather if it‚Äôs not going to rain. You don‚Äôt post thotty fucking pics unless you plan on being validated by OTHER MEN and want OTHER MEN in your DMs. There isn‚Äôt much of a difference between having your girl model for a bunch of staring men in her bedroom and posting thotty fucking pics on social media. Are you going to allow her to cuck you? Or are you going to stand up for your masculinity and keep boundaries true and dear? If she wants those pics posted, YOU post your trophy.

Ramblings of a 24 year old who slept with over 35 girls," 

Please before taking this post even a bit seriously,overcome the ego of yours and bear with me as i'm not bragging. My only intention is to contribute to this unique community of like-minded people.

To start off,i was basically the stereotypical kid red-pillers were,overprotective mother and absent father(whom i greatly respect and love for his sacrifices for me). Chubby,never bullied at school but more often than not i was a target for many people,i never intended to harm anyone first,not even those who harassed me,not because of weakness,i realised that after i got developed and blah blah,but because of seeing no point in it. Girls as you can imagine liked(or were just okay with) my presence but i was never special,invited or wanted. My first relationship was at 18 with a girl i tattooed her name with small letters(this got covered up of course,point at me and laugh,ikr).Fast forward to 2020,after she broke up with me in 2016 who was my first sexual partner,i have slept with over 35 girls,even lost count. How did a guy that was basically invisible,aggreeable and weak become Zen?There are many ways this subreddit recommends for building power,most of them are centered around women,why is that?Sleeping with many **attractive** women is probably the fastest and most efficient way to reach the no-mind,what people are born to chase in their lives,and for women to chase those men,or at least the ones closer to that state. Women are to be included to a reality due to their feminine nature,while men are to create realities,with alphas creating the most ""natural"" thus nearly ideal ones. Whenever i read red-pill posts,never been an active red-piller,i actually confirm my own actions,thoughts and ways of thinking getting some validation. How do you translate that? While the red-pill is a good place to widen your knowledge and correct some details,you won't achieve anything whatsoever copying or trying to imitate what is discussed here. That has to come out of you naturally,in a very calm way,heck you should even pick yourself everytime you're acting or faking anything. Until now i thought that my ego-death breakthrough dmt trip changed everything and made me a clear headed person without an inner voice and complete free will,but recently i realized that it was just a very powerfull tool to become ""armed"" with all that knowledge that will make you a jedi lover(really liked that term,saw it on red-pill) . Plus that you will be aware of yourself in a much more consciouss way. Damn,that applies to reality as a whole,too. There is no need to demonize dopamine and say it's the neurotransmitter's fault that people stay on the pc and slam their meat all day. Nor to start hiking,rafting or some extreme sport to ""become"" or ""seem"" interesting or push your limits or whatever. Everything you need to reach a natural abundance mindset without trying to is inside you. To be honest,the more you try to get something,whatever it might be,the more it's whole existence will be repelled from you(saying existence because i include both it's physical precense and your ideas about it). If you're a cunning,strong and *good-at-it* man,you'll surely end up a powerful figure,or at least seemingly powerful. But your power will be limited by human limits. It will tend to reach perfection but will never reach it,which is the transcedental states discussed in many philosophies,cults,religions or whatever gateways to spirituality. As women get shaped by their sexual intercourses,so do men. But nobody ever discusses that why? It's a tricky subject,you can have sex with many women as a fit and successful or whatever guy but the flaw is that even if they are attractive women,the man must form a deeper connection in order for that woman to count in his actual,character-shaping and not degrading(works like with women) experiences.A good portion of your n-counter is just the bucket list. It's random girls that we just slept with,and even those who had a relationship with us were just taking it just a bit deeper,nothing serious. It's when you start to *want* to seduce her,make her feel at home,water her existence. Those experiences are of much greater value and will help you add up great on achieving natural calmness. LTR for me is a no-no,anything that is of possessive nature will either rot away,or be tolerable *at best.* You don't have to fake or hide your feelings,you need to have them under control. You don't have to act on anything,or play by the 48 laws of power constantly. Those laws come out of you naturally once you're in the Zen state. Seek,everyday.What you like naturally is a call for further deepening. Search inside of you. The outside is merely an instrument to help you dig inside your consciousness and existence. Julius Evola has good writings on that if anyone's interested. A good book i recommend is Introduction to Magic,i wouldn't recommend that to beginners. Having an abundance mindset is not a trick to be abundant,not having a mindset is an outcome of being abundant,which is an outcome of being abundant. That sounds retarded but your mentality is totally correlated with your reality. It's a ""loop"" between mentality and reality. For example,humans seek calmness by chasing abundance in reality but they will never reach that because you can never be abundant. Human could have the whole fucking planet and he would still want the nearest one,too. Abundance will come to you once you're calm. When you have no needs,you act in the most natural way possible. Whatever is naturally ""connected"" to you,like like-minded girls,will come to you,end of story. Even if a girl is a fucking goddess but has nothing in common mentally with you,YOU will be the one to reject her,but if you act that way she wouldn't probably even dare to come close to you. Do whatever it takes to make a big **actual** N-count. It matters so much but it's so extremely rare that it's not at all talked about,at least in society. It's an alien term to almost everyone. The bucket list is merely the first step,and it takes quite a bit effort to raise it enough to proceed to the actual list. Sleeping with many attractive **to you** women will make you love yourself,while anything else that is non-human will give you a big ego and vanity. I'm just some random 24 year old dude doing sketchy shit,no car,no job,dropped out of college,have lots of tattoos but not too extreme,and even old ladies treat me politely. Search inside you,be aware of the ego,do some modifications to your reality no matter how hard they are and thigs will come naturally to you. Sorry for the post my stimulated fellows would expect to read,i'm a perceiver and being organized is a bit tormenting to me,so bear with it. Would really like to hear your thoughts and do some constructive dialogue,i'm writing this because i think i can drop some insights to you and maybe you can do that to me.",20,1

"I celebrated my ex LTR's birthday today, she changed a lot after the breakup","She was a very traditional girl, her family and she was pretty religious and she had a nice face but not too good. Wasn't too active on social media. Never posted a sexual picture etc etc. Doesn't put on make-up. These were the factors that made me decide to LTR her. 


I just entered into an LTR with her at a bad time in my life without vetting her as a plate for a long time, I was pretty suicidal and in depression because of one of my family members dying and a sickness. 


After a while I entered into an LTR with her, she started disrespecting me all of a sudden. I was so depressed that I'd let these slide and go get busy with my own business at the time, then I'd come back later. She disrespected me every single day, naturally I kind of started despising her. She looked good from outside: traditional, religious, good family, she didn't have any lovers in the past and I was the one who took her virginity, even when she was 25 years old, very close to wall. 



I didn't notice her red flags early-on. She was virgin, not because she was religious, but because she was a crazy bitch who drove men away. She had a pretty masculine personality, and a narcissist, also BPD. She was disrespectful, pretty bitchy, never accepted her mistakes, prudish... She was a walking example of ""who you shouldn't have a relationship with"" 



She irritated me each time I had a conversation with her, my gut told me to leave her but I didn't listen to it. 




Anyway, relationship went really really sour. It became pretty much a game to upset each other every time we talked. Making each other sad was the only reason we talked and we succeeded a lot at that. 



She knew I was suicidal, so one day she just told me to go kill myself and that was the worst day of my life. I grew violent, so I hit one of my old plates up and I went to her place. Almost couldn't even get my member up because of how sad I was, but I managed to do it and I fucked her. It wasn't really anything special but she seemed to have enjoyed it a lot because that sex was literally the most violent sex of my whole life. I took a selfie on the bed and I just waited. 


What was I going to do? Was I going to send it to her to upset her and let our little games continue? 



And I decided. I decided that I was going to break up with her. Me having sex with another girl that day affected my decision a lot because those months were pretty shaky times in my life. I broke up with her, blocked her from everywhere. The next day after I made the selfie my Twitter pfp, which she stalks a lot and she verbally made it obvious that she stalked me in the past, like ""why did you follow her?"". So I was sure that she was going to see it, I left my pfp like that for a few days, then I shut down that account altogether and opened a new, anonymous account. and I came back to the old ways of TRP. 




Started meditating, lifting, spinning plates, cold showers, working my ass off each day. I fucked the most number of women I fucked in a month that month. Moving on is pretty quick when you fuck a lot of other women.



Today was that girl's birthday, I can just hear you saying ""Why are you even celebrating it?"", but I just thought it could be fun to get her reaction. So I just type in her Instagram nickname and unblock her. First thing I see is her number of followers have just skyrocketed and she made her account public. I scrolled down to look at her pictures and I saw that she started posting sexual photos, putting on make-up, and she started using social media very actively. I was literally shocked at what I saw. Her family was religious, she was religious, she never did these.  



I guess all it takes to break a woman is one really toxic relationship and an emotional rollercoaster that left her at the bottom. She was already a toxic and disturbing person, so she must've been left alone by others too. She was literally broken. 





I sent her a text, and conversation followed:


Me: Happy birthday :) 

Her: Today is not my birthday. It was 2 months ago.


Her: You know what? You should be happy that I replied to you jackass 

Her: I thought I could trust you, and you did all those and left me


And I just block her again at this point. I guess I didn't remember her birthday correctly. 



TL;DR: I got in a toxic relationship, we fucked each other over. I recovered from it, it fucked her up and she went from trad girl to an attention whore (and a possibly a real whore). I guess all it takes is only one toxic relationship to break a girl. And she replied to me even though I really made her sad, that leaves the room open for alpha widow even though I wasn't really 'that alpha', just had the upper hand. Now I'm happy finally, and she looks like she is not gonna be happy at anytime soon. One other thing to note, if you are depressed seek treatment, not a relationship.",4,1
Escape the Feminine Imperative: Stop Being a Bitch and Value Yourself.,"*‚ÄúEverything a man experiences, every social conditioning he receives from the earliest age, every accepted social norm and every expectation of him is to qualify as the definition of a mature adult Man in contemporary society is designed to serve a female imperative.‚Äù - Rollo Tomassi*  


**The instant you came out of your mother‚Äôs vagina with a full set of cock and balls was the day the entire world was dead-set on cutting off your dick and turning it into a pussy to get fucked by fat dykes with strap-ons.**

If you‚Äôve taken the red pill, chances are you took it because you got cucked following all the bullshit advice we‚Äôve been fed by a world eating the yeast-infected pussy of a fat short-haired feminist moaning cries of equality and the *glass ceiling.*

*JuSt Be YoUrSelF BrO! JuSt Be A NiCe GuY AnD You‚ÄôLL GeT ThE GiRl!* 

You‚Äôre told while your oneitis gets her back blown out by the dude who doesn‚Äôt even know her name.


*AlL GiRlS WaNt A NiCe GuY!* 

You‚Äôre told while you‚Äôre rejected over and over again by girls who saw you as a ‚Äúfriend.‚Äù

*GEt HeR FlOwErS!*  

You‚Äôre told while the girl you gave the flowers to sees you as a creep.

*LoOk FoR YoUr SoUl MatE!* 

Disney sings to you through the screen while you silently think of the princess and pittance you‚Äôve been promised

I could go on, but you get the gist; you‚Äôve been fed emasculating bullshit and you‚Äôre sick and tired of it.  

We‚Äôre *all* sick and tired of it. 

If you want to be a part of the solution and not the problem, it‚Äôs really fucking simple. 


**Stop being a massive bitch and value yourself.**

There is nothing more dangerous to the feminine imperative than a man that values himself and refuses to be a pussywhipped faggot. 


What does a man that values himself look like? 

It's simple; a man that values himself is a **selfish man.** 

A man that does what he does because he wants to do it, and not what he's *told* to do by a world that doesn't give a fuck about him and wants to see him emasculated and weak in order to better serve the very system that took his balls away in the first place. 

He doesn't bend over backward for a woman in order to be ""chivalrous."" He only helps women who help him and gives him what he wants, and even then sparingly. 

He doesn't support causes just to fit in and earn social status, he supports only what aligns with himself and his interests. 

He doesn't avoid necessary conflict. He willingly stands up for himself and what he wants even if it'll piss others off. 

Lastly, he values himself and judges himself based on whether or not he's earned his own self-respect.

If you really wanna change the world and destroy the feminine imperative we're all in, stop being a fucking cuck and learn to be selfish and inspire others to do the same.  

*A tan, abs, hideously expensive yoga pants, coffee made by other people, a meticulously trimmed beard, the politically-correct demeanor ‚Äì all are affectations designed to improve your stock with other people. They lack intrinsic value, since any value they impart to you is assigned externally. People who depend on value assigned to them by others are obviously in a perpetually vulnerable position. They are fragile, in more than a physical sense. - Mark Rippetoe*

The Laws,"All interactions in the Universe are governed by basic fundamental forces. 

Whether you're a disciple of Hermetic teachings, an ancient Gnostic follower, an Atheist man of science, or a new age believer of Quantum Mechanics, you will agree that the universe -- our reality -- is governed by Laws.

***

**THE LAW OF CAUSE AND EFFECT**

Everything happens for a reason. For every cause there is an effect, and for every effect, whether you know it or not, there is a specific cause or causes.

There are no accidents.

**THE LAW OF MIND**

All causation is mental. Your thoughts become your realities. Your thoughts are creative. You become what you think about most of the time.

Think continually about the things you really want, and refuse to think about the things you do not want.

Whatever you visualize clearly and emotionally will materialize in your world.

You can have anything you want in life if you can first decide exactly what it is, and then do the things that have done to achieve the same result.

A mind divided and distracted is a mind conquered -- a mind focused and determined is a mind free.

**THE LAW OF CORRESPONDENCE**

Your outer life is a reflection of your inner life. There is a direct correspondence between the way you think and feel on the inside and the way you act and experience on the outside.

The world around you is an out picturing of the world within you. The images you dwell upon affect your thoughts, feelings and behavior.

Your relationships, health, wealth and position are minor images of your inner world.

**THE LAW OF BELIEF**

Whatever you believe, with feeling, becomes your reality. You do not believe what you see; you see what you have already chosen to believe.

You must identify, then remove the self-limiting beliefs that hold you back.

**THE LAW OF VALUES**

You always act in a manner consistent with your innermost values and convictions.

What you say and do, the choices you make -especially under stress or in the face of conflict- are an exact expression of who you are and what you truly value, regardless of what you say.

If you watch movies/play video games and think you're some kind of heroic badass, then run with your tail between your legs at the first sign of danger or confrontation, then that is what you value and who you truly are.

**THE LAW OF DESIRE**

Everything you do or say is triggered by your inner desires, drives and instincts. These may be conscious or unconscious.

Demanding is the process of wanting something that cannot happen or will not exist. Demand gives birth to desire. In order to determine your true desires, you must have experienced your demands going unmet. A baby who is given everything they demand will never know desire.

The great thing about desire, is that it is formed on the premise that it is attainable for you, and once obtained that old desire is replaced with a new one.

The key to success is to set your own goals and determine your own motivations through what you desire.


**THE LAW OF CHOICE**

Your life is the sum total of all your choices up to this present minute.

Since you are always free to choose what you think about, you are in complete control of your life and everything that happens to you.

**THE LAW OF OPPORTUNITY**

Your greatest possibilities will often come from the most common situations around you.

Your biggest opportunity probably lies under your own feet, in your current city, industry, education, experience, hobbies or interests.

**THE LAW OF PURPOSE**

Definitiveness of purpose is the starting point of all wealth. To become wealthy, you must decide exactly what you want, obsess over it, and then make a plan for its accomplishment. 

All successful people ""think on paper.""

**THE LAW OF COMMITMENT**

The quality of love and the duration of a relationship are in direct proportion to the depth of the commitment by *both* people to making the relationship successful.

Commit yourself wholeheartedly and unconditionally to the most important people in your life that prove their own dedication to you.

Reflect the amount of commitment you receive from your romantic partnerships or platonic friendships.

Never over commit. This is why men who devote themselves to a woman who has already emotionally / mentally checked out is a recipe for disaster.


**THE LAW OF COMPENSATION**

You will be compensated in full for everything you do. You will get out what you put in. 

Half efforts are met with half results. When you lift a weight with intense determination, you will grow in strength and size. When you swing a weight mindlessly, you will only ask yourself ""why cant I get bigger."" 

**THE LAW OF OPTIMISM**

A positive mental attitude is essential for success and happiness in every area of life.

Your attitude is an expression of your values, beliefs and expectations.

**THE LAW OF CHANGE**

Change is inevitable. Because it is driven by expanding knowledge and technology, it is accelerating at a speed never seen before.

Your job is to be a master of change rather than a victim of change.

This is the beauty of the Red Pill - by taking it you will learn how to thrive in a constantly changing society / sexual market place.

**THE LAW OF HAPPINESS**

The quality of your life is determined by how you feel at any given moment. How you feel is determined by how you interpret what is happening around you, not by the events themselves.

It's never too late to have a happy memory. At any time, you can go back and change the way you interpret those experiences to yourself.

**THE LAW OF COMMUNITY**

Your rewards and in life will be in direct proportion to the value of your service to others in your community / tribe.

The more you work, study and develop your ability to contribute more to the lives and well-being of others, the better life you will have in all areas.

There is no such thing as the lone wolf alpha male. 

To be alpha means you are a competitor, an expressor, and most importantly, a leader.

Lead your community - lead your social circle - lead your tribe.


**THE LAW OF RESPONSIBILITY**

You are where you are and what you are because of you.

You are fully responsible for everything you are, everything you have and everything you become.

**THE LAW OF PREPARATION**

Luck is when opportunity meets preparation. Perfect performance comes from painstaking preparation, often for weeks, months and years in advance.

The most successful people in every area invariably spend far more time in preparation than least successful.

The more ability you have and develop in any field, the more likely it is that lucky breaks will occur for you.

**THE LAW OF INTEGRITY**

Happiness and high performance come to you when you choose to live your life consistent with your highest values and your deepest convictions.
Always be true to yourself - you cannot be alpha by imitating others or trying to be somebody else. 

**THE LAW OF CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

Every business or position has a few key critical success factors that determine how well it does.

Identify the critical things you do that determine your success or failure.

Make a plan to get better at each one of them.

Master the Pareto principle - master the 80/20 rule.

**THE LAW OF PERSISTENCE**

Your ability to persist in the face of adversities, setbacks and disappointments is your measure of your belief in yourself.

He who succeeded 1000 times has failed 10000 times. He who failed once and quit has never succeeded.

Persistence is the iron rule of success; if you persist and practice and improve long enough you must eventually succeed.

**THE LAW OF INNOVATION**

One good idea is all you need to start a fortune. Business breakthroughs come from finding faster, cheaper, better, easier ways to perform a task.

**THE LAW OF REASONING**

You always give one of two reasons for doing anything-the reason that sounds good or the real reason.

The reason that sounds good is always uplifting and noble. 

The real reason is because your action is the fastest and easiest way to get the things you want, right now.

**THE LAW OF AFFIRMATION**

A significant percentage of your thinking and feeling is ‚Äúdetermined by the way you talk to yourself.‚Äù 

Your inner dialogue is accepted as commands by your unconscious mind. Talk to you self positively and constructively all the
time, even when you do not feel like it.

**THE LAW OF PRACTICE**

Practice is the price of mastery. Whatever you practice over and over again becomes a new habit of thought and performance.

Growth and fulfillment come from abandoning old practices unhelpful and embracing new constructive ones.

You become what you practice and you improve what you practice. 

**THE LAW OF GROWTH**

If you are not growning, you aren't stagnating -- you're regressing! |

If you are not getting better, you are getting worse.

Make continuous learning and growth a part of your daily routine.

**THE LAW OF ATTRACTION**

You continually attract into your life the people, ideas and circumstances that harmonize with your dominant thoughts, either positive or negative.

You attract what you are and people are a mirror reflection of you. Your woman/women is/are a reflection of who you are.

Weak men unable to lead their women have fat girlfriends.

You can be, have, and do more because you can change your dominant thoughts.

**THE LAW OF TALENTS**

You contain within yourself a unique combination of talents and abilities which, properly identified and applied, will enable you to achieve virtually anything you can set for yourself in relation to those innate talents and skills.

What parts of your work do you enjoy the most, and are you the best at? 

This is your best indicators of your true talents.

**THE LAW OF IDENTIFICATION**

Hypersensitivity, or taking things personally, is a major source of problems in relationships.

Only by not identifying -- by detaching and viewing your relationship with
some objectively, can you enjoy it fully and act effectively within it.

A soldier goes to war where he sees his buddy blown to pieces. In the moment he will say ""rest in piece, but better him than me."" Back at camp he will tell his comrades what he witnessed without identifying with the incident.

This is known as ironic detachment. 

**THE LAW OF SUBSTITUTION**

Your conscious mind can only hold one thought at a time, positive or negative. You can decide to be happy by substituting positive thoughts for negative ones.

Your mind is like a garden. Either weeds or flowers will grow.


**THE LAW OF FINALITY - PART I**

No negotiation is ever final. 

If you get new information, or you are unhappy with the agreed upon terms, reopen the negotiation.

**THE LAW OF FINALITY - PART II**

When a decision is made, a man must commit to that decision.

If your girl cheats on you, there are no ifs ands or buts.

Cut her off, ghost, and that's final.

**THE LAW OF MINIMUM EFFORT**

You always try to get the things you want with the very least effort possible.

All technological advances are ways of getting greater output with less input.

All human beings are therefore basically lazy, seeking the easiest way possible at all times.

Use this to your advantage.

Recognize this within yourself and use your will to exert more effort for goals you really want.

**THE LAW OF EXCELLENCE**

Success and happiness are only possible when you become absolutely excellent at doing something you enjoy.

‚ÄúThe quality of your life will be determined by your commitment to excellence more than by any other factor.‚Äù
- Vince Lombardi

**THE LAW OF ACCUMULATION**

Great achievement is an accumulation of hundreds, and even thousands, of small efforts that no one ever sees or appreciates.

There is no quick or easy way to become an alpha male.


**THE LAW OF ASSUMPTION**

Incorrect assumptions lie at the root of every failure. Have the courage to test your assumptions.

The willingness to accept the possibility that you could be wrong will open you to possibilities and lucky breaks you might otherwise miss.

**THE LAW OF SPECIALIZATION**

To succeed in business, you must specialize in a particular product or service for a particular customer, and then do what you do in an excellent fashion.

A primary reason for business failure is a loss of focus.

Apply this to your general life -- master an art form rather than being spread too thin.

""Become good at something, no make it 2 somethings"" - /u/VasiliyZaitzev

**THE LAW OF MAXIMIZATION**

You always try to get the very most in exchange for your time, money, effort or emotions. When given a choice between more or less for the same contribution, you will always choose more.

People are therefore basically greedy in everything they do. 

This is neither good nor bad in itself. 

It just is.",26,1

So The Tomster has, until recently been engaged to a tall, handsome (no homo), rich ‚Äì the engagement ring he got her cost $50K ‚Äì entrepreneur, who she now describes as her ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù, meaning that their relationship suffers from a conditions that the Romans called: *Deadicus Bedroomicus.*  

She broke off the engagement because she ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt ready‚Äù ‚Äì meaning she has raging hypergamy ‚Äì and has been doing a ‚Äúlot of thinking‚Äù over the past couple of weeks about the State of Men, because evidently every guy in the country b/w 20 and 60 is letting her *‚Äúan‚Äô her frens!‚Äù* down.  It couldn‚Äôt POSSIBLY be women, even in the smallest way, but hey, remember what I said about No Self-Awareness?  Moving on.

Now, before anyone thinks I am down on the Tomster, she has some positive points.  First, she‚Äôs a Hard 8.  She‚Äôs 5‚Äô6‚Äù and usually women under 5‚Äô9‚Äù are invisible to me, but she‚Äôs def a hottie‚Ä¶.so long as she keeps her mouth shut.  But she won‚Äôt.  Because she can‚Äôt.  And what can we divine from the miasmic rantings that escape her face?  In about a dozen years, when she‚Äôs 40, she will be a Full Blown Karen.  So much so that, at that point, the expression ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù will be replaced by the expression ‚ÄúTomi.‚Äù

Second, Tomi did the right thing, early on, which was, at about age 25, she started dating her fianc√©.  So she vetted him early enough so that, if they got married, she could have started popping out kids at 27, 28 or 29.  

But then her Hypergamy got her.  One of the reasons that the Tomster arrived at the Gates of Epiphany on the verge of 28 instead of 32 is she is a successful media personality.  She‚Äôs hot, she‚Äôs on TV, and she probably has some coin in her pocket.  That‚Äôs great ‚Äì if one is a man.  If one is a woman, then it‚Äôs problematic because of what I call the *‚ÄúTaylor Swift Problem.‚Äù*  What is the Taylor Swift Problem?  Taylor Swift is mega successful ‚Äì she will eventually be a billionaire unless she fucks things up ‚Äì she‚Äôs tall (5‚Äô11‚Äù), so only 7% of the population of men (6‚Äô2‚Äù and up) are eligible to date her and she‚Äôs also hot, in a ‚ÄúNazi Love Goddess‚Äù kind of way.  Because women date across and up dominance hierarchies (men date across and down), only rich, handsome men 6‚Äô2‚Äù and up are on her radar.  That‚Äôs why Tay-Tay is still single at 30 and likely will be at 40.  

But back to Tomi.  Tomi dumped her fianc√© ‚Äì I am guessing ‚Äì because he was a ‚Äònice guy‚Äô.  Probably her emotional tampon etc.  No game ‚Äì he was one of those guys who didn‚Äôt need it because he was tall, rich and hot.  And now that Tomi‚Äôs hypergamy hamster is rocking like that Clash at the Casbah, that‚Äôs a problem.  She‚Äôs not attracted to him, but there are few men who will meet her ‚Äústandards‚Äù, so that means that ‚Äì it‚Äôs all MEN‚Äôs FAULT! 

Now, Tomi thinks she wants the Marlboro Man but what she *reeeeeeeally* wants is to Build Better Betas.  How do I know?  Because now, she has STANDARDS.  Y‚Äôknow for the ‚ÄúHigh Quality‚Äù men that she *‚Äúan‚Äô her frens!‚Äù* DESERVE.

First, are you SINGLE?  Not talking to other women (who she derisively refers to as ‚ÄúThotiannas‚Äù).  So you can‚Äôt even TALK to other women, never mind that she - *‚Äúan‚Äô her frens!‚Äù* - all have phones and DMs FULL of guys waiting for her to be single so they can be that #1 Draft Pick.  Bitch, PLEASE!

Second, you gotta ‚Äúmake a plan.‚Äù  I‚Äôm on board with this one.  Even if it‚Äôs *‚ÄúIma be at the Regal Beagle on Thursday at 9pm.  Come tag along.‚Äù*  That will only last for a bit, but really, get of your ass and get out of the house.  That said, what killed dating?  BITCHES FLAKING.  Flakes Killed Dates.  Go argue with the Sisterhood.^TM

Third, the Tomster - *‚Äúan‚Äô her frens!‚Äù* - want us to ‚Äòvalue value‚Äô.  In other words, we are supposed to be all happy about her - *‚Äúan‚Äô her frens!‚Äù* - being talented, skilled, ‚Äúgo-getters‚Äù who ‚ÄúMake their own money!‚Äù, blah, blah, blah.  This is typical of Women on the Verge of Epiphany.  Suddenly, bitches have REQUIREMENTS.  Did she have these at 22 when she was at Peak Attractiveness?  Fuck, NO, back then she had all the time in the world and was happy to get Pounded Through The Mattress by Chadwicke Chaddington III.  But now, if you want what she gave away, free, at closing time to every Drug Dealer, Outlaw Bikers and Escaped Mental Patients, you gotta PAY (metaphorically) in terms of committing and submitting to her Frame.

Sorry, that‚Äôs a HELL^To^The^Fucking^NOOOOOO! from me. 

Why?  Because starting near the Epiphany Phase, the Power shifts to MEN, and in the World of Men^TM what MEN want MATTERS.  Men **Do.Not.Give.A.SHIT** about how much ‚Äúambition‚Äù a woman has.  Oh, we might SAY we do, and it might even raise their RMV.  But we don‚Äôt.  *‚ÄúThat law degree looks so sexy on you!‚Äù* - Said No Man, Ever.

Men look for two things: Youth &amp; Beauty.  Why?  Because they are indicators of fertility and the only thing we need women for are the production and care of children.  That‚Äôs it.  Maybe some cooking and light housework.  That‚Äôs it.   Everything else we can provide for ourselves.  If women vanished from the planet tomorrow, we‚Äôd have a shortage of nurses, teachers and secretaries.  If men vanished from the planet tomorrow, Civilization would last until the first oil change.  Actually shit would start going wrong in the first 15 minutes when power stations would start going offline (and the ‚Äòblack start‚Äô plants would not come online to take up the slack) but shit would REALLY be fucked within 30 days.

So men care about facial symmetry (which we call ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù), plus an approximately .72 Waist-to-Hips Ratio (a girl‚Äôs ‚Äúhourglass‚Äù) plus long hair, because the length and condition of a woman‚Äôs hair can tell you a lot about her health, and therefore her suitability for producing *los* babies.

Talented and skilled?  Sure: Talented in the bedroom and skilled at sandwich-making.  

Oh, and for all her complaining about how all men want to bang 22 year olds? ‚Äì which, in fairness, is true.  Was the Tomster pissing and moaning about this when SHE was 22 and getting MAX attention from men?  I bet you can Name That Tune in One Note. 

She has a couple of other points, one about ‚ÄúConsistency‚Äù which is basically *‚ÄúPut up with my shit, and give me what I want, all the time,‚Äù* and the last one is *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Äô be a bitch‚Äù*, which, conveniently, is ‚ÄúStep 1‚Äù in Uncle Vasya‚Äôs Three Step Program for Finding a Husband.  What she means is don‚Äôt come back to her after you‚Äôve flaked.  Whatever.  

What the Tomster needs to LURN is she is about to pass her biological advantage over to men.  She needs to LURN what that means.  Like I said, I have a Three Step Program for Finding a Husband:

Step 1: If you are a bitch, STOP.BEING.A.BITCH.  Men no likey.  When a 28 y.o. gets ATTITUDE with us, we look over at yon 22 y.o. and think, *‚ÄúHmm.  Yon 22 y.o. has delectable 22  y.o. hindquarters.  And she doesn‚Äôt seem interested in BITCHING about Every.Little.Thing.  She smiles a lot and is sexy, happy, believes everything we tell her and is never ‚Äòtoo tired‚Äô for fun.‚Äù*

Step 2:  Do everything you can, as a woman, to improve your looks.  Why?  Because, that‚Äôs what we care about.  Youth and Beauty.  Don‚Äôt like it?  Go argue with God.  Or Nature.  Or Aliens.  It‚Äôs what Daddy wants.

Step 3:  Lower your requirements.   Men have three requirements, generally: is she attractive to them, can they have a convo with her, and is she a warm person.  Women?  The list is 3847 items long.  *‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Steve, sure, you have a good job, always do your best, work hard, try to make me happy and would be a GREAT dad, but you used the wrong fork and dinner, so I have to disqualify you.‚Äù*

If a girl doesn‚Äôt want to do those three things then she doesn‚Äôt want a husband.  Simples.  

**The Takeaways**

-Avoid uppity bitches.  A girl says she is ‚ÄúSTRONG‚Äù and ‚ÄúINDEPENDENT‚Äù?  That means she‚Äôs LOUD and OPINIONATED.  Look for *feminine* women who are warm, caring and dedicated in making YOU happy.  

-Hypergamy is an 800 lb gorrilla.

-In the Long Run, Men Win.  After 30, we have all the advantages.  So be of good cheer.  Make yourself into something and you will be sampling from the pool of 20 and 30 year-olds, when you are in your 40s and 50s.",177,1
Against The Regime,"Yesterday I was eating some delicious cheese sticks during lunch break and I couldn't help but laugh at Chris Cuomo's sweaty face on the giant TV as he desperately tries to counter some Trump tweet in 1984 style. I couldn't help but notice how The Regime seems so powerful yet so fragile, like a huge castle made out of glass.

Today as the US economy collapses, the financial press says China is on the verge of collapse. As the west condemns China‚Äôs ‚Äúlack of democracy,‚Äù the Regime is attempting to thwart Trump at all costs including financing violence against supporters and censoring campaign messages. As the American press invents story after story without consequences, the Regime condemns China for having a ‚Äústate owned press.‚Äù As the Regime realizes it has no popular support or legitimacy, it condemns China for being ‚Äúauthoritarian.‚Äù

""How does this help me get laid?"" well if you're american your masculinity is constantly being attacked. Each day their is a new word or slogan being thrown at you, each day their is a new movie undermining men. 

Navigating the Regime's landmines is no easy task, so how does one counter the Regime without getting destroyed? Well you have to understand that The Big Gay Empire won't do your bidding unless they absolutely have no choice.

Stalin didn't become [pro family](https://indypendent.org/2017/10/the-soviet-unions-forgotten-feminist-revolution/) until he realized how disastrous these policies were for the state. Divorce rates were sky high, russian men were abandoning their families, mass alienation ensued, confusion reigned everywhere. Add some gulags to this recipe and you get a massive shortage of men willing to work for free.

No matter how much you try to vote for Republicucks or much you try to convince a feminist to have children it is near impossible to stop this train. The good news is that this isn't sustainable and the incoming collapse is a sign of things correcting itself. 

The economic collapse will force immigrants to go to Canada and they will need women to start making babies again. Additionally The Regime's defeat in Afghanistan will make them reconsider their position on masculinity. They know that an army of soyboys and transexuals will be no match for the powerful Chinese Dragon.

I for one welcome the collapse with open arms, in the meantime I'll probably go on welfare, buy some crypto and eat my tendies.",41,1

What I have learned from dating after 60,"Background:

At the age of 40, I married my only wife in 1993. She died of cancer in 2019 at the age of 62. We were married for 26 years and had two children that we sent to college. When she died I was 66 years old. The last time I dated there was barely an Internet and no such thing as On Line Dating (OLD). But I had a friend (who is dead now) tell me tales of Plenty of Fish and getting laid on the first date a LOT. That was 10 years ago. There have been some changes. Here is what I have learned in 9 months:

Some things I have learned about modern On Line Dating OLD

1.OLD feels like it is not working at all until it works

2. You still only need one woman

3. It has never been easier to get laid than right now

4. OLD can be maddening, make you laugh, has a lot of ups and downs

5. OLD takes a lot of time

6. Getting laid on the first date is a very real possibility

7. There are women out there that are hunting men and write the men first

Women that sleep with the men on the first date and write the men first are getting all the good men. Good men are very rare now.

**After 65 there are only 39 single men for every 100 single women (39%).** Men die sooner and some have died and men can remarry younger women very successfully and few of them are single after 60.

***‚Äúmen are much more likely to remarry than women,‚Äù With 2.55 women for every man among unmarried people over age 65, and 3.27 unmarried women for every unmarried man over 85, ‚Äúa man who wants to remarry has a very large pool.‚Äù***

**Only 15% of all men are over 6 ft tall.** Women insist on a man over 6 ft tall or at the very least, taller than they are by a few inches.

**70 percent of all men are overweight (fat).** So only 30% of the men over 6 ft tall are not fat. Let's recap: 39 men for every 100 women. 15% are over 6 ft tall. 30% of those are not fat. Let's do the math:

.39 x .15 x .30 = .01755 (calculated ratio of High Value Men to women over 65 yrs old.)

There you have it folks **there are only 1.8 (almost 2) single men over the age of 65 that are also over 6 ft tall and also not fat, FOR EVERY 100 SINGLE WOMEN**

**What does this mean? The internet teaches us that the odds of a woman marrying after 60 are 1 in 62!**

""*By the time a woman is 30, there is about one chance in two she will ever get married and at 40, only one chance in five.* ***By the time she is 50, the chances she will marry are just*** ***one in 16, and after 60, her chances drop to one in 62***

note for math junkies, 1 in 62 = .0161 about the same ratio as ""good"" men to women over the age of 65 (.01755)

This is all good news for men over 60 and bad news for women over 60. If women really want a man they have to take everything they ever learned about OLD and throw it in the trash. After 60 years of age, OLD is a fun game for men but a game that 61 women out of 62 women have to lose üò™",169,1

Alpha Gorilla Notes for Beta Faggots,"**Develop an IDGAF mentality.**

Stop giving a fuck what others think. You are an alpha male, they are beta males. All there is to it. 

Literally, stop fucking caring. You‚Äôre the alpha, you aren‚Äôt threatened or or living by any rules, you have no reason to give a fucking shit about anybody or everything. Live for yourself first. 

Do what the fuck you want. The alpha gets to do whatever the fuck he wants because he is the alpha. You are the alpha. Therefore do whatever the fuck you want. Let others live under your rules and your reality while you live under none. Let those cowards worry about rules while you don‚Äôt give a shit and do whatever the fuck you want. 

Amused mastery. This is your world. Focus on enjoying yourself. Life is meant to be enjoyed, that‚Äôs why dopamine fucking exists. Don‚Äôt be caught up in an alpha or cool act. That shit is for beta males who need validation. You should be having fucking fun.

Let go. You need to stop trying to be anything else other than who you are. You do not need to prove shit to anybody. Other people don‚Äôt have that power over you. Just live. 


**Hold frame.**

Your rules. Have your own values and beliefs. Do not follow the rules society has set for you. Have the balls to only participate in what you believe in. This is alpha. You don‚Äôt take the rules of others you follow your own fucking rules. It‚Äôs literally that simple, you‚Äôre living in your own fucking world and nobody else determines what the fuck you do. You own your shit and give 0 fucks what anybody else thinks. DGAF. 

Know yourself to be the authority figure. You‚Äôre the alpha in a sea of women and betas. You have the right to act however the fuck you want and do whatever the fuck you want. The moment you stop acting however the fuck you want is the moment you become a bitch ass beta faggot living by somebody else‚Äôs rules. 

It‚Äôs your way or the highway. If someone doesn‚Äôt get with your values and principles, then they don‚Äôt get to be a part of your life. 

Be immovable, unaffected, and non-reactive. Do not be reactive to the frame of others. Don‚Äôt even flinch. How the fuck would you be threatened by a soyboy beta faggot? This is your world. As a man, you control a situation by being non-reactive to it. 

Destroy shit tests. Do not be perturbed by others attempting to break your frame, or assert their frame over you. Give 0 fucks about their approval, do not try to prove anything to them because then you are entering their frame. Literally fart in their fucking face with your lack of shits given. 

Be selective about what you respond to. Ignore anything and everything you‚Äôd prefer someone didn‚Äôt say/do, and only respond to things worthy of a response from you. The alpha chooses what he responds to idiot betas with. If idiot betas say some idiot shit, they don‚Äôt get a response.

**Put others into your frame. Hold the power and reinforce your dominant status.**

Put less effort in. Put less effort in to others than they put into you. Let them do the work to please you. Don‚Äôt try to please them. Let them please you. 

Take your time. Let others wait for you, don‚Äôt rush yourself for them. If they get mad, too fucking bad for them. What the fuck are they gonna do?

Withhold your validation and attention. Let others qualify themselves to you and compete for your validation. 

Lead the way. Determine the conversation, determine the activity, determine the workout, whatever. Let others operate in your world.",2,1

Why should we avoid single moms?,"Disclosure: I have never dated a single mom and i do not have children.  I don't hate kids they are entertaining but i like my peace. Its probably because at around 8 my first of many nephews was born and my sister had to stay with us. I couldn't stand the crying the diapers and how it set her life back by decades.  

Now that i am older and have my life together it boils down to resources including time and money.  Im spontaneous when I want to do something its get dressed and out the door or if its a bigger deal it becomes a question of picking a date right then and there making reservations etc. If the girl has a kid then you have to play this waiting game that drives me insane. Your hands are tied. Waiting on someone else for my happiness is something I will never do again since my divorce. Also on the subject of time you have to share the girls attention with her kid.

As for resources, dating is expensive. After a couple of dates the kid is going to need a doggy bag or start coming along. Then after the date its straight home no spontaneity. And just taking care Of a kid financially just doesn't sit well with me.  It boils down to my happiness again. Why put myself through this if there are soo many single childless girls out there. 

One last thing why settle? If its a pump and dump then it doesnt matter but if you want sometype if relationship it does  We are mgtow but that doesn't make us monks. There are few things like showing up with a dime on your arm.   Im 46, lift weights, watch what i eat, and at the prime of my career.  When i do date they are attractive girls from 24 to 32.  As long as men stay on their purpose we do not have to settle. Get out of the mindset of this is the best i can do or all the girls my age have kids.",4,1

Social Exchange Theory: Implications &amp; Examples,"The Social Exchange Theory is crucial to social power.

And if you are interested in persuading people, getting what you want and being liked‚Ä¶¬†Then you must apply the social exchange theory.

**Social Exchange Theory Definition**

I will define social exchange theory as:

A unifying framework from sociology, psychology and economics with which to analyze and understand social dynamics.
It postulates that people seek out partners and relationships where the value exchanged is in balance.

**What The Social Exchange Mean To You**

Put simply, it says that social relations are based on exchanges of value.

The three major corollaries are that:

1. To get what you want, you have to give others what they want
2. The most popular and powerful people are those with the most to give
3. Strong and relationships have a balance of give and take¬†(or at least, the people in them must feel they are balanced)

**Social Currencies: What People Want**

There are countless currencies that people exchange in the interpersonal marketplace.

The most helpful and insightful way to understand the social exchange theory is to divide the currencies in terms of ‚Äúvisibility‚Äù, which we‚Äôll call ‚Äúlayers‚Äù.

**External Layers:**

The qualities people usually first notice in you:

* Looks
* Style
* Physical fitness
* Body language / Nonverbal cues
* Posture
* Grooming
* Walk¬†and swagger

**Mid Layer**

Not necessary to exchange information, but can be uncovered observing your environment:

* Money /¬†Resources
* People around you (the cooler your group the cooler you‚Äôll be perceived)
* Social Proof (people respect you)
* Upbeat, positive personality (make people around you smile)
* Position in society / venue (owner, professor at uni etc.)

**Deeper Layer**

To access the deeper layer people need to get to know you:

* Knowledge
* Connections
* Great personality
* Riveting conversations
* Life experiences
* Life achievements
* Mastery (of something)
* Future potential (to acquire any of the above)

**Being Vs Appearing: A Question Of Social Currencies**

When people discuss ‚Äúbeing‚Äù VS ‚Äúappearing‚Äù they are discussing the visibility of the social exchange currencies.

In some social situations external layers win the day.

Some people won‚Äôt need deeper qualities and the gloss of the external shell will immediately make you a high value giver for them.
This is why women need to fight the idea that they only achieved success because of their external qualities.
Locations such as noisy clubs also heighten the importance of external layers as it becomes harder to access them.

**External Layers are Pass Through for Deeper Ones**

Most people will not be very interested in accessing your deeper qualities if you don‚Äôt reach at least a minimum threshold of external qualities.

External qualities are then what will get your foot in the door.

Have great external qualities and more and more people will be interested in your deeper layers.

Example: how willing are you to talk with a smelly homeless in tattered clothes?
That homeless is the extreme example of someone with highly negative social external currency: just by being together, he takes social value from you (note: a few people can transcend that but we‚Äôre talking 0.1% here).

**Layer Mixup**

The usual ‚Äúappearing VS being‚Äù dichotomy is, of course, nonsense.

All layers always influence each other all the times.

Example:
Beautiful people are perceived as smarter, people in authority positions are perceived as taller (Bowden, 2013), and great personalities who make us feel good are perceived as more attractive.

**Marketability: What Currencies People Seek?**

Not all currencies have the same value.

A Mastercard with a million USD in the bank lets you buy anything anywhere.
A million cash also gives you good options.
The equivalent value in Ukrainian Hryvnia gets complicated: you need to find people who want that currency, or convert it (ie: find a way to present it well).
A million USD worth in, say, Palladium, is even more impractical: how are you even going to convert it?

Notice all currencies have the same nominal value, they all take the same effort to acquire, but they heavily differ on how readily they are accepted.

Social currencies are similar.
The external layers such as beauty and grooming tend to be appreciated by everyone.
Deeper layers are more situational and people specific.

Life experiences in travels for example, make your insight and stories hot currency for people who love travels and adventures or dream of something similar one day.

But people who are not interested in ever leaving their city? Not so much. There it can actually highlight how the two of you have little in common.

**Mid &amp; Deep Layers Marketability**

Mid layers don‚Äôt show to just about anyone, but they become suddenly visible when you interact with people.

Conversation skills and social skills, for example, are very attractive social currencies for everyone.

On the other end of the spectrum, if you invest most of your time developing a vast knowledge of, say, entomology and you become a research professor in that field that will not make you very interesting outside your classrooms -entomology is the study of insects-.

So you already see the first corollary of getting what you want with the social exchange theory:¬†develop currencies that most people want.

Mastery‚Äôs Broad Appeal: the Halo Effect

There is an exception, though.

If you spend all of your time developing values in areas nobody cares, you can still become attractive even outside your area of expertise.
Why?

Because peak performers have power.

You‚Äôre a developer?
Boring to most anyone. But if you‚Äôre a wiz of coding, popular hacker and pioneering a whole new language, now that changes the game.

It‚Äôs because high levels of achievements say great things about you.
For example, it says that you got grit and determination, that you can focus, and that you likely found your passion. In a world of undecided people who don‚Äôt know what they want that makes you stand out.

And of course, standing above the mediocre masses is often an attractive quality by itself.

Plus, of course, you‚Äôre very likely to become rich, successful and powerful.

**The Relativity Of Currency**

Currencies are very relative.

Nobody would exchange a million in cash for a hunting rifle these days. But if society were to collapse and we‚Äôd get thrown back to the stone age, then a million in cash is useless scrap paper and a hunting rifle becomes priceless.

Social currency is the same.

Any type of skill is a currency and how people will value is¬†highly dependent on the situation, the person and the specific need in the specific time.

So for example, if you‚Äôre¬†buying a house¬†and someone introduces you to a realtor who can share tips and knowledge, that realtor is hot currency. 

But after you bought a house and don‚Äôt have a cent left? That realtor better have something else going on for him.

Subjectivity also plays a role.

There are some standards of beauty and style, but there is also a level of subjectivity.

**Currency Values: A Situational Analysis**

There‚Äôs also a situational element in the value we possess.

A professor can be an idiot most people don‚Äôt wanna speak with, but when he steps in his classroom many students crave his approval.

Or you can be an idiot, but if you bring a date to a club where you skip the line, get served quicker and everyone says hi to you, you look like you have loads of social value and being with you in that environment.

**High Value People: Who are They &amp; What They Want**

High value people have, of course, have lots of value to give.

But guess what?

High value people prefer giving value other high value people.

Why?

Because they can get back more, of course!

The social exchange theory says that¬†people who have a lot to give also demand a lot back.
And if you‚Äôre a high-value person, it doesn‚Äôt make sense for you to enter into an exchange with someone who doesn‚Äôt have anything to give back.

The rule of social exchange is the reason why people tend to pair up with mates who are similar in socio-economical background, education and even level of beauty.

Also high value people often experience lower value people trying to piggyback on their success, their status or their beauty.
It gets tiresome and people with a lot to give tend to be wary and heavily guarded against people who seem to be just out to take.

**The Burden Of High Value: The Psychology**

Imagine this situation:

Sara is the head recruiter of a major corporation.

She‚Äôs smart, cute and takes care of herself.
She has lots of value, particularly among those looking for employment -or a mate-.

Sara has lots of people pleading for help and then sending poor CVs that only wasted her time
And of course, some of them are the usual ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and friends of friends who ask for a job and put her in the difficult situation of having to refuse them.

Some colleagues are also out swinging for her sexual value: it‚Äôs almost routine that at the company‚Äôs parties someone gets drunk and sloppily makes a pass at her.

She tries to fight it, but she is irritated for being a target to many simply because of her looks.

‚ÄúGod‚Äù, asks Sara, ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt these people see her for who she really is‚Äù?¬†&lt;‚Äî here Sara is complaining that people only see her external currencies, nobody being interested in her deeper layer

She particularly feels a pang of resentment when she sees the eyes of people brightening up when she mentions her job in recruitment.
She feels they only care about what she can do for them, without giving anything back¬†&lt;‚Äî Sara is complaining about the lack of reciprocity in the social exchange here

That‚Äôs how many high value people often feel in the presence of the many value takers.
The value takers are trying to get something from them without giving anything back.

In game¬†theory,¬†these people are also called ‚Äúfree-riders‚Äù.

In real life, they are called ‚Äúfreeloaders‚Äù.

This is crucial to understand, because this is what many low-value individuals fail to understand:¬†high-value people don‚Äôt want to mingle with low-value people who don‚Äôt make an effort to rebalance the relationship.

The second part is important: maybe you don‚Äôt have enough to give back, yet. That‚Äôs fine.
But then you should show that you are willing to make an effort. And with that effort, you are basically communicating that you‚Äôre aware of the imbalance and you are willing to make up for it.

**Value Takers: Who Are They?**

It‚Äôs been my experience that the most consistent ones to fall afoul of the rules of social exchange share the following traits:

* Social Climbers: they see people only for what they can do for them -the ones brightening up when Sara mentions her job-

* Nervous &amp; Insecure: states are contagious, nervous people make us feel nervous and we don‚Äôt appreciate that

* Egocentric: we all are the center of our own worlds and resent the ‚Äúme, me, me‚Äù people who claim that spot all for themselves

* Braggarts: we like people who make¬†us¬†feel important, not those out to prove¬†they¬†are important

* Chatterboxes:¬†we like to be heard, we don‚Äôt like to listen to nonstop blabber

* Teachers: people who ‚Äúteach‚Äù without first making sure we want to learn. It‚Äôs annoying because the teacher position assumes superiority (and hence our inferiority), and that‚Äôs a role that should be¬†given, not¬†taken.

* Socially Oblivious:¬†have no idea of how social dynamics work (one example below)

Socially low-value people don‚Äôt even realize they enter relationships by asking without giving.

I, as anyone with a business, has¬†plenty of examples of freeloaders, people attempting to take your time without giving anything back and not even realizing they‚Äôre being a nuisance.

* Shy, loners and socially awkward.

This deserves a special mention. While we could argue that some of the above are personality flaws, being overly shy or socially awkward is more about skills. Shy and socially awkward people can otherwise be amazing human beings.

But the lack of social skills still makes them a social liability.

I have met many great human beings whom I would have loved to bring with me somewhere.
But then I would think: he/she is going to stand all by himself and will only talk to me.
The socially awkward and overly shy indeed are often overly dependent on you to have a good time and make you feel like a babysitter.

It might sound harsh to say, but it doesn‚Äôt make it any less true: overly shy and socially awkward people are a bigger social liability than any of the above category: not only they will make you look bad for having uncool friends, but¬†they will be a drag on your time and freedom.

**Value Taking is Relative**

Most people tend to cluster around the middle and the average.

Such as, most people are not particularly rich in social value to give and neither are they major social value takers.

However, these people can still become value takers (or givers) when they go for people who are much better than they are or when they spend time with those who have much less value.

So here is the funny thing:

**Value Taking Can Help You Grow**

You have probably heard the self-help gurus saying that if you are the best person in a room, you‚Äôre in the wrong room, right?

Or more self-help gurus advising to spend time with people who are better and know more than you, right?

Basically: the self help gurus are advising people to be value takers.

But here is the important caveat:¬†to access people‚Äôs higher value and not be rejected as a social leecher, you need to find a way to rebalance the social exchange by giving something back.
And that‚Äôs what the socially obvliious don‚Äôt understand.

**Value Taking And First Impressions**

The most important instances of value taking happens at the beginning of a relationship.

When a relationship is still fresh, there‚Äôs no past history, no favors done and taken and no goodwill.
Also, the balance is exactly at 0.

And the social exchange theory tells us that when people are getting to know each other they are unconsciously weighing each other up in terms of possible utility.

Conversely, it‚Äôs often acceptable to ask and take when you have a solid relationship already in place because you‚Äôve most likely given already a lot and you will likely give more in the future, so there‚Äôs more leeway.

**Typical Expressions Of Value Takers**

Here are some examples of social exchange deal breakers:

‚ÄúLemme know when you‚Äôre having some cool party (so I can tag along)‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you doing something tonight (so I can tag along)‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I pick your brain over coffee sometimes (you give, I take)‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, please, please‚Ä¶¬†¬†‚Äú

You will recognize that all these messages are requests that don‚Äôt give anything back.

Sometimes just a little fix could make them more balanced.
For example the guy who wants to pick your brain could¬†invite¬†you to lunch.

Lunch is a small token, of course, but more than the monetary value it shows that the inviter¬†gets it¬†and shows respect and consideration for your time and knowledge.

**Takeaways: Give to Take**

The most important take away is this:

The more you bring, the more you can take.

The three major corollaries to away from the social exchange theory are:

1. Focus on what you bring to the table:¬†Make this your N.1 rule of social exchange
2. Ask yourself if the relationship is balanced: where the imbalances lie is where social power lies
3. Assess takers and givers:¬†Are the people around you taking or giving? Cut out the takers, give more to the givers.

If you understood thus far, then you can move to ‚Äúvalue and availability‚Äú, which explains another fundamental concept of social skills and emotional intelligence.

**Summary**

The social exchange theory is an important theoretical framework with some of the most fundamental ramifications to get good with people.

Why women lie about n-count,"A friend of mine came over to my place distraught. He and his wife were talking about the number of people he slept with. He of course had a normal number like eight. He was stunned when his wife, who is about six years younger than him, said she's slept with over sixty men. And that was probably less than the actual number as well, but I didn't tell him this as he was already looking very OJ Simpson like.

Most women you'll meet, I won't say all as their is the occasional woman with less of a body count (virgin women aren't real, stop waiting for them), have slept with a very high number of men. This goes counter to what we are told, even after the sexual revolution which allowed a number of women to achieve sluthood nirvana. Women don't want to be seen as sluts. Even though they are.

You shouldn't be bothered by her high n count, but this should tell you something about female nature.

1. Women like sex just as much as you do.

Women have poor impulse control, which is why most of them age so poorly. As such, with the ability to get dick constantly, they often partake in that vice. 

Now why do women lie about their n-count? It's the same reason she's skittish about sleeping with only after one hour of meeting you, even though she wants to. She doesn't want to be seen as a slut. This is advantageous to you. The key to getting women is comfort, if she feels safe and at ease around you, she's more willing to engage her impulses, which include jumping on your dick like a trampoline.

Is it bad that women are huge sluts? Probably, but you can't change anything about it. Even if you give her the best fucking of her life, once you leave she'll use one hundred cocks to try and get over you. I'm not slut shaming, I'm teaching you how to get sluts, which make up the majority of the population. Enjoy.",438,1

The carousel in the East versus the West,"The carousel is a universal phenomenon, simply because casual sex itself is.

Even though there is no culture in which casual sex is considered particularly edifying behaviour -- it is rather frowned upon -- the carousel still has an important r√¥le in society: It is widely used for sexual tension relief.

What is the difference between the carousel in the East versus the West?

In the West, the idea that a woman would expect a nominal fee in exchange of casual sex is frowned upon. The act of asking money for sex is considered immoral, while in the East, it is the casual sex itself, regardless of payment, that is considered questionable practice.

Therefore, in the eastern mentality, if a woman is going to whore around by engaging in casual sex, she could as well collect cash for it.

One important side effect is that in the East, the whole idea of game is considered dumb.

You can always compensate your lack of effort and even your poor looks by offering the girl cash instead of theater.

The longer I live in the East, the more I find the western idea of theater-for-sex to be utmost ridiculous. Seriously, I vastly prefer cash-for-sex. I consider it to be far below my dignity to act like a clown in order to talk a woman into my bed. Instead, I just flip a few green backs through my fingers and be done with it.

As far as I am concerned, someone who does ""game"", is just a ridiculous clown.",86,1

## Women as we know them

We all know how secretive and sly women can be.  We read and/or write our field reports about women who dumped their boyfriends, or worse didn‚Äôt dump them and still rode other cock.  There is little doubt that women CAN cheat and there is lots of evidence that they DO cheat.

What does cheating mean?  Well, it‚Äôs a grievous insult and injury.  We are red pill men.  We study women.  We learn how they behave and how to guide their behavior through our actions.  We are special.  Cheating is bad.  Yes.  But when they cheat on us it is way, way worse.  They know better because they were with US, not some beta scrub.  

## Pre-cheaters

Unfortunately I have bad news.  Women are even worse than that.  It isn‚Äôt just that they may seek other dick.  It‚Äôs that they already had other dicks.  **THEY ARE ALREADY CHEATERS.**  Before they got to you, they give their precious pink slippery crotch socks to other men so they could shoot their jizz in there.

How fucking disgusting is that?

Not only are they denying their duty to be our women but they are participating in a sacred, special biological act with other men.  And this is why promiscuous women are fundamentally broken, beyond redemption and uncategorically unsuitable for being our girlfriends.  A woman that have not had sex with other men have not pre-cheated.  They have not insulted you yet.  They have not injured you yet.  They respect you and your penis with its need to engage in a sacred, special biological act with them. 

Not convinced yet?  Well it gets even worse than that.  Do you like touching the semen of other men?  Do you like touching things touched by other penis?  If you do, that means you are gay.  Hey, nothing wrong with that, but why are you here?  Load up some phone app and you‚Äôll be awash in ejaculating penises in zero time.  So when you put your penis into a woman that has had sex with another man, you are functionally touching his semen and his penis.  You are gay.  

The key is to find women that have not pre-cheated and put all your effort into making them yours.  Your semen must be the first in them.  You make your mark on them like a dog on a tree.  Who is the higher order species?  The tree or the dog?  The dog of course.

BE THE DOG!

## Ok, so now you are top (heterosexual) dog.  Maybe.

Let‚Äôs summarize in a concise bullet list of important things to remember:

1. Women can and do cheat.
2. That hurts our feelings because we are special and they need to respect that.
3. Promiscuous women (defined as having had sex before) have already cheated on you.
4. Therefore they don‚Äôt respect you.  How they feel about you is very, very important.
5. Additionally, they have performed a disgusting biological act that only be reserved for very special people and moments.
6. Your red pill imperative is to find a woman that isn‚Äôt broken and make her your exclusive biological act partner‚Äîforever.
7. Only in this way will you not be gay.

But this is where it gets tricky.  How do you REALLY know a woman isn‚Äôt a pre-cheater?   It‚Äôs not like their pussies turn bright blue when their hymen is broken or their belly button pops out like that thingie on a thanksgiving turkey when she takes her first load of dick goo.  As long as they minimize the dripping (as we all know women are non-stop slime leakers), you won‚Äôt be able to detect previous semen without an electron microscope.  And can you afford one of those things?  Probably not and how the hell are you going to get it up her ass?

You can‚Äôt play this game the male way‚Äî-objective criteria, worldly evidence and logical thinking.  Nope. You have to do it the female way‚Äî-underhandedness.

## Vetting a non- pre-cheater candidate for your presence and carnal favors.


No woman will tell you the truth about this stuff (or really anything else).  Their words are worthless, so the vetting process is entirely up to you.  The following is a simple to understand program for vetting; it entirely realizes on your commitment to vetting and not the subject female in question.


**A) The interview**

What?  Max, I thought the words of women were not trustworthy? Correct, they aren‚Äôt, but you‚Äôd be amazed how many women admit to being the skank sluts they all are.  So just ASK them about their sexual history.  They may confuse you for someone that is interested in their pleasant, warm physical presence and excellent ability to relieve your testicles, and actually tell you about their ass spreading escapades.  Dumb bitch.  She just got disqualified.


**B) Secret agent penis-man**

You need to snoop.  Snoop a lot.  Most women are insufferable attention whores so this won‚Äôt be too hard.  Scour social media.  Again, her words are tricky because she is a woman: you need to look for the underlying meaning in everything she says. You‚Äôre a guy.  You can turn anything sexual.  So take her words and see if you can turn them into something sexual.  If you can, then clearly she‚Äôs hiding that she is a slut.

EXAMPLES:

Unicorn candidate says: ‚ÄúI had a wonderful time with the gals last night.‚Äù

Unicorn candidate means: ‚ÄúI had a wonderful time with the gals last night.  I got three numbers to choose from for the guy that‚Äôs going to three hole me tomorrow night.‚Äù

Unicorn candidate says: ‚ÄúI made a salad for dinner and pet my cat before bed.  Such a stress reliever.‚Äù

Unicorn candidate means: ‚ÄúI did a cam show of jamming a cucumber up my twat until I had a screaming orgasm.  I‚Äôll sleep like a baby now.‚Äù

This is where all those years of jerking off to porn will pay off.  Channel all that experience into translating the words of women.

Also try to contact her friends and gently pump them for information.  Find out where she lives and works.  Do you see a lot of guys coming and going?  What about her parents?  Does her mother look like a post-wall carousel train-wreck?  The slut doesn‚Äôt fall far from the whore tree.  Signs are everywhere.  Read them.


**C) The examination**

Ultimately, this is not enough.  You will need to personally check.  Here is a checklist of specific things you need to verify.  ANY is a disqualifying feature.  You should use gloves because if she is a pre-cheater, the examination may make you gay.

- Everyone knows sex makes the vagina loose.  Check for tightness.  It should allow only a single finger before causing her discomfort.
- Look for excess wrinkles around her mouth due to cock sucking.
- Check her drawers for slut items: Dildos, other objects that could be used as a penis, anything she could shove up her ass, personal lubricants, panties that aren‚Äôt white, anything that vibrates, anything that could hide vaginal odor and/or anything a male might use or wear (cock rings, socks, etc).
- Empty all of her garbage cans and check for slut items:  condoms, condom wrappers, tissues with any sort of gooey stuff on it (semen), personal lubricant dispensers, used pregnancy tests and/or examination gloves.
- Check closets for male clothing.

When checking their garbage, be aware there is some controversy around tampons.  Some suggest that only sluts (women that have had sex) would use them.  A few counter that convenience would make any woman attempt to shove cotton up their snatch.  Go with your gut on this.  However if they flush their tampons, that‚Äôs disqualifying, since clearly they are trying to hide evidence of other fluids up there.


**D) The decision**

No vetting is perfect.  Women are crafty and there is just too many things to check.  Go with your gut on this and not your dick.  Sure, you want to fuck someone, anyone, anything, but you can‚Äôt listen to your dick when making this decision.  Since you can and will only have sex with the best possible candidate, go with your brain and whatever nagging sense tells you it is a good idea or bad idea.  Alternately it is useful to make a list of pros and cons that you can pass by your friends so you can build a consensus.

## Ownership and maintenance of your non- pre-cheater

Eventually you may select a non- pre-cheater to be yours.  Before we get into practical methods of obsessing over their fidelity, let‚Äôs review a nightmare scenario and work back from there.

**How do you know she‚Äôs actually texting her mother and not her side lover using elaborate code words that make getting three-holed in the back seat of a trans-am parked behind a dive bar sound like laundry tips for removing stains?**

You don‚Äôt.  Women are super, super good at communicating and creating elaborate ruses is easy for them.  Capability is as good as action‚Äî-no effort needed.  Because of both hypergamy and their abilities, you have to assume they are on the cusp of cheating at any moment.  All they need is to take that last step.

Capability.  Ease of action.  Engagement.

These are the three elements of success, therefore you also have to assume they will succeed.  And certain success makes the willingness to do something much, much stronger.  And this is the greatest AWALT of all.  Your sweetie is not a unicorn.  She is not special and true.  She is like all other women and you cannot count on her not to cheat.  Her willingness to cheat is there and strong.

##So it is up to you.

You have three tools available to keep your non- pre-cheater chaste and available only for your cock.  

**1- The Watchtower Move**

KEY ACTION: You are the sentinel of her vagina.  

You cannot leave it to its own safety.  Only you know what is best for it (you, of course, being an RP alpha).  So it is up to you to keep it close to your watchful eye at all times.  Here is another bullet list of important tips for how to do this.

- Have her move in with you and put nanny cams everywhere.
- Insist on doing everything together.
- Buy her a cat (but not a dog!).
- Give her fattening foods to make her less desirable to other men.
- Carefully chart her vaginal excretion patterns so you can detect any excess seepage.  At the same time sniff and lick her panty crust looking for changes outside her norm.

**2- OPSEC**

Women expect you to guard their vaginas.  Yes, after years of bullshit feminism in the modern media, many will initially reject you being with them all the time and fingering their pussies to check their fluid levels.  This is the sort of bullshit SJWs have put upon us.  But remember-‚ÄîYOU ARE THE PRIZE.  You are the red pill alpha.  Keep frame and they will quickly realize it is in their best interest to go along with your program.

So are you safe now?  Absolutely not.  This might keep her from getting railed over a bar table during ladies night out whither friends cheer them on, but this will not account for more deceptive practices.  Keep in mind my previous example.  Let‚Äôs say she is home (your place) sick and tells you her mother is dropping off some get better soup and cough medicine.  How do you know this isn‚Äôt Chad delivering feel-better cock and throat soothing jizz?  You don‚Äôt.  

KEY ACTION: Monitor and analyze.

Monitor is to make sure you can watch all of her communication.  Check her phone frequently.  Listen in when she is talking to other people.  Install key loggers on all her devices.  You will need to be sneaky.  Watch over her shoulder to get her passcodes.  Sneak up behind her or through doors to listen in on her.  Perform due diligence on the best key logging and monitoring solutions and deploy them properly (check the laws first!  You can‚Äôt monitor her from a jail cell.  There are lots of other alpha men out there doing this, so tune in on their forums and you will get all the information you need.

Women can neither shut up nor stop plotting to get dick, so this monitoring will create a large amount of data.  You will need to go through all this data for evidence of cheating.  This takes us back to the vetting stage‚Äîagain try to take any communication and situation and see if you can sexualize it.  If you can, then you have a clear problem.

**3- The Red Pill Man**

KEY ACTION:  Be the Alpha that she should be under.

As we have learned, women want to be red pill alphas. So even after you land your special non- pre-cheater, you need to continue showing your alpha traits.  You can‚Äôt just let up and hope your presence and watchfulness will keep her in check.

Here is a refresher of what it means to be an Alpha with your sweet lady:

- If at any time she says something you don‚Äôt like, storm off in a huff and show her who is boss.  
- Deny sex as a means to assert dominance.  Carefully calibrate the number of times you allow her access to your penis.  If it is too much, she will think you desire her.  If it is too little, she will find another penis to fill the void.  She won‚Äôt be able to resist.
- If she shit tests you, call her a cunt.
- Playfully tease her by pointing out all her stretch marks, noting imaginary ones if there aren‚Äôt any.
- Never eat foods that she likes.  In fact, insist on meals that she does not like.  You cannot let her think her preferences have any influence on yours.
- Get into a fist fight with any guy that bumps into her accidentally or otherwise.  An alpha protects his territory from predators.

Keep your non- pre-cheater fed and maintained and she will provide you years of just the right amount of alpha red pill enjoyment.  

## So what was this about your girlfriend?

Did I stutter?  She is a raging slut.  For some of us, this post is too late.  I found out she fucked other men.  I have a very strong suspicion she is fucking other men now.  As an alpha red pill man, it‚Äôs pretty clear she cannot be my girlfriend.

This is what it means to be an alpha red pill man.  You make your own destiny.  You come here to get the information.  You act on the information.  And when the time comes, you make the tough decisions‚Äîparticularly with a slut.  

## Conclusion

This is everything you need to know about getting sex.

I have learned a lot in my life and I want to share.,"**I** have lurked here for a while and a lot of times I see some great points in this subreddit and sometimes the men here are completely misinformed. I will give my background and history with women. 

**F**irst, I have no qualms with giving my name. My name is Brandon Gallemore. You guys can look me up or reach out if you are feeling the need.

**I** was born in 1989 at the very end of the year. I grew up pretty poor, initially in [Fort Worth, TX.](https://imgur.com/NQwgsz0)

**I** had an older half-brother who lived with his Mom down in the Houston area. [I also grew up with an older sister and a younger brother,](https://imgur.com/eDSBjZV) each of us separated by about roughly a year and a half. I was smack dab in the middle as a kid. By the time I was [five](https://imgur.com/vDqJXws) we moved out to a place called Weatherford, TX on the [outskirts](https://imgur.com/vDqJXws) of town. Not sure who cheated on who, because I never got a clear answer before my Dad passed away, but one of my parents cheated on the other during a big period of drug use/alcohol abuse in both of their lives. Everything fell apart and my Mom met my step-father, Steve. 

**H**e was a single guy who lived in a [place](https://imgur.com/AjfS0md) that his Mom had owned prior. Steve is a musician and smoked a lot of weed and did other illicit drugs while we were kids. He never had children of his own and so instead of talking to us, he chose to spank us EVERY SINGLE TIME we did something wrong. This is where I think I became somewhat of a bitch, or a beta as many here like to say.

**T**he neighborhood we were in was right on the boundary of poverty and lower-middle class. We had beat up trailer houses and an old apartment building a few houses down from our house. My Mom's family lived in a place like [this](https://imgur.com/jfkGxuS) while we lived paycheck to paycheck and maintaining a fairly poor diet (another beta move). As a kid [I was always up to something.](https://imgur.com/syeXtSB) I was skinnier than most of my friends, and goofy. I had to be funny and intelligent to make up for a lack of my own perceived weakness (more on that later).

**O**n top of growing up in a poor neighborhood we also dealt with my Dad being in and out of prison. My main influence on who taught me to be a man was my Mom. In my opinion, that shouldn't ever have to happen. The community around my family failed us. Maybe because we were white, we were perceived as being ok, but we weren't at that time. More apathy from those around me made me angrier. I became more beta as a result. I white-knighted for girls in school and got into fights for them multiple times. It was usually the same few girls dating shitty dudes and then the guys would hit them, so I would feel the need to hit the dude. My Mom encouraged this behavior too. My Mom said to ALWAYS hold the door, PAY for the date, NEVER hit a woman under any circumstances (which I still don't do, but disagree with the premise). 

**T**hese lessons that I learned along the way didn't help me. They taught me to be weaker. I consistently bowed down to the women in my life and with modern-day entitlement it was a recipe for disaster. I turned to drugs and alcohol around 15, [which was roughly the time this photo was taken.](https://imgur.com/4n0tBDJ) I had already had multiple sexual experiences by this point, the first being with my sister's older friend who climbed on top of me even though I had told her I didn't want to when I was 13. Women were consistently crossing my boundaries and even playing games with my emotions at times. I accepted all of it though.

**E**ventually I met my [""true love""](https://imgur.com/z58saDo) my junior year. I was a walking boner my junior year and accepted whatever woman threw herself at me. She was the first one to stick. She told me stories initially of how her first sexual encounter she was rape (which she later admitted to me was a lie). I didn't share my story with her, because mine felt so trivial in comparison to how violent she said he had been. This girl never held a job, never had to work a day in her life, even chores. I had a job from the time I was 12 with my Uncle and as soon as I could work legally I got multiple jobs and held them throughout my high school career. I should have seen that disaster coming from a mile away, but at 17 years old you are bound to fuck things up and boy did I do that.

**I** was walking through the halls of my high school one day after getting stoned at lunch. My buddy Jarvis turned to me and said, ""Look over there, they're doing testing for the military. Let's go take the ASVAB."" So, instead of going to class, I skipped it like I always did and took a test, that test changed my life.

**A** few months later we got the test back and Jarvis scored higher than me. He received a 92 and I had gotten an 83. I was so competitive that it made me feel even worse. I felt like I would always be less than others. That poisonous mindset carried into my relationship as well. I joined the Air Force as an Air Traffic Controller (highest suicide/divorce rate) and within two years we were separating on account of her cheating. She had been cheating on me for about a year and was coming home late at night and sleeping with me after she slept with the other dudes, yes dudes (she had two separate affairs).

**A**s you can imagine I felt ultra cucked and wanted to kill myself. Instead, I got into another relationship, and another, and another. Each kept failing and I got more and more miserable. I was still skinny and decided to start working out. [These pictures](https://imgur.com/Xbjl8dN) were supposed to [showing progression,](https://imgur.com/RhE1k32) but I neglected my fitness still for years, despite being in the military. I would do the bare minimum that was required at our PT.

**A**t the end of 2012 I met someone who I knew I loved. She was sweet and kind and didn't have any expectations of me. She supported my hobbies, which included music and writing. I thought I sucked, but she liked it. Of course, with my life being my life [I got orders to Korea](https://imgur.com/cDHlgIh) within a few months of meeting her. I felt like a black cloud was over my head. Her family had their doubts and I had mine and due to insecurities I cheated on someone that I loved after only being in Korea for four months. I told her immediately, because the guilt ate me up, but she let it ride for another six months before we finally split. My entire first year in Korea felt like a waste and I was the reason. [I was ready for a nuke to be dropped by this point.](https://imgur.com/dQKHM6S)

To fill my sadness I turned to sleeping with women, a lot of women. When I had gotten to Korea I had probably slept with 15 people in my life. By the time I met my [next ex-wife](https://imgur.com/shdxVlN) I had slept with upwards of 40 people. Plating or whatever bullshit this sub wants to call it won't fulfill you, just going to go ahead and say that now.

**W**e got [married!](https://imgur.com/5N3zh1F) She was this gorgeous woman that barely spoke my language. I was ok with it, because she was pregnant. She wanted an abortion and I didn't so I got my what I asked for. She was a Bridezilla too. The wedding cost us 20,000 dollars and she was a complete nightmare to me the day before and of. I was still being the good husband that would just accept it.

Right around the time I became a Dad I made Staff Sergeant in the Air Force. I remember a conversation some of the younger guys had with me when I was driving them to their dormitory in Korea. They told me essentially that they were glad that I hadn't changed and that they respected me as a leader. Most guys in the military let power get to their heads, but I had literally never even had power over anything so my first instinct wasn't to abuse it. I just cared about the people, and maybe that is why I am writing this post too.

**T**hen my first son, [Cason](https://imgur.com/YiT1vvJ), was born. My wife at the time told me that she didn't love me and she was drinking often while also angry at me for not being more involved. I would come home stressed the fuck out from working foreign pilots as an Air Traffic Controller. By the time I got home, it would always be hand the baby to me. I felt used and abused. She didn't have a job, she rarely cleaned and her version of cooking was to let rice sit in the rice cooker and crack in egg in a pan and serve it to me. It was tough, but I gritted my teeth and kept on as I had most of my life.

**W**e found out we were expecting another boy, [Jacob](https://imgur.com/u9Eog8a). She didn't want to keep him initially either and that was a whole other debate to get her to keep our child, she relented and then sat in resentment for the next few years.

**I**t was finally time for us to leave Korea. I got orders out of there after three and a half years and we were going back to Sheppard AFB in Texas. I was excited to finally get back to American soil, my kid's Mom was not. As soon as she got here the entitlement started. She would complain about the fact that we have to drive everywhere and that there were no cities. She would nag about my family not being more involved and coming to visit. Those are obviously all important, but I was being held hostage because of this negativity.

**W**ithin a month of getting to Texas [my Dad](https://imgur.com/7a10rQa) passed away from liver failure. He had been drinking heavily for years and his body finally gave out. I had only gotten to see him one time in four years and he was dying by the next time I saw him. I sat in the hospital with him for five days. My entire family came the first day, then no one came again until he was dead. My ex would text me and tell me how bad of a father I was to my kids because I wouldn't come home at the time. I wanted to be with my Dad. When it was finally his time to go I sat and watched all of it, completely alone. It was something that changed my life and I will never forget. My Dad was taking guppy breaths and had stubs for legs, because of an amputation that was necessary due to sepsis and gangrene and he was alone. The only person in the world who was their for him was me, that's around the time when it all clicked. 

**I** sat in his apartment for 30 days and did every drug in his house. I showered two times during that period and barely remember anything. My ex showed up, obviously upset and reasonably so. I was in a really bad place though, she hadn't been there for me when I needed her, but when she needed me she was screaming and showing no respect to me as a human. I needed someone to reach out to in my life, but no one was there for me. My brother, my sister, my Mom, wife, everyone was wrapped up in their own problems. 

**A**t the end of that 30 days I returned to normal life. The military had given me time off to grieve and I had barely done any. I covered my emotions up with more abuse to myself. I started seeing parallels in my life and my father's. We got pregnant with a third child. I bet you can guess what she said. She drank heavily and smoked cigarettes telling me almost every night that she would kill it that way if the insurance wasn't going to help pay for it. She did that for about three months and then decided she wanted to keep the baby and went to the OBGYN.

**O**n that day her entitlement shown through the most. She had succeeded and our baby was dead right in front of both of us on the screen. She began sobbing and screaming at me in front of the nurse and then we got out of there. Within a month her Mom and brother showed up in Korea to support her and simultaneously ruin our marriage. While they were there her brother told me that I needed to do more, even though I was working ten hour days and coming home to take care of children. We almost got into a fight over it. She left the country shortly after, the first time.

**I** did more drinking and pot smoking when they left and got separated from the military with an honorable discharge. They diagnosed me with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. I can't imagine where the anxiety comes from. She came back for a while and I talked myself into believing things would be different. Within a few more months [she had hit me quite a bit](https://imgur.com/Imk6k2Y) and I finally caught her on video doing it. I took it a lawyer and went to take her to court, by the time I got back home she was already on a plane to Korea. That was in November 2018 and the last time I have seen my kids. It felt like I had lost everything back then.

**I** tell you all of this, because I want you to know who I am. I should be the woman hater. I should have every reason to want to disregard them as people and ""plate"" them as people here like to say, but instead of continuing to get angry, I looked inward. I moved to Denton, TX, a creative city and started over. As I had said, I had always loved music. I told people when I first got separated that I wanted to do all of these really big things. I wanted to write an album and a book and a series. My step-father told me I had delusions of grandeur and needed mental help. I took it as a challenge, again I am competitive and I had gotten it back with nothing to lose. I wasn't scared of pissing people off anymore, what were they going to do, take my kids away? The worst thing had already happened to me. I started [working out](https://imgur.com/ucErlfY) and working on me.

**B**y the end of 2019 I had written a few songs and played for a group of people for the first time in my life. I had been dabbling with the guitar for 16 years and finally just decided to [DO IT!](https://imgur.com/C40B4xu)

**N**ow, as of last week we have a [full 13 song album.](https://imgur.com/tvX64I8)

**I** also set up a [News/Documentary](https://imgur.com/imGriKD) production company as well as a separate TV series/movie production company. We have a cast of 20 people on a series and a full ten episodes written. We start our filming on Aug 16. When I first got to this town people legit scoffed at me and made fun of me behind my back about all of my ""ideas"". I seemed crazy to everyone, but I just stuck to my own gameplan. I am about halfway finished with a book as well, but I have been stuck for a little while. This is my 30th year of life and it is my best, so far. I am in peak physical condition and have a goal.

**T**he real Red Pill is not focusing on other people. Others will eventually always let you down, but you can rely on yourself, whether that be for securing a ""plate"" or for actually improving humanity and imprinting your goodness on others. I grew up poor enough to not have had a chance. My older half-brother didn't really get one. He was in prison two times by the age of 22 and dead by the end of that year. I saw those things in my life, most people don't get that perspective, so I am trying to give it to you now. Go check my history on reddit if you want, this isn't a throwaway, I have nothing to be scared of.

**W**omen are equally important in society and if you have a believe counter to that, then that is likely why you are single. Don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean everything about us is equal. Men are superior athletes, while women can carry children, those types of differences do exist, no matter what an SJW might say.

**D**on't give up, don't lose your stamina. You'll find your luck is only the residue of the work you put into something. Don't stop talking if someone tells you to stop, but also try and be respectful. No one will ever respect an angry child. If someone disrespects you then make sure they don't make the same mistake twice. You have immovable boundaries, things that aren't compromising. You can have soft lines in the sand on some things, but be ready to die on your shield for an important cause. Don't give up your hopes and dreams, guys.

P.S. 

**I** [am back with the woman](https://imgur.com/H2OA3Uw) I met before getting to Korea. She and I were friends for an entire year and she was going through a separation. I was actually in a relationship also and we were friends initially, but in the last six months we have gotten [serious.](https://imgur.com/O2xr4xT).",232,1

A Simple Trick To Get Rid Of Bad Habits,"""As it turns out, while human beings want to both avoid pain and gain pleasure, they will do more for one than the other. Avoiding immediate pain is much more motivating than gaining immediate pleasure. Studies have demonstrated time and time again that people will do much more to avoid short term pain than they will to gain short term pleasure.""

You want to break a bad habit? Use the following formula:

**Pain of doing the bad habit &gt; Pleasure Gained = No bad habit**

You want to keep doing a bad habit? Use this one:

**Make your brain only think about the pleasure &amp; forget about the back end pain = Keeping the bad habit.**

You know the consequences of a bad habit, but yet you're unable to stop doing it. You might think it's a willpower or discipline problem, but usually it's a memory problem (can also be an environment one, but that's for another post).

You need to keep reminding yourself of the back end pain that comes with a bad habit.

How?

Measure the TRUE cost of your bad habits by writing them down. Once it's written down (on somewhere easily accessible like a notes app on your phone), every time you feel the ""urge"", remind yourself of the pain by reading it. You want to make it as emotional and painful as possible.

Here's an example a friend wrote down:

\[TRUE COST\] - Spending too much time on Reddit

=&gt; Way less motivation for the rest of the day

=&gt; Less motivation = not doing high ROI tasks that will improve my life

=&gt; Not doing these tasks will produce less business growth

=&gt; Less business growth = less results for my clients

=&gt; Less results for my clients = unhappy clients + firing

=&gt; No clients = no income

=&gt; No income = having to work a shitty job

=&gt; Having to work a shitty job = depression

=&gt; Depression = shitty life = suicide

He visualizes the pain that will come with this bad habit every single day, which allows him to stay VERY disciplined.

Now, this might be a bit extreme, but this dude (very successful) is where he is in life because of how extreme he is. He uses pain in order to motivate himself to do what has to be done. 

\[Also, a side note, if you actually want big success (ie. money + lifestyle wise), being extreme is the only thing that will get you there. You have to do what 99% of people are not willing to do. You have to do the dirty and grueling work.\]

So measure the true costs of your action and use pain to your advantage. Who knows? This simple trick might change your life.",19,1
A Feminist Proposal,"Summary: A social commentary on why all men must support feminism, a subversion of gender roles taken to its satirical extreme.

\-----

Body:

Let‚Äôs start by defining feminism. It is the advocacy of women‚Äôs rights on the basis of equality of the sexes, where anything a man can do, a woman can do too. Men must let them.

When schools integrate sports into co-sex leagues or when the Boy Scouts of America simply becomes the Scouts, let them. Let your daughters compete with your sons. In order for your daughter to become the man, she must become a boy. The first lesson for any boy is that the world doesn‚Äôt reward complacency. A man must earn his success through competition.

Your daughter is now growing into a strong young woman with a can-do attitude. She understands her value in her accomplishments, soccer state champs, little league state runner ups, etc. Unlucky for your daughter, she wasn‚Äôt born the prettiest. Sarah is prettier than her. In high school, Sarah was the homecoming Queen three times, and in college, Sarah has started talking to older men like her professors. You remind your daughter that she is the man, and that no man is entitled to his suitors attention. So, your daughter puts on the war paint and skimpy outfits, Clinique, MAC, Chanel, and attracts her man.

If boys can play with girls, girls can play with boys, and so she does. She joins that sorority, Alpha Alpha Alpha, where all the pretty girls go, and messes around with only the best looking suitors like all the men do. But, it‚Äôs so annoying that these smart but average looking guys keep approaching her. Stay in their lane. If they were men, much like her, they would have worked harder to be attractive. She does crunches on Tuesday, runs 2 miles on Wednesday, eats half Chipotle burrito on Thursday, puts make up on Friday, Saturday, Sunday nights, but these men just play video games and reuse their crusty jeans. Don‚Äôt even bother to buy her a drink. If they were real men, they‚Äôd work for her attention because she‚Äôs earned it as the man. The nerve of them!

Now, your daughter has become a woman. Sorry! I mean a man. Despite all the accolades and degrees, it bothers her that at 28 she is single and alone. She set aside her younger years to get the party out of her system and taking steps to build a successful career, but what bothers her the most is that she‚Äôs not getting the same attention than when she was younger. You must remind her that she is the man, and that men are judged as objects of success. Remembering her fierce competitiveness from her youth coed swim competitions, she doubles down and faces the competition of the workplace.

She‚Äôs in the proving grounds. If women like her desire for an attractive, ambitious, successful man, then she must also become ambitious and successful. It‚Äôs already given that she is attractive -- she bought that Chanel palette. She battles on and loses some promotions, some fights, but comes out on top as a middle level manager that knows how to navigate a world of men. She has finally become a competitive man. She knows her worth, how to get what she wants. Willful. Fully committed to embracing the strong independent woman that bows to no man, yet her life is unfulfilling.

The woman now is a couple years from 40 and unmarried, bemoans her singleness. Like a sage, you the rational male advise a fellow man to start dating younger. She does, and she finds her SJW 28 year old femboy-toy. He‚Äôs not the assertive toxic masculine guy that feminism denounces, no. Her husband is a compliant Niceguy who follows her every whim because she wears the pants in the house. If her women‚Äôs empowerment sorority or  the corporate world has taught her anything, it‚Äôs not how to be a wife, but how to be a go-getter husband.

The first couple of years the compliant husband was sexy, but now her husband seems so needy like the children they‚Äôve had together, making her feel like her husband‚Äôs mom. He makes the same amount of money, contributes to the same amount of bills, he splits the dates, he does more than his fair share of chores, he even stays at home to look after the kids, but it doesn‚Äôt make him any more attractive. It actually makes him feel more like a roommate. She reconnects with her long lost ex from her party years, and he suggests opening it up, spicing the marriage. Her husband says OK.

She hasn‚Äôt had sex like this in a while, and it‚Äôs enjoyable but her husband, who she was a beta provider, is sleeping around with young 20 something floozies and that makes her mad yet she won‚Äôt admit that this makes her insecure. How can a strong feminist woman be jealous of a man let alone her husband? Aren‚Äôt they equal? Deciding alone that this open relationship needs to end, she confronts her husband. He says no. Too bad! She didn‚Äôt ask for a prenup, nor a postnup prior to this entanglement, and why should she? How could she have had the foresight to see her husband's rising hypergamous nature if this man was a beta. The divorce will cost her and shared custody. She loses half, bemoaning where have all the good men gone. 

At the end of it all, she takes a look at the mirror. She doesn‚Äôt see a woman aged, but a man worn by life. She doesn‚Äôt understand where feminism has led her astray. You must remind her that the world owes her nothing nor sympathy for simply being a man. But, you are a better man. Give her a copy of the Rational Male, so he can finally understand what it means to be ***the man.***

\----

Conclusion:

* A feminist woman wants equality. Treat her as a man.
* As a feminist man, you are not obligated to be attracted to a feminist woman for she is a fellow man and shall be treated with the same respect as such.
* If you are a masculine male, you will be attracted to feminine women. Feminism can not change that nor is a feminist woman entitled to having a masculine man.",15,1

"The Sex War is fought between women, over men","
&gt;Pussy rules the world 

\- Madonna

The 'sex cartel' theory is that unattractive women control sex through a 'cartel' imposed on other women, which forces men into marriage or LTRs

The sexual laws and attitudes in society are created by women, and act in most women's advantage.

Traditionally women exchange sex for resources, creating a market for sex, however this is not a free market; women, especially older and less attractive women control the market through ""slut shaming"", laws against prostitution, and in some societies sex outside marriage, in order to create a ""coochie cartel"" that pressures men into marriage or LTRs.

Marriage itself was rigged against men, because men's only access to sex was through marriage.

This explains why women ""slut shame"", ""incel shame"", and are generally against pornography, prostitution, and casual sex.

It also explains feminist's obsession with prostitution and pornography, as well as the double standards over male rape victims, female promiscuity, etc.

**The war of the sexes is a battle between younger women who want a free market in sex, and older or less attractive women who want a cartel. Men are not an adversary in the battle of the sexes, men are the battleground.**

### The evidence for the sex cartel 

* Women prefer higher\-income men, while women's income makes little difference to men

* Women slut\-shame other women, and are aggressive against women who are competing for the same man 

\(sources: [http://web.archive.org/web/20141126055040/http://www.uottawa.ca/media/media\-release\-2477.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20141126055040/http://www.uottawa.ca/media/media\-release\-2477.html) and Vaillancourt, T. \(2013\).

### Some examples of women controlling female sexuality:

* Female circumcision: 

This is done by older women to younger women, to reduce their value to men. An anthropologist says:

&gt;But when you talk to people on the ground, you also hear people talking about the idea that it [female circumcision] is women‚Äôs business. As in, it‚Äôs for women to decide this. If we look at the data across Africa, the support for the practice is stronger among women than among men.

\(source:[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/04/female\-genital\-mutilation\-cutting\-anthropologist/389640/](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/04/female\-genital\-mutilation\-cutting\-anthropologist/389640/)  \)

A large scale review says:

&gt;Who supports and perpetuates these practices of female genital surgery? The available evidence points strongly and consistently toward women. The decision about whether and when a particular girl will receive the operation is made by her mother or grandmother \(Hicks, 1996; Lightfoot\-Klein, 1989\). The female peer group regards the operation as a mark of positive status, and girls who have not yet had it are sometimes mocked, teased, and derogated by their female peers \(Lightfoot\-Klein, 1989\). The operation itself is nearly always performed by a woman such as a midwife. ‚ÄúMen are completely excluded,‚Äù according to one work on the topic \(Boddy, 1989, p. 84\).

Men prefer sex with uncircumcised women \(source:	Lightfoot\-Klein, H. \(1989\). Prisoners of ritual: An odyssey into female genital circumcision in Africa. New York: Haworth Press.\)

* Prostitution:

This is direct competition to LTRs. Women treat prostitutes as 'scabs' to the sexual trade union.	

Women are more likely to think prostitution should be illegal than men	\(source:[YouGov \(2006\). The Spectator \- Sexual Attitudes.](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/today\_uk\_import/YG\-Archives\-lif\-Spectator\-SexualAttitudes\-060203.pdf) \)

The suffragette movement was a campaign to criminalize prostitution, that used getting the vote for women as a means to that end. As their slogan said: ""Votes for Women and Chastity for Men""

There are lots of quotes showing that here: [Votes for Women, Chastity for Men](https://greenpill.net/sex\-war#Votes\_for\_Women,\_Cha)

* Feminism

Feminism is just the political wing of the sex cartel: feminists have tried to raise the age of consent to 21, to ban women from wearing sexy clothing and to ban pornography.

Married women and women with wealthy husbands are more likely to be feminists, which supports the idea the sex cartel props up marriage.  \(source:  YouGov \(2010\). YouGov Feminism/ Suffragettes Results 180205.

* Islamic clothing

In Islamic countries more women are in favor of wearing traditional clothing like the hijab or niqab than men, and it is enforced by older women

### TLDR

##### Just to summarize the argument, traditionally: ##### 

* Women choose men based at least partly on his income

* Women compete for men

* Women individually pressure other women not to compete with them \(slut shaming\)

* \(mostly\) women collectively pressure other women not to compete with them \(laws against prostitution, pornography, sex outside marriage\)

* The more power men have in the sexual marketplace, the more permissive the society, and the more power women have, the more conservative

* In traditional societies men can only have sex within marriage, so marriage itself can disadvantage men and men will still get married

* Older women's interests are directly opposed to men. Men want a more permissive society, women more conservative. 

* Younger and more attractive women are men's allies

**If men want more power, we should campaign for more sexual freedom for women.**

"There is no ""The One"". Or: how oneitis can be traced back to the relationship between a man and his mother","**Summary**

""Oneitis"" and ""true love"" are merely a manifestation of underdeveloped or lost sexual male energy, often caused by a lack of transformation during adolescence. Every man needs to acknowledge that no woman will ever give him the love his own mother once did and start to develop his true identity and real mission. ¬†

&amp;#x200B;

**Intro - how are men affected?**

Ownership and expression of sexual energy and power, both in relationship with himself as well as with women, is a challenge for many men.

From the very moment they start sucking on their mother's breasts, men absorb the idea that they are special in the eyes of their own mother - their own Virgin Mary - and they experience the enjoyment of a unique kind of closeness. It is when men do not become fully separated from their mothers during adolescence, when the foundation is laid for a future problem often referred to as 'Oneitis'. ¬†Every other post seeking relationship-advice nowadays is something along the line of:

&amp;#x200B;

* ""But our relationship was something special""
* ""I cannot be happy without her""
* ""She was my soulmate, we had a spiritual bond""
* ""I \[M,22\] love my fianc√© \[F,20\] but whenever we fight she takes a dump in the living room. What am I doing wrong? Help please, our wedding is in 3 days""

&amp;#x200B;

Which all illustrate the indoctrination men have been raised to believe. But also illustrates an underlying trauma: how¬† men can keep searching for the motherly love they once experienced with their own Virgin Mary, only to find out they are looking for an ideal of womanhood that does not exist in the real world. And as long as men are not willing to acknowledge this, they are keeping themselves and their sexual energy hostage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Body - divorcing mom**

The history of civilization is full of examples of cultures giving boys the initiatory experience of graduating into manhood through a time of physical trials, which helps them symbolically cross a psychological bridge from the relative comforts of the longing to remain a mother‚Äôs son, into the rigors of adulthood. In this positive context, surrounded by male elders, some kind of physical/emotional wound occurs, helping the boy contact his inner strength, confidence and sense of responsibility.

In the modern world, most boys experience wounding but without a positive transformation. There are few official rites, few wise elders and a dearth of male role models outside the toxic status quo. As a boy grows up, he is being socialized about what it means to be a man by his father, by other men, and by society. The culture enforced by the media, education system and traditional religion reinforces that function. It involves boys learning to shut down emotions and to dominate others.

Without those initiatory experiences and transformation, adult men may sustain the longing to possess a woman purely for him just like he once experienced with his own Virgin Mary. These infantile needs have been sentimentalized and romanticized as ‚Äúlove‚Äù. We often refer to it as ""onitis"". But it is merely a manifestation of the underdeveloped or lost sexual energy, resulting in seeking approval from women (or rage towards women, as soon as he finds out the ""love"" is not reciprocal).

It takes courage to face and process the anger and acknowledge the massive cost of disconnection from a man's true self. A man can find his ‚Äúlost source,‚Äù but will never do so in the form of physical women. It may take years to address these issues. It has taken me many years and I had to marry and experience infidelity first before I had the courage to seek a therapist. That was when I found out that I wasn't Owning My Shit, but was desperately searching for women who would acknowledge my self-worth just like my own mother did 35 years earlier.

Divorcing mom means letting go of all the toxic programming and setting appropriate boundaries, developing an integrated sense of self, stating your own needs, ensuring they are met and last but not least, have compassion and empathy towards your inner child. And that's where you heal ""oneitis"" and reclaim your sexual energy and power.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lessons learned:**  

&amp;#x200B;

* Find community with other men who are on this path of recovery of their sexual energy and power of who have already done a significant amount of work on this journey themselves (hi TRP!).

&amp;#x200B;

* Learn to differentiate between the pain of the past from what‚Äôs happening in the present.

&amp;#x200B;

Being the Archetypal Alpha Male,"The dual-mating strategy we see today is a result of hypersocialization and the birth of societies, specifically around when currencies/money became essential.

When we were living in caves and bashing rocks together, men who were fit were both physically capable and had resources, since resources were directly related to your ability to acquire them and defend them.

*The alpha male was a protector AND provider.*

As we became hypersocialized, and society evolved with things like ""money"" to represent resources, it became possible for physically unfit men to acquire and protect resources through non-physical means. It also became possible for strong men to have shit for resources, because resources were no longer directly tied to their physical fitness as a male. Social ability is a migratory byproduct, an indicator of fitness. Social ability is an *indicator* of physical capability or resources, sometimes both. It is never the sole determinant, as the female dating instinct does not care about social power, just whether or not that social power translates into physical ability and resources.

Truth of the matter is that now that male fitness is divided, the female dating instinct is hopelessly confused.

Men who are physically fit are almost always guaranteed a lay from a woman, as being physically capable *should* translate into resources per the old-world instinct. Except it doesn't anymore. Eventually, they need to get what their instincts failed to divine for them, Men with resources.

The opposite path yields the same results. Men who have resources are able to get laid fairly easily, and *should* be fit to have children wit. Though, as time proves again and again and again, women are quick to realize that these men are merely sock puppets. Their instincts found resources, but not the raw physical ability that those resources should unequivocally correlate. They start looking for a stronger more capable man.

Their instinct is no longer a completely suitable guide.

Ideally, the man they seek to identify is the old-world alpha, a unification of the new-world division, the masculine man made manifest in these confusing times. The physically capable alpha that can protect them and provide for everything they and their children need- as long as she remains subservient and he remains what she desires, a physically capable provider.

If you are both, there isn't a woman on Earth that wouldn't bow to your wishes in the hope that you will select her and gift her with your children. That is what it means to be alpha. To be the protector and provider of her entire world. Because that's what we were when we were bashing rocks together and living in caves.

"They Have Neither Interest, Nor Input","....in the type and manner of the relationship they want. 


Let's be clear - female ""flirting"" is to show up somewhere and look pretty, while hoping some mystery guy will do something about it.


Why is that?


They have absolutely no capability or desire to dictate the type of relationship you have. They certainly can't decide, even if they have some vague idea. That's SOLELY on you, as the man. So many fundamental TRP concepts are actually based on this simple idea.


Branch swinging happens because she will never make that move until some other dude has setup the terms of the new relationship for her.


Briffault's law is based on the fact her memories of your past are irrelevant, *because she would have to be deciding the terms and their meaning if they mattered*.


Hookups swipe left, quoth at least 12 girls I've piped on the first date. 


You really think a bitch that can't decide what to eat can proactively get the man they want? Hell no.


YOU have to decide what kind of relationship you're going to have, and be convincing about it. Strictly sex on Tuesday? Cool. Total monogamous devotion with babies in the future? Sure.


**BUT YOU DON'T ""FIND"" THAT GIRL. YOU CREATE HER.**


The whole point of spinning plates isn't that getting girls is important. It's a necessary step on the way to (i) figuring out what YOU want and (ii) learning how to dictate those terms effectively and efficiently.


Any time a woman is controlling the terms of the relationship, it's out of desperation or disrespect. That is total disaster in the making. You all know some ""yes dear"" faggot. Neither of those people are happy.


The moment you let (or worse, force) a woman start deciding what kind of relationship you have, the faster whatever it is goes to shit. This applies just as much on an approach as in a 10yr LTR.


I'll close by saying that **any time you are ""working on the relationship"" you have officially FUCKED UP**, because she is now making or remaking the terms. She didn't want to do that.",152,1

Four general areas to develop power,"TL;DR: I see four general areas (which overlap) to develop power/wealth in. These are: production, communication, logistics and protection.

First, let's start with a definition of power. Stealing the definition of power from physics (which borrowed from the natural language), power is the amount of work done in a certain amount of time. In blunt layman's terms: a lot of power means doing a lot of work in a short time. A person with a lot of power can get a lot of shit done quickly.

I think I'm preaching to the choir here, but just in case, POWER IS GOOD. Power just means being able to get good things done for yourself and your friends and family. (Some power can also be used to injure others ... but that's not the best use of it in my opinion.) Those men who are disgusted by power are disgusted by the power of \*others\*, not their own. It is simply envy ... though they may be disgusted by the particular use of power as well ... but if disgusted by power in general, it's envy.

Women, in general, are attracted to power and signals/signs of power ... though different women to different signals to different degrees under different circumstances/contexts. Even the Alpha Fucks/Beta Bucks just represents two kinds of power a woman is attracted to.

All that said, one should become as powerful as one can (without intentionally harming others) --- this will provide help to provide the best life for you and those close to you. Since power is just the ability to get shit done quickly, there are many manifestations of power, particularly in the modern world.

The two most obvious manifestations of power are probably physical strength and wealth ... and both of these fall into multiple of the general areas listed above.

Let's go over what I mean by each of the areas above.

Production has to do with the production of products and services for use or sale to others (can be either consumers' or producers' goods). This could be the making of shoes, making software, building houses (ability for manual labor being correlated with physical strength), giving orgasms or making music.

Communication is precisely that, communication. Sometimes that is advertising a product or service, sometimes it's advertising yourself (don't say you're ""better,"" by the way, say what makes you different). It's telling a story, telling a joke, giving a speech, drawing, painting, writing a poem, making music, writing a love scene, arguing effectively, talking down someone, giving encouragement, etc.

Logistics simply means moving things. This can mean moving yourself (being well traveled), it can mean being able to pick up heavy things (physical strength), it can mean being able to drive, bike, swim, load a truck, plan a trip, plan a move, plan a date, etc.

Finally, protection simply means being able to protect yourself, your woman, family, friends and things. Again, physical strength can play a big part here, but also various skills and knowledge. This could mean fighting skills, weapon skills, being able to fireman carry a loved one, first aid knowledge, being prepared for emergencies, knowing how to avoid taxes, etc.

You might notice that I don't mention knowledge as a general area to develop power in ... knowledge on it's own can't really \*do\* anything ... as far as I can see, knowledge has to be applied in each of these areas.

Perhaps this could be expanded a bit or even simplified. Certainly all models are wrong, but some are useful. Maybe this is a useful model to understand what areas you might be weak in.

Notice that I'm a big believer in the division of labor, so I'm not suggesting that everyone should be an expert in all of these things. But I think that men should have the basics of each area and then focus on one particular thing (likely in production, but perhaps some other area) to become and expert in and win his bread.",26,1
Developing Abundance Without Having Abundance,"[All Credit Goes to AMS (Alpha Male Strategies) for this post.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO1dZ3DLAXE)

I know many of us including myself struggle with developing abundance when there is none. It's easy to fake having abundance until you actually have it, but until you get to that point you can only fake it for so long until it starts to become a delusion. Don't forget that women can see this, because women are, by nature, experts on reading people and can tell if you're truly a High Value Male or just faking it, and if you're faking it, it will eventually leak out and you'll be outed as a Low Value Male LARPING. 

So instead of chasing women around all day and looking to get a fresh set of plates to spin in hopes of abundance, make yourself a High Value Male. Make your life abundant. How do you do this? You need to have a life that is fun and/or engaging by itself, with or without women. If you're sitting around all day waiting for Sally to respond to your text message then you don't have a life of abundance. You should be living your life and making time for **them** because of all the work, hobbies and life you're living. Not the other way around. 

If you have a life that you enjoy by yourself then it won't matter if you get ignored, rejected or even spit at. It won't bother you that Sarah flaked tonight because your life is great without her. You'll just go back to living your dope ass life and it's on her for not wanting to be a part of it. This mentality is also coined as ""I am the prize."" 

The 30 Day Guide On Achieving Abundance:

\- Don't worry about women for 30 days. Stop looking for choosing signals. Stop looking to approach. Don't worry about them. If a women happens to come into your life in these 30 days so be it, but don't worry about it. This doesn't mean don't talk to them. Do what you normally would do but don't fret on getting the number, creating attraction, etc. 

\- In those same 30 days. Build a life that makes you happy. Do the shit you've always wanted to do. Go skiing, read a book, learn a skill, watch your favorite movie, whatever, and once this life is developed, you won't give a shit if Rachel doesn't text you back because you have abundance in life. And most importantly **continue to live this life**. Don't stop after 30 days. This is more or less of a guide on getting started. 

After achieving abundance, you will have gained the right mentality of abundance and should use this mentality to guide you in not just efforts with women, but in life. 

Let me know what you guys think of this.

The girl that‚Äôs bought Chris a red rose,"   First of all,‚Äù Who the fuck is Chris?‚Äù, you may ask yourself. It‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm Chris. ‚ÄúWhy are you talking about yourself in third person? Are you retarded?‚Äù Probably. Leaving all these enigmas aside, let‚Äôs begin.

&amp;#x200B;

   Once upon a time, there was this guy who had once done all he could for a relationship in order to make it work, just to be eventually cheated on like the dumb fuck he was. It was bad. Like ‚ÄúGoing by train 250km at the age of 16 just to meet his girlfriend‚Äù bad. If you thought it couldn‚Äôt get worse, it does. One time he visited her, she decided to break up with him, and our poor lad‚Äôs knees went weak and he started crying in her arms. Now, we can‚Äôt really blame a 16 yo kid who was doing what he was told, which is ‚ÄúAlways try to make your woman happy‚Äù.His reality was shattered. But it doesn‚Äôt stop here.They soon got back together, because she suddenly gained interest in him after him ignoring her excuses and bullshit. Fast forward about half an year later and lots of struggles from our boy Chris, he went to a party with his ltr in her hometown, just for her to get tipsy and start kissing with another guy, thinking he was not in the same room. But he was. The image of betrayal still holds strong in his mind to this day. He packed his shit and got on the first train back home, promising himself never again to be in a relationship where he had to invest in a relationship more than the other person was. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a fucking pitty party man, what the fuck are you trying to achieve with your stupid sob stories?‚Äù Hang tight and be patient. Just to clear things out, she never visited me during a whole year of being together. Not even once.

&amp;#x200B;

   About two years later and lots of dates and women met, he finally started getting his confidence back. He realized that even though he wasn‚Äôt the best looking lad, he was a funny and creative guy with a really bold mindset. Had some successes, took some losses, but in the end he didn‚Äôt give a fuck about rejections any longer because he knew how it felt to be at your worst, so why not use this ‚Äúinvulnerability‚Äù and go for whatever he wanted, women related to say the least. He got to the point where he felt entitled to be treated well by his potential partners. The same way women feel special and want men to do shit for them,but he was asking for it. Some of his dates considered him retarded, some called him a jerk, prick, selfish bastard or spoiled, but some of them were so bewildered by his way of seeing things that just stood there in awe. ‚ÄúHow the fuck does this prick have the balls to ask me to buy him a fucking rose on the first date, one asked herself?‚ÄùChris didn‚Äôt give a fuck. He didn‚Äôt put any pressure on him getting laid, as much as he wished to experience as many things as possible. So during the first date with this nice petite girl, about a 7.5 nothing fancy, he brought up the fact that none of his previous girls he‚Äôs been with has ever bought him flowers. ‚ÄúShow up with a red rose next time we hang out or I‚Äôm not seeing you again.‚Äù They‚Äôd been together only for about 30 minutes, yet he was already assuming there will be another date, but only if she was to bring something to the table. ‚ÄúYou must be kidding me, are you a girl undercover or something? Only girls wish for anything like that‚Äù she jokingly replied. ‚ÄúYeah, forgot to ask you for a spare electric strap-on for tonight, mine broke last time. Shit was wild‚Äù Fast forward three days later, there was this 19 year old kid in a restaurant full of people receiving a red rose from a girl that some would have said was ‚Äúout of his league‚Äù or some shit. He didn‚Äôt fuck her until the 3rd date, but couldn‚Äôt care less. His experiment was successful. 

&amp;#x200B;

   Cool story bro, but what am I supposed to get out of this rollercoaster of good and bad stories? 

&amp;#x200B;

   Well, to begin with, never stay in a place where you are not appreciated just because of fear, because it usually only gets worse. Be it a relationship or your group of friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

   Second of all, sometimes in life you actually get what you wish for, so you better have the balls to ask for as much as possible, you‚Äôll be surprised. Same things apply to your love-life. But never go into the interaction needing something, only wishing for it, not giving a fuck if it happens or not because you are already having fun. Why would anyone meet strangers if they weren‚Äôt even having fun? It‚Äôs just dumb and shows how little you care about your time and the desperation to have sex with random people. Some of you may disagree, but having nothing else better to do is dumb to me. Some will disagree, but everybody is different so there‚Äôs that.

&amp;#x200B;

   Third of all, realize that even if you were to be doing things ‚ÄúBy the handbook‚Äù, there still are chances for you to fuck up. But then you will blame yourself for fucking up. So try setting aside the ‚Äúwhat if she‚Äôll leave me‚Äù and go for the ‚ÄúThis shit sounds fun, I‚Äômma do it‚Äù. I took a girl to a damn casino at 3am when I was 18 and fucked her afterwards. ‚ÄúWhy the fuck are we going to a casino? It‚Äôs fucking weird‚Äù. ‚Äú I want to. If you don‚Äôt wanna join, I‚Äôll drop you home.‚Äù Now, who the fuck would ask rather go solo in a casino at night than go for the close with his date? One mad man I tell you.But that mad man is for sure having options. Just seeing the face of the bodyguards at the entrance when an 18 yo kid got in at 3am with a girl that had previously done modelling was enough for me to have the best laugh I‚Äôve had in a couple days. That was enough for me. If I were to get laid didn‚Äôt matter anymore, because I still had fun. That‚Äôs why I was there in the first place. But I‚Äôll leave this story for another field report.

&amp;#x200B;

   Last of all, my favorite conqueror in history is Alexander the Great. Yes, you read that right. ‚ÄúBut what does the fucking king of Macedonia have to do with me fucking girls?‚Äù Don‚Äôt rush. It‚Äôs coming. This lad had been told by his mother that he was the Gods‚Äô chosen one since he was 3. He eventually ended up never losing a battle until he got into India, and that‚Äôs a really fucking long way to conquer from Greece. My point is, as Alexander had his mother, be that person for your own self. Cherish yourself, praise yourself, and always expect the best out of yourself. Have the boldness only one who was convinced to be favored by the Gods would have. Because in the end, one of the most masculine traits is courage, and brave men, even if they lose, are still honored.",10,1

You Get What You Subconsciously Believe,"It‚Äôs surprising to me how many people have an extremely negative outlook on life, and then have no idea why life isn‚Äôt very nice to them in return.

For instance, if you think all women are gold diggers, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll get. I see a tonne of comments from guys complaining, ‚ÄúWomen only want your money.‚Äù If that‚Äôs your outlook, you‚Äôre going to [confirmation bias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) and only look for women who confirm your negative outlook, whilst ignoring all the exceptions who *don‚Äôt* want your money. **You‚Äôll literally only see gold diggers everywhere you look.**

Women do this too. We‚Äôve all met a woman/feminist who says, *‚ÄúAll men are assholes!‚Äù* or *‚ÄúMen only want one thing!*‚Äù Again, confirmation bias means she‚Äôs going to filter out all the dudes who want a relationship/something ongoing, **leaving her with only the guys who just want sex.**

She‚Äôs creating her own reality.

If you believe people are fundamentally good, and being alive is a wonderful gift ‚Äì you‚Äôll project that into the world. People who have the same positive life philosophy will naturally be attracted to you and want to hang around you, which will make you even happier, which will attract even more happy people to you. It‚Äôs a self-reinforcing cycle.

If you believe women are likeable and decent and will generally bring fun, feminine energy into your life, then that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll end up with ‚Äì decent chicks who bring joy into your life. You won‚Äôt accept anything less; **you‚Äôll quickly get rid of any sub-par girls**, leaving only the ones that line up with what you want.

"Red Pill Can Turn You Into Thinking You Can Be An Island But Unfortunately, No Man Is An Island.","***No man is an island. - John Donne.***

Knowing about The Red Pill, game and masculinity is a double-edged sword. On one hand, you improve yourself but on the other, you can easily slip away from society. You'll start to purposely not want to be apart of society because it does not fit your views, which I guess is fine, depending on your aspirations.

But, if you ever want to really make a dent in this world, you'll have to learn how to be apart of it, 

This is why ""pick up"" advice is always ""go cold approach, walk up to a girl who you find interesting and talk to her."" good advice, but it's also a band-aid solution to a larger problem. 

Have you ever looked at the guys really into pick-up, have you ever noticed how they are only really ""cool"" within the realms of pick-up. They're outsiders, outcasts and can certainly be losers out of a pick-up context. What kind of high value man wanders around the street looking for girls to talk to? 

**A guy with no options.** 

Now, I'm not going to completely dismiss game and pick-up, because there's certainly good things to learn from doing it. I'm more so using it as a way to illustrate my point, the types of guys that do pick-up on a serious level are usually (not always) the type of guys who have nothing else going for them, which is why they need to actually go out and meet girls in such a blunt way.

If said guy stopped going out and approaching girls (and let's assume he's not using any online game) his supply of women runs out. That is NOT the quality of a high-value man, at least in my opinion. They think they are being the cool outcast, the cool sigma when in reality they are not cool, they're losers.

Outcasts are over-romanticized, the ""sigma"" archetype is so rare and even the sigma male has a large group of friends and is actively participating in society, whether he likes to admit it or not. He may not have a set ""group"" but he certainly has friends, albeit maybe less quantity wise compared to the extrovert. 

And this is the major problem with being Red Pill, if you're not aware of it, you'll become that outcast, you'll become the guy who thinks he's better than everyone else, that guy with an annoying chip on his shoulder. You'll seek people who are on your ""level"" and dismiss anyone that isn't. The only problem is that very few people are actually Red Pill, it's so rare and it's even rarer to find a Red Pill dude who's actually cool and not just cool within The Red Pill community. You'll become cynical to anyone that doesn't have the same views as you. (Notice how Red Pill guys tend to stick together)

I know this because I was and still am that person, I don't necessarily ""fit"" into any parts of society and my views, have blocked me from a lot of friendships with decent people. I'm an artist, which means I'm automatically going to meet a lot of people that are the complete opposite in views from The Red Pill. I'm too weird to get along with the conservative people and I'm too Red Pill to get along with the artist people but the catch is that I want to be a famous artist, I want to be a great artist. I want to be a millionaire through art, but how can I expect to do this if I dismiss the community that I need? Are Red Pill views even THAT important? Is masculinity overrated, are the views on masculinity STILL wrong? Does Red Pill even get much right outside of female and male sexual dynamics? 

I'd wager that the answer is no. Red Pill should have just stayed with female-male sexual dynamics, because it gets almost everything else completely wrong, DEPENDING on what you want in your life.

Here's what I mean, there's one guy I know, he's got pink hair and I'd consider him masculine, at least in the definition of that he fights for what he believes in, isn't afraid of risk, etc. But he doesn't really fit in with what a ""strong male"" is within the context of Red Pill even though he is strong. 

Another guy I'd consider masculine is Lil Peep (look him up), even though he doesn't portray a conventional masculinity, how can you argue that expressing yourself fully, being 110% true to your own self and remaining authentic is not-masculine?

What's the difference between guys like Peep and someone like Elvis? They're both masculine as fuck it is just portrayed differently.

And if I were to meet a guy like Peep, I probably wouldn't want to talk to him (if I knew nothing about him before) because of my mainly Red Pill based views but now that I actually know a lot about him, I find him an interesting person and would certainly kick it with him. Again, Red Pill theory would say that someone like Peep is weak, a beta, pathetic, etc and I fully disagree with that.

With Red Pill you're kinda chasing an ideal, an ideal that doesn't really exist. You want the perfect, feminine women. Which doesn't exist. You want the girl who has no Instagram, no tattoos, wears dresses and is super feminine but you live in a place like Canada, or the USA where those things just don't get seen and that very same feminine, super sweet girl can be at the club with her friends wearing just a bralette and pants.

You want Red Pill masculine friends, that aren't afraid of a cigar, that reject 90% of society and know how to talk to girls, love Trump etc.

These ideals just DON'T exist and you're rarely going to meet people who fit these archetypes. You'll find the cool masculine dude, who sucks with girls. Or the girl who is super sweet but wears trashy clothing. 

**The world is NUANCED as fuck.** 

In my case, I may want a gallery showing but the curator is a feminist, she's extremely powerful in the art world but I decide not to work with her because she's a feminist. BUT how many art galleries are going to be ""Red Pill (to a degree)"" and also powerful connection wise? Probably none.

Something has to give.

If you want to get **ANYWHERE** in the world, you **NEED** other people. You need the weirdos, the betas, the feminists, the successful guys, the gay guys, etc, you might need any one of these people at some point in your life. 

Like I said, people are nuanced.

The feminist might have a huge heart.

The flaming gay guy might be a really good friend.

The weirdo might be your biggest fan and be the reason you get where you are.

The beta might be the gate-keeper to your success in your industry. 

The gamer might be a super funny dude.

You need **EVERYONE** and ***EVERYONE*** has something to offer.

And this, is the **HALLMARK** of a **ALPHA** male. The hallmark of the type of guy that girls cannot resist, the non-judgmental dude who can chat with anyone, who can make friends anywhere, the guy who can kick it with Jamaican dudes and blaze. The guy who can hangout with the business type guys. The guy who can go from flirting with the farmers daughter, to hanging out with some wild artists in the city. **THIS** is what we should be striving for as men.

Your views might be important to you, but they're worth nothing if they actively isolate you from society and that is what the Red Pill CAN do. 

I'm not speaking from theory here either, this is experience, I used to be very judgmental when I was younger. I couldn't chill with anyone and for the last 2 years I've been working on breaking that barrier down. I'm still not where I want to be, I still get really judgmental and purposely isolate myself, which then leads to a mini-depression, wondering why I feel so isolated. Almost like a cycle.

I was downtown a few nights ago, and judging EVERYONE. A cute girl walked by, I'd go oh she's got a tattoo. Or that guy has a weird tattoo and is skinny, probably a loser. Or that girl is really done-up, she's probably annoying.

THAT kind of mentality will get you NOWHERE in life. **NOWHERE**. 

After judging people for a good half hour, I walked home and started thinking about what just transpired. I asked myself, what the hell do I want? If the girl that I actually wanted walked by, what would I have thought? 

And I answered that with ""Well she'd probably have a tattoo and I'd be like nope."" Then I said to myself, well what if she didn't have a tattoo, then would that suffice? I then said to myself, well then I'd probably think she wasn't artistic enough.

**THE IDEAL THAT I WANT DOESN'T EXIST.**

**THE WOMEN. THE FRIENDS. THE PERSON DOES NOT EXIST.**

And thinking they actually **DO**, will **ISOLATE** you. 

Red Pill is **GREAT** when it comes to understanding women but honestly it should have stopped there because the rest of the information is straight up wrong if you want to really make a dent in the world. It's absolutely paramount to learn how to interact and befriend many, many types of people and to do this, you absolutely **CANNOT** fucking judge them for not upholding your rare as fuck ""Red Pill"" views. 

Now, how do we re-program our brains, in order to be less judgmental?

**Here's what I've done --**

1. Get over yourself. Get over your views. Get over your politics. No one fucking cares. You don't matter and what I mean by that is not that you're worthless, but what I mean is that there are much more important and more interesting things in the world than yourself. Instead of being stubborn, be flexible, seek to LEARN about the world. LEARN from other people. LEARN from other walks of life.
2. Read more, watch more documentaries. The man who can be friends with anyone is a cultured man and a cultured man, wins. Learn culture. Learn about BLM, learn about feminism, learn about police brutality, learn about our history, LEARN. 
3. Go out and purposely talk to people that you don't want to talk to. Talk to that punk-rock dude, talk to the goth girl. Talk to the super-done-up girl. Talk to people you aren't comfortable talking to.
4. Reach out to people that you want to connect with on Instagram. Today I reached out to this heavy metal, emo rock type dude. Covered in tats, some piercings, etc. But I like his music and I think he's interesting. He's probably pro gay, pro trans, pro BLM pro feminism but WHO FUCKING CARES. I don't give a fuck about his views, a good person is STILL a good person.

And to come full circle, once you are a cultured, non-judgmental guy who makes friends with anyone you won't HAVE to go out and cold approach chicks to meet girls. You're going to be invited to parties, you're going to be out there making moves, meeting people, going to bars and clubs, hanging out with all kinds of people. You'll be making moves with your mission and moving up the ladder in life, meeting more and more people as you go.

***Girls will be asking YOU to chill, not the other way around. The non-judgmental, cultured man WINS. Period.***

Of course I deleted all posts and comments that I made in that sub just in case. 

Number 1: They are anti-self improvement. Anything I wrote there related to self improvement was spammed with ‚Äúcope‚Äù and downvoted into oblivion. There is no excuse with today‚Äôs resources for not improving you‚Äôre life.

Number 2: Almost every single one of them admitted to be socially awkward. That‚Äôs something that‚Äôs completely changeable. With a little help, going out and meeting people at clubs or bars and watching some tutorials, you can climb out of that hole.

Number 3: One of the biggest problems was that they are all mostly depressed. They treat life passively and when nothing good happens to them they give up and fall into depression. Without taking action, why would you ever expect results?

Number 4: This is the last and final reason as to why a lot of their users stay incels forever or end up committing suicide: see reddit user named IncelGraveyard. They drag each other down. When I was done with my experiment and made a post exiting the community, I was getting flooded by people spamming cope or saying that I‚Äôll be back next week. When I said no they downvoted me. They don‚Äôt want anyone to escape inceldom, they just want people to cope with.",30,1

Synthetic Masculinity,"Yesterday I remembered a quote from TRP that went along the lines of ""TRP is the imperfect substitute for fatherhood"". I then began to ponder about the imperfections of this new wave of masculinity, what exactly was the missing component? To answer this question I had to ask myself another question, ""When was the last time I felt natural masculinity""?

The last time I felt natural masculinity was when I went to a third world country for a few months, it was a small town in the middle of nowhere. There were no screens on every corner, no Fox News or CNN in your ear, and no large corporations looking down on you. It was mostly just green and small houses surrounding me, the air was fresh, the food was natural, even the sun felt different. Then night came and I sat on top of some boulders with some friends, a drink in one hand and a cigarette on the other. 

For the first time in years I felt truly masculine, I didn't need to read anything...I just felt it, strength, confidence and inner peace. Then I realized how over the top some masculine gurus seem from the outside perspective. 

Elliot Hulse breathing with his balls in an attempt to reach some sort of enlightenment. Anthony Johnson selling soap with a MAGA hat or George Bruno making coffee with chopsticks... none of that made me feel as masculine as being surrounded by friends and nature.

So what exactly is natural masculinity? It is a state of mind, it's being stable, level headed, relaxed, smiling in the rubble. I see none of that from the new people in this sub, constantly anxious, stressed, paranoid and neurotic. 

""What should I say to this girl? What books should I read? What do these texts mean? What should I wear?""

Society has made you neurotic and you need to get your natural state of mind back. Reading TRP will help understand the dynamics, but finding natural sources of masculinity will help you reach the proper state of mind necessary to be alpha. 

These sources are getting scarce but you can start off by joining a soccer team on the weekends, becoming a boxer, or traveling to another country for a bit. Let your testosterone take over your mind.

Game: Spot The Red-Pill,"Here's a Facebook whorror story I just read from one of my acquaintances.

It's a short story, but it's littered with confirmations of Red Pill theory. Can you spot them all?


***

Was just remembering something a few hours ago that I'd actually forgotten about.

I'm sitting in a fast food restaurant, next to a guy I couldn't stand. Didn't have the heart to break up with him yet but wanted to. Meanwhile, there's the guy's friend across from me. While I'm sitting there, trying to get my bf to stop clinging to me like Velcro, this other guy and I are stealing glances and smiles at each other.

It was very much like a romance novel.

That guy, I kept smiling at, mere days after that encounter, became my boyfriend and later, my husband. Sure, we've had our ups and downs but we've always known that we belong together.

*When things get tough, you fix it, not throw it away. Love CAN conquer all if you put in the work to back it. :)*

XYZ I love you!

Humility: Blue pilled men are children and should behave as such,"Children inherently know that they don't understand things. They instinctually listen to and trust anyone bigger than themselves and generally, things work out alright. Blue pilled men do not have these luxuries. 

Children implicitly understand that they are children. For a blue pilled man, seeing the depth of their own immaturity requires extreme levels of humility and self awareness. It requires distrusting many people who may genuinely believe they have your best interests at heart. You don't ask a homeless person for financial advice and you don't ask a dog how to train dogs. 

To be a blue pilled man is to be a child. Find the right teachers. Ask lots of questions. Listen to your intuition. Be the man you admire.

Adults accept children and their immature nature, but instinctively guide them. Adults in our soft culture also accept (and encourage) blue pilled men and despite their overt infantile nature, do not guide them. Your childish perspective is not any one person's responsibility.

Adults have an obligation to help nurture children into. Men are not obligated to help man-children become men. Blue pilled men must find their own way out. Accept the hierarchy and your place in it with grace. 

\*\*Congruence of purpose.\*\* This must be repeated. It took me years of just trying to smash plates to realise why this is stressed so much here. Pussy should never be your purpose. It's a symptom of being a man. I could explain it, but you've heard it before. This, one can only learn on their own through implementation. Drill it for muscle memory. Time under tension.

Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.",23,1

"For your own good - erase your online history, and keep it that way","First up - this is a long post and I apologise in advance. However, you should know that what I‚Äôm about to discuss has the potential to absolutely ruin your life. I‚Äôve seen it happen several times and the thought of it happening to me scares the living shit out of me.

For those of you that were otherwise unaware, every keystroke, pixel, and mouse click you enter online stays there for all eternity, for almost everyone to see. Most people DGAF about their online presence, therefore leaving it easily accessible to anyone who wants to delve into it. For those of you under the age of 30, you probably have every little mistake, transgression, or inappropriate conversation you‚Äôve ever had seared into the internet forever because of social media. Imagine the complete bullshit you talked about when you were 16, or the dumb Facebook posts you made when you were 17 still in High School. Older generations were lucky enough to exist before social media and the internet. For the rest of us, not so much. Almost our entire life is imprinted on the internet, and the fucked up reality is that people can and will use that against you.

So, what point am I trying to make you may ask? Well, it‚Äôs simple. Think about one person who is trying to ruin your life. Think about what they could find out about you online, and use against you. I‚Äôll give you some examples:

* Someone finds your Reddit account - your Red Pill posts about ‚Äúbanging plates‚Äù or cutting down on chronic masturbation are there for anyone to read. One senior RP guy was socially ruined because of this. Someone found out about his RP posts and IIRC he lost his political position.
* A racist joke you sent someone via Facebook message years ago (and you aren‚Äôt even racist, your dumb, underdeveloped 15 year old brain thought it was funny).
* A nude you sent your ex-girlfriend when you were 19.
* The viagra you ordered from an online doctor because you couldn‚Äôt get your dick hard with a new GF, and the receipt is sitting in your email inbox.
* That photo of you smoking a joint when you were 16 your friends put on Facebook
* Your personal journal you keep in Google docs in the cloud, which details your personal views, experiences, or any illegal activity you may have indulged in.
* Private WhatsApp messages to friends discussing your political views, which may not align with the world‚Äôs view (imagine if you were against the whole BLM movement and this got out).

Now, imagine if instead of 1 person trying their absolute hardest to gather this information, it‚Äôs 1000 people, or 10,000. Unless you are some kind of digital angel, there is likely going to be some kind of dirt people can use against you. Imagine you win the lottery and your face is plastered all over the news, and someone is jealous of you and tries to ruin your character as revenge. Imagine you‚Äôre being promoted at work and a co-worker is upset because it wasn‚Äôt them, so they find your Reddit account to use it against you. They send screenshots of your posts on /TheRedPill around the (majority female) workplace. Imagine you‚Äôre trying to sell your business and that racist joke you forwarded on 15 years ago on Facebook surfaces and makes it‚Äôs way into the local newspaper. Imagine you‚Äôre the CEO of a mining company and tens of thousands of climate change protestors are scouring the internet looking for dirt on you. Imagine you‚Äôre divorcing a cheating wife and her lawyer‚Äôs legal team uncover your online personal journal, detailing your plans to ‚Äúget even with the bitch‚Äù. Never underestimate the lengths people will go to just to fuck you over.

These examples might be somewhat far-fetched, but this shit is happening around the world on a daily basis. If you ever find yourself inadvertently shoved into the public eye, expect this scrutiny on a level 100000 times more. You don‚Äôt want to be the guy who runs for parliament, and then have your entire life‚Äôs work and legacy ruined by a dumb comment you made on social media 20 years ago when you were a stupid 19 year old kid. Take Donald Trump for example. I bet he thanks god daily that social media did not exist when he was growing up.

So, how can you eliminate the risk of your online activity being used as ammunition against you? Short answer - you can‚Äôt. Like I said, once it‚Äôs on the internet, it‚Äôs there forever. However, you can greatly reduce the amount of potentially harmful information out there, and take precautions to prevent more being created. I won‚Äôt go into too much detail on the specifics, however there is a /privacy sub here on Reddit which contains a ton of useful information. I encourage you to start there (I am not able to link on this post directly).

However, these are some of my personal main points:

* Facebook contains every message you‚Äôve ever sent, every photo you or your friends have uploaded, and tracks you even when you‚Äôre not using the app. Facebook is a digital cancer and should be deleted immediately. Right now, I could scroll through 10+ years of messages between my best friend and I and produce an almost unlimited amount of screenshots that would ruin his life, or mine. What if his girlfriend gained access to this and wanted to fuck me over? What if someone hacked his account to be able to see my own messages? You can never fully get rid of your Facebook account or remove those messages, but if you do delete your account, it then becomes slightly more difficult for that data to re-emerge. If you absolutely must use Facebook, either delete your account and start a fresh one, or severely limit your use of Facebook (and absolutely no discussing of sensitive topics on it from now on). I try to move everyone I regularly talk to onto a messaging app called Signal, which doesn‚Äôt track anything, is 100% secure, and can delete messages after X amount of days if you wish.
* Remove Google as much as physically possible. Did you know Google tracks every single search query you have ever googled? I‚Äôve googled some pretty fucked up shit over the years and would be mortified if that ever got out. Use the DuckDuckGo search engine instead. Also, ditch your Gmail. Move to a secure email like Protonmail, Tutanota, or literally anything else other than Yahoo/Google/Outlook/Microsoft. It is worth paying the extra $10 to $20 per year for a paid email service to ensure privacy. I personally use Protonmail and it‚Äôs awesome. Once you‚Äôve established your new email, update your email address on the accounts you use (e.g. bank account, government logins etc.). Then, backup and DELETE all the emails on your old account. Seriously, imagine if someone gained access to your email account? Literally your ENTIRE life is tied to it.
* I can‚Äôt stress this one enough, ERASE YOUR ENTIRE REDDIT HISTORY, and KEEP ERASING IT. It is so easy to tie someone to their Reddit account these days it‚Äôs almost laughable. Whether it‚Äôs the real-life doxxing from someone who knows you recognising a specific detail in your comments, your girlfriend seeing your Reddit username while you‚Äôre scrolling Reddit in bed, or someone with an ounce of technical knowledge who ties your IP to your Reddit account - JUST FUCKING DELETE IT. I will go in and overwrite/delete my reddit history every few weeks (I mainly lurk anyway), and every 12-18 months I will delete my Reddit account altogether and start a new one.

So that‚Äôs it. Hopefully my post has shed some light on how important it is to stay on top of your online presence, and why you should embrace privacy IMMEDIATELY. It could seriously come back to haunt you at any time in the future, or potentially even ruin your entire life (and by extension, your family).",183,1

Polyamory and The Real Truth about Desire,"It's been a while since I've posted here, but I had a wonderful example in my real life that I thought I could share with the board to provide some insight on the nature of women's desire. 

We all know about hypergamy, and the recent trend towards polyamory is this on steroids. Basically coming out as poly gives women the right to date and sleep with multiple people, even going so far as to have ""primary"" and ""secondary"" men living under the same roof taking care of one family. 

I have an acquaintance who has been very publicly polyamorous for a few years. As usual, she cycles through men anyway, but always had at least two or three she was involved with. What used to make me laugh was the days on her social media where she would post how happy and in love she was with one guy, and then literally the next day be showing herself naked in bed or kissing the other. Like a true liberated woman, right? 

So recently she latched onto a new guy who is pretty decent. Professional MMA fighter, good looking dude and runs two businesses, I know him from association with others in my city and we've hung out at the same events. He can basically get any woman he wants due to his SMV. 

They've been posting the usual sappy social media stuff about each other and how much in love she is. Then yesterday she comes out with a statement about how she's relinquishing her polyamorous lifestyle and she's satisfied with her new man from now on. 

I've corresponded with her in the past and simply wanted to confirm what I already knew - that this guy was obviously alpha enough to tell her that he wasn't going to put up with her banging other dudes. I was actually surprised he would even touch her after her history, but she's pretty hot and a ""sexual therapist"" so she's probably dynamite in bed. 

Her exact words when I asked what tipped the scales for her to stop her lifestyle with other guys: ""Just look at him. He's a god. And he told me flat out to make a choice so I chose him because he's the hottest guy I've ever been with."" 

What's the lesson here? If you're attractive enough you can get women to do basically anything you want, including going against their own internal policies of what they want to do. And, if you have complete outcome independence, if the person decides to shoot you down, that's okay - but they won't, because you're the best thing they can get and they know it. 

Women will use whatever dialogue they need to in order to justify what they put out to the world, even if it is completely hypocritical. And if they change their minds, well, they are a liberated woman, right? 

TL;DR: Polyamory only lasts for women if you're not attractive enough.",76,1

Looks Are Not an Excuse,"Over the past few years, I've noticed a recognizable uptick in the amount of comments that indicate one of two things, usually both:

1. There is no such thing as 'game' 

2. And if there was, your appearance would be the major, if not sole defining factor in 'game'

My first compulsion when I read this nonsense is getting frustrated, then wondering why I am mad about some dumb shit on the internet, then forgetting about it. But that nonsense sticks in the back of my mind. It sticks because I know for a fact that inceldom/general social ineptitude is at an all time high, coronavirus certainly doesn't help either. 

The sentiment expressed in point 1 isn't entirely untrue. 'Game' as it was popularized in the early 00's is actually fake news. There are no magic words or actions you can do to make someone fall in love with you. You can't hypnotize someone into sleeping with you, nor would you want to because that would probably be rape. But the truth is always more complex than the get-rich-quick goldmine that was early 2000's pickup DVD sets.

This might seem basic, but one of the fundamental questions that this subreddit was originally set out to answer is this:

""What do women want?"" 

If you are an incel like the above example person, you might say that women want the most attractive male possible to satisfy some evolutionary need. If you are a moron who doesn't think about things with any depth, you might not have an answer. If you are like most people, you will say that women want a man with vast resources.

The truth is very simple, and it is two fold

1. Women want whatever you want.

If you feel good in your own skin, if you feel good as a man and as a human being. If you feel like you have a purpose and you are on your own path, then your behaviour will say as much to the person you are talking to. 

2. Women operate like this, you ask them a question like ""can I get your number?"" Or ""do you want to hangout sometime?"" They then go into their body, ask themselves how they feel, and if they feel good they say yes, and if they feel bad they say no.

The combination of these two masculine and feminine mindsets create chemistry. 

That's it. That's the whole thing. That is literally how people work in most situations. I'm an average guy in every respect, and have pulled from cold approach plenty of times and had relationships with women way out of my league, because I held the above concepts in my mind. I have taken girls from guys that are much taller than me and better looking than me, and have successfully mentored young men that are more attractive than me, and watched them pull/get into relationships based on my advice.

So before you continue to write off every single post on this subreddit with a comment such as the ones I reference towards the beginning of this post, ask yourself this: 

Do you feel good in your own skin? Do you feel like you are a human being with value, and that you are own your path that you have set for yourself? If you answered 'no' to any of those questions, your issue with women might have less to do with your appearance, and more to do with your self defeating outlook on life.

Looks help, but they are *not. an. excuse*.

Becoming Interested will make you Interesting," If you decided to write down your thoughts for one whole day, 95% of those thoughts would be about **you:**

*I want a hamburger.*

*I gotta take a shit.*

*I should probably go mow the lawn.*

*What time is my barber appointment?*

Et cetera Et cetera you get the point. Everyone in the world is thinking **""Me. Me. Me.""**

With this in mind, everyone is also dying to tell someone about themselves. **Anyone.** Who doesn't like talking about themselves? Why do people buy Rolex watches, rent Lamborghinis and wear Gucci belts? Because they're expensive and they want everyone to know how successful and/or cool **ME** is. Now there are the few who appreciate the design of Rolex, the speed of Lamborghinis and the style the gucci belts add to their wardrobe, but that's for another discussion.

Now think about the last time you saw anything over the top like a Rolex, Lamborghini, etc. You thought , ""damn that's an interesting (insert nice ass gadget, toy, or buttplug here),"" and moved on with your (**MY)** day.

The truth is that **nobody gives a shit.** Nobody is constantly thinking about the guy they saw with the Rolex at Whole Foods or the Lamborghini driver at the cars and coffee. This should be a well known fact if you've been lurking here for a while, but if you're new then you should know that **nobody** but your friends, family and maybe your dog **gives a shit about you.**

So flip the script. Start developing a genuine interest in people and you will be amazed. Go ask the dude with the Rolex what drove him to buying such an expensive watch and observe his face light up and his thoughts regurgitate as if they've been sitting in his head waiting all day to come out. I've had some of the best conversations of my life by simply being interested and wanting to know more about someone else.

How does this make you interesting you ask?

\- By wanting to know more, you develop an open mind to *learning* more, and knowledge gives you the tools and resources to be an interesting person.

\- People will see you as someone ""different."" Not a lot of people are genuinely interested in others which is what makes this mind shift so remarkable, along with the fact that people absolutely love talking about themselves.

If you haven't read it already, ""How to Win Friends and Influence People,"" by Dale Carnegie was where this post got it's inspiration from. I highly recommend it for anyone and everyone.

Develop this interest but expect nothing in return. By doing this, you're becoming interested for the sake of wanting to know more about everyone, and people pick up on it. It's very easy to recognize when someone is talking to you because they want something from you, so expect nothing but a great conversation with someone new.

Yet I have never had a girlfriend in my entire existence (note that I‚Äôm considered an ‚Äòadult‚Äô so I‚Äôm not like 14 or anything).
Simply put, if you‚Äôre not white, doing all the things that this subreddit tells you to doesn‚Äôt work. It works if you‚Äôre white - these things would simply improve your game (as a white male)
If you‚Äôre asian, when you ‚Äòdo these things‚Äô, it‚Äôs simply not the same. Surely it‚Äôs better than nothing, but on the other hand, most westerners will view you as ‚Äòedgy‚Äô, ‚Äòwannabe‚Äô and ‚Äòtryhard‚Äô. 
I‚Äôve noticed this all the time, but in particular, when I did my hair to my liking. I noticed people staring and snicking (no cap). They were most likely thinking in their heads ‚Äòlol, he‚Äôs trying to look fashionable.‚Äô You get my gist?
There simply is no escape for us. ***in the western world that is.*** there‚Äôs places a lot better for asian men outside the Anglo sphere (which is shitty anyways. 99% of girls here are attention seeking cunts. All that comes to my mind are stuck up girls holding a Starbucks in one hand while texting someone in the other. (Also Karens and feminists but I don‚Äôt include those in the ‚Äòdating pool‚Äô.)
PS. There are a small amount of cute, dateable and non-racist women. As such, 99% of them are taken.",34,1
Preparing To Win II,"## Winning By Way Of Analogy

It isn't good enough to just make an appearance. You have to make the effort for your appearance to be memorable, impactful and insightful. No one in the history of tribes or civilisation has ever shown up once and become lord-king. Status is bought through an exchange of influence and favours, which in turn leads to respect and placement within the hierarchy of life.

Who de we prefer; the host of a party or the fool who criticises the music choice at the party? Do we turn to the fool and ask them what music would they prefer, or do we ridicule them for their disrespect and mock them because they don't have the influence to make their own party?

When we view the hierarchy of masculinity as a tower, which along the outside has steps winding it's way to the top, we see at the bottom individuals who are:

* Too afraid to make the ascent
* Unaware of their ability to climb the tower
* Have been kept down by others
* Want to topple the tower to a level field

At the top we know are the most successful, the hosts and the doers and the charmers. The bottom is plagued with feminists, white knights, predators, betas, losers. These people know their worth, or lack thereof and lash out at the ones climbing the tower with their spite and criticisms and call it 'justice'. Their losing mindset is so deeply installed into their being that they cannot even comprehend winning as a positive action that they could take for themselves *today*.

And so it is within and without every culture or group we take part in. In every group you integrate with, you start at **zero**. Always remember you start at the bottom of the tower and it is through your efforts alone that you will begin to climb the new hierarchy. Soldiers don't scrub the floors to be humiliated, frat houses don't haze for a laugh, they do it to separate the useless from the useful, to instil the respect for the men that came before them because **they did it as well** and now **they are winning**.

Women, betas, losers. These are the people who will target a strong and proven hierarchy. They would rather pick it apart and pretend they are being noble or righteous than prove they have what it takes to be a part of the group.

Are you that person? Are you the infantile teenager who throws their mouth because 'fuck them!'?

Or are you a man who sees the value in a hierarchy system, can contain their frustration at set backs and will remain patient in their mistakes until they have the approving nod of the group? Are you the man that is prepared to win?

The greatest lesson and discipline a man can learn is when to hold his tongue. Words can be cheap when used without temperance, the speakers words become transparent and forgettable. Know when your words will be valued and when they will be discarded and your opinion and knowledge will carry more weight with your group.",14,1

"The nature of covert goals and why they keep you outcome enslaved -- No, you do not actually do every single thing in your life to win the ultimate prize of a woman and get laid.","**TLDR : There's faking it and then there's making it. And then there's BEING it. The more direct your goals are, the less they serve as a tool to meet some other covert goal, the more authentic they will be, and so will you.**

We've been sold on the idea that every single thing we've ever done and wanted to achieve in history was because of the ultimate reward of women and sex.

The reality is that sex is the biggest thing on your mind because a) You're raging with hormones as your body seeks women for sex, companionship and kids and b) Sex is lacking in your life, which is usually a symptom of many other things lacking in your manly self.

The idea that sex is the ultimate prize of all endeavors and goals is a clear example of a covert goal - a goal where you say you want one thing, but in reality what you really want is covert and hidden. The overt, direct goal is merely in the service of the covert goal and your passion for it is entirely outcome dependent on whether your covert goal is ultimately met or not. 

This is essentially a covert contract between you and your own goals. And it stops you from being direct and authentic with both your other goals and your goals of getting the sex and women you need.

Let's say you wanted to become an astronaut, a doctor, a sportsman, race cars or build cars, make musical instruments or fly planes, build muscles, become a scientist, run your own business, or just make a lot of money, build a big house and travel the word -- you can trace many of these goals right back to when you were a kid and you were just fascinated and attracted to these things as they were, for their own sake. 

Those goals were then free of any covert contracts. Many of your most authentic goals came from the discovery of innate gifts, or ideas or something that really impacted your life. 

No you did not do ANY of these things just to ultimately get laid. You did all these things because they allowed your self to express its true potential. The actual reward of achieving your goals is in the very fulfilling experience of achieving them itself and the lessons and experiences gained in the journey. 

Had you made a woman the ultimate prize for any of these goals, your motivation would have evaporated the instant you were rejected by her, and back down the slippery slope to beta valley of stagnation you would  have gone. You would end up doing things that weren't authentic to yourself for her sake, and eventually something within you just builds up resentment and screams at you for deceiving yourself and making covert contracts in your life.

I'll admit, many people have been really motivated by the prize of a woman and sex. The whole beta indoctrination we do to ourselves is built on the covert goal of obtaining a woman. A reward is a great motivator, but our emotional minds are simple and fail to realize the difference between a goal, an outcome and the side effect of achieving a goal. 

So people go the gym, lose weight, groom and style up, develop gaming skills, and the entire list. The problem is at the point of origin which hasn't yet been fixed by authentic frame -- they're doing all this not out of genuine desire for themselves, only for her. In their own minds, they and their goals and their lives as men are all still worthless unless they gain the prize of a woman - so they remain needy and do not develop the genuine abundance that women are really attracted to. THAT is the subtle sin that must go in the end.

In other words, your frame at the point of origin is your innermost conditioning, and that is what really ends up creating your life even if you have seemingly done everything else right. That is what determines what actually ends up happening. For e.g. Why fear and insecurity are such self fulfilling prophecies.

It is precisely the lack of honesty and authenticity in covert goals that force you to abandon your own frame and try to fit into a woman's tenous and ever changing one, to the ultimate frustration of both of you.

Instead, try to recognize the intrinsic worth of your goals and what you gain truly from achieving them. Don't make a covert contract by asking ""What's the point?"" The moment you've asked that question, it means what you want is really something else. This lack of genuine desire will not only not allow you to give your best towards your goals, it'll guarantee you won't learn to love what you do and it'll sabotage you from meeting both your overt and covert goals. 

Ultimately you won't truly love yourself with covert contracts and covert goals. And no woman is going to plug in that hole you've built in yourself. Covert goals will keep you feeling that something's still not right or missing and eventually you'll feel so empty you'll suffer a mid life crisis. You might then end up dropping your  goals as you could no longer live with the feeling that what you wanted was something else and you were just creating resistance within yourself the whole time.

Recognize that sex and women are a need within you and bring them honestly out in the open. Becoming attractive starts out as a means to an end, but down the road it trickles down deep enough that it changes to being the expression of your best self as a way of being. And that is when it becomes truly powerful to actually transform your life and attracting what you needed. A counter intuitive way of getting what you want, but its the authentic one. 

Once you are at this level where your new life is now a way of being and not just a step up to get women and sex, and your goals are direct ones instead of tools to serve some other covertly hidden end, you are truly outcome independent. You have gained the awareness to realize why you do what you do and what you need to do, and now others are in your frame rather than you trying to fit into others' frames. You don't see yourself as merely tool to obtain someone else or something else (and therefore ultimately worthless), but recognize that you are really the prize and the one who is worthy of the best of what you can offer. 

When you do not value yourself, you will seek validation and the rest of the world to give you that value instead. And that is the root of why you're ultimately not authentic at the deepest level of your being, and why you cannot value anyone else either. And that is why you fail to get what you need. Instead of the one becoming more than one, you're acting as though you're zero and want the world to make you more than zero. And you are doing this to yourself. Therefore you also can take responsibility for yourself.

Now you truly value yourself and all aspects of yourself and can see yourself honestly in the mirror. Your goals are now simpler, more direct and more authentic. You are not tortured by constantly second guessing yourself ""Why am I doing this ultimately?"", so your motivation is again pure and simple. You actually truly honor your goals and what you're doing to achieve them right now, and by doing so you truly value yourself.

You see how everyone is busy chasing their real covert goals indirectly underneath all that they say and believe and why that pretty much ensures a mid life crisis and burnout or disillusionment sooner or later. It is actually necessary so that they may truly find the opportunity to confront themselves honestly.

It's absolutely fulfilling in itself when you achieve the goals you dreamed of achieving - whatever they are. When I look back at my best achievements those were complete in themselves and did not need sex as a prize to ultimately validate them or the journey. I'm pretty sure getting that rocket to land automatically on a droneship was completely fulfilling and amazing in itself - why enslave it to something else. Sex is fulfilling in itself as well. 

It is true that women and sex might have given you the much needed kick start to becoming the man you were meant to be, and we have to be ultimately grateful for the lesson, but ultimately you must flip the frame the other way round and be the man you were meant to be as your natural way of being, to actually get the life you wanted, and beyond.

That's the difference between faking it vs making it, and then going further beyond to BEING it.",41,1

V Taper and Height - The Pillars of Sexual Attractiveness in Men,"I notice that this is an area in which there is significant debate among guys.

Some guys think it‚Äôs all about the face. Some guys think it‚Äôs all about getting edgy tattoos. Some guys think it‚Äôs about dressing well.

The truth is, based on my own analysis of various guys I‚Äôve coached in addition to observing seemingly ‚Äúugly‚Äù guys with model tier girlfriends, women are most attracted to the following 2 things:

1) V Taper - every so often, I come across a tall guy with a handsome face who says ‚Äúlooks don‚Äôt matter‚Äù because if they did, he wouldn‚Äôt have any problem with women... and every single time, with ZERO exceptions, this tall guy will have narrow shoulders and look like he never lifted in his life. It really is a huge handicap to your looks, even if you‚Äôre 6‚Äô5‚Äù, handsome face if you have narrow shoulders. It‚Äôs the most prominent thing people can see about you along with your height when they first meet you. Just like guys like women with wide hips and small waist, many of the seemingly ‚Äúugly‚Äù guys you see with 10/10 girls have good V Tapers. Once you see it you can‚Äôt unsee it.

2) Average Height or above - I find that 5‚Äô9‚Äù is the cutoff point in the United States. Dating gets so much easier for guys if they are past that average mark. Every inch above is bonus of course, up to about 6‚Äô2‚Äù or 6‚Äô3‚Äù, in which case you reach freak level, but this height must be accompanied by a proper V Taper. A 5‚Äô9‚Äù guy with muscles and a V Taper will beat a 6‚Äô3‚Äù tall skinny dyel nerd every time.

So the next time you wonder why seemingly ugly guys (with no money) are with gorgeous women, remember that women primarily prefer these 2 things and your life will be a lot easier. Remember, American women don‚Äôt really care about face that much. It‚Äôs the V Taper and Height that are most important.

Lift like your life depends on it and work like hell on social skills and other areas if you‚Äôre short",15,1
Applying for a bitch like applying for a job.,"Many comrades here have experience of  searching  for a job into labor market.

"""If You Want To Break Up With Me, That's Fine""","*""Indifference is worse than hate... indifference is king.""* \
        ¬†- Alexander Agassi

Between first and second period in my high-school, students would be given a 30 minute ""recess"" to socialize, catch up on homework, or speak with teachers about their grades.

I was on my way to practice the piano for a moment, when I spotted a cute girl I was familiar with, on her way out of a classroom. Krista was her name, an Australian with pretty blue eyes. I dated her twin sister briefly, and while things didn't work out we remained on good terms. As for Krista, I thought she was just as pretty, and since I had a few minutes to chat, I decided to go and say hi.

This story is not about Krista - for she is the mere catalyst of the future scene my current girlfriend would be making.

As Krista walked out the door and made a right into the hallway, I called out her name. She turned around and smiled, ""Hey.""

We chatted for a little bit about random topics, until one of Krista's friends suddenly kicked a soccer ball toward her. 

In an attempt to stop it, she put her foot down sideways in front of it, and the ball ended up rolling over her foot and flying backwards. She used to be a forward on our school's soccer team, so she was a little embarrassed.

Me being the type who loves to tease, I said ""I see you've been keeping up with your soccer skills!""

She laughed and we made a turn into another hallway, then started chatting.

From around the corner, my current girlfriend Angie, walked by with 2 of her friends. They noticed me talking to Krista and then Angie let out a big sigh.

She approached me.

""Hey, ya, I think we need to talk.""

""Okay, excuse me Krista,"" I went to Angie while Krista stood on the side to what I can only assume was eavesdrop. Girls love drama!

Angie spoke somberly, ""I've been doing a lot of thinking, and my friends and I have been talking, and I just don't think you take me seriously.""

I nodded and continued listening.

She waited for me to respond, and after realizing I wouldn't, she ended with, ""I need to break up with you.""

I said, ""Okay, thanks for letting me know."" Then went back to talk to Krista.

Angie began crying, and one of her friends approached me, asking how dare I do this to her.

I was confused, like what the fuck? The trio walked away. I thought about calling out to Angie and saying, ""I'll miss you,"" but I decided against it.

Like many women, they love to victimize themselves for attention. Angie was no different - she went to the main locker area where kids hung out during our break time and sobbed loudly. Krista and I could hear her from down the hall. I decided to go remind her she had no reason to cry.

So I walked over to her, where quite a few people were ""comforting"" her, simps and fellow stacy's alike. I said ""Angie lemme say something to you,"" to which one of her friends replied, ""you've done enough talking."" What? I barely said a sentence.

""I'm not talking to you I'm talking to her,"" I said as I moved through the group.

I placed myself in front of Angie, who surprised me by instantly cleaning up her act. She looked into my eyes for a second, then looked at my feet with her arms folded across her breasts.

""Listen Angie, it's okay if you wan't to break up with me, because in the end all I care about and all that should matter to you are your feelings.""

She threw herself into me in a strong hug.

I continued, ""In the end there is nothing I can do to stop you or change your mind. All I can do is just cherish the memories.""

She pulled back, then stepped back, her face contorted with half anger, half disgust.

""What?"" She sneered, ""There's nothing you can do?""

""Yeah, so if you wan't to break up with me, that's fine.""

""What the fuck do you mean the memories! You're just making up a break-up strategy!""

Her last sentenced confused the hell out of me, so I ignored it and just addressed her first point. 

""Yeah of course I'll cherish the - hey hold up. Everybody, is it *wrong* of me to hold onto the memories of my now Ex-Girlfriend? Can someone tell me if I'm doing something bad here?""

A few people cackled, and glances were exchanged between the crowd.

""Okay, can someone tell me what she meant by a breakup strategy?""

At this point Angie's friends were trying to drag her away, but she stood firm, determined to hear out the group.

No one said a peep. ""Clearly Angie is upset as she broke up with me and started crying. Can someone tell me where I fucked up here?""

A guy said ""You never should have dated that bitch in the first place Cuz!""

Now the group began laughing, and Angie finally let her friends drag her away, but not before calling me an asshole.

Why Your Bar/Club/Party Approaches Don't Lead to Sex,"Due to the pandemic askTRP hasn't seen many bar/club Game questions lately. But with things opening back up in some locales, now is a good time to revisit the topic.

A few months ago, a user posted asking for advice on how he could do better at the club scene. I'll paste the first part of his post:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We‚Äôll meet girls at the club, exchange numbers and shit and then hangout over the weekday. Doing stuff like volleyball, going on boat, or going for food and drinks.  
&gt;  
&gt;It‚Äôs fun, but hasn‚Äôt resulted in banging for any of us. I don‚Äôt mind because I‚Äôm adding to my friend group and it‚Äôs all fun. Good social proof too.  
&gt;  
&gt;What can I be doing instead to take these girls home and bang them (on first night meeting at club, and after exchanging numbers) I live about 20 minutes from downtown and most of the girls I meet also live far from downtown.  
&gt;  
&gt;That‚Äôs one problem I have. Because meeting girls at a club, I‚Äôm that Fucking dude. But if I meet them and friends at the beach 2 days later on a weekday, it‚Äôs a different vibe, you know? Not super flirtatious. More friendly.

I will review exactly where this guy is going wrong, because I see the same mistakes repeated again and again in similar posts. These fatal errors are entirely the result of unexorcised Blue Pill conditioning, which I will explain.

**Here I will describe exactly how to get laid in a club setting.** My method is so easy that  even the smartest software developer on the planet couldn't possibly overthink it.

# What Women Want At the Club

Girls aren't at the club for conversation. Even if they could hear all about your latest engineering project over the music, they wouldn't give a shit. Doesn't matter if she goes to MIT or the local community college. **Girls go to the club to drink, let loose with their girlfriends, and potentially find a hawt fun Alpha to have sex with.**

At any club/dance bar you have a main dance floor, which is ringed by tables and bars. The latter areas are filled with Beta males in goofy plaid shirts standing around awkwardly drinking Bud Light. They watch the action and passively wait for something good to happen for them. 

The main dance floor is packed with chicks, gays, and hawt fun club guys. Let's analyze that last group (inspiration taken from GayLubeOil's essay ""Cynical Implementation"" which I recommend).

Hawt Fun Club Guy is often dumb as a rock, which is why he's uniquely suited for the club setting. He doesn't have the capacity for intellectual conversation. He doesn't overthink the approach because he doesn't do much thinking in the first place. He's just there to party and have fun. He's a **man of action.**

He may not be the best dancer in the world. In fact, he might be terrible. But he's too stupid to know or care. He's just letting loose like the girls and gays. I personally know fuck all about dancing, that I can tell you. You wanna know what's worse than being a shitty dancer? Wading onto the dance floor with drink in hand, and just standing there like a dweeb. Might as well tattoo ""NOT FUN"" on your forehead.

Obviously in addition to being fun, you also have to be hot. That's why I call him **Hawt** Fun Club Guy. If you don't lift, groom, and dress well, then I don't know what to tell you other than stop reading right now and revisit the self-improvement section of the sidebar.

# The Approach

Once you spot a group of hot girls that you'd like to have sex with, mosey your way on over. More experienced PUAs have written all about openers, which you can search out on your own. Honestly it doesn't matter what you say, she probably won't hear it anyway. All she sees is your vibe and what you look like. Again, *Hawt Fun* Club Guy.

At this point you might not even have to open, some girl from the group may invite you in. Other times you don't say anything, you lock eyes with her and you just *know*. It's difficult to describe. These are social cues that you pick up on with experience.

It goes without saying that if the body language signals rejection, you just rinse and repeat with some other group.

# Getting Laid in 20 Minutes

So you found a cute girl and you're dancing with her. Maybe you leave the dance floor to go take a shot with her. She's clearly feeling it. Everything seems to be going so well for you.

Most guys drop the ball here. **They're loss averse due to a scarcity mindset, so they don't risk making a serious move.** They drag on the dancing way too long until she's sweaty and tired. They start making out with her on the dance floor, completely diffusing the sexual tension. They bring her into a corner to try to make conversation with her. And worst of all, they ask for her number and then just go away. I have to quote a now-deleted EC, because what he said is too good not to paste verbatim:

&gt;Talking is automatically in the female frame. Action is the male frame.  
&gt;  
&gt;For the most part, when you are talking to a woman, especially one you have just met, if you are sitting there talking, you're in her frame. Period. And the longer you talk, the more disinterested she will get because the conversation is helping her learn more about you and take the mystery away.

All of this stupidity comes from Blue Pill conditioning - you have to ""get to know her"" and ""build comfort"" before she will have sex with you.

Utter horseshit.

**All you have to do is interact with her on the dance floor for a short period of time before simply saying ""Let's get out of here.""** She'll say goodbye to her friends, and you leave. That's it fellas, it's really that simple. I've never actually timed it, but I'm certain that this process takes no longer than 20 minutes. Obviously you have to have good logistics, which is covered in basic sidebar material.

# Don't Dither

**The more you drag on the interaction, the more you shoot yourself in the foot. Young girls just want to live in the moment. They crave spontaneity. Be a man of action.**

Don't get her number and wait a few days to text her like the guy above. Women are emotional. They may be ready to go one night, but the next day they will be ice cold. Your window of opportunity is finite. Dither, and the opportunity will pass you by forever. **Move quickly and decisively.**

Obviously you don't have to be autistic about it. If she won't leave with you, then by all means grab her number and move on to the next one. If you encounter token *soft resistance*, e.g. she says something like ""in a little while"" then continue Gaming and try again in another 15-20 minutes. But really, make your intentions clear as soon as possible. It's all upside and no downside.

Don't be the guy who snatches defeat from the jaws of victory.

# Timing

This approach works best when the energy is at its peak, say midnight - 1 A.M. Depends on nightlife in your city. Whatever the case, it probably won't work when the night is just getting started. Old school PUAs used to talk about heading to the club an hour before closing. I've done that myself with a large measure of success. 

# Going Solo

Many guys complain that they don't have any friends to go out with. *Au contraire*, I say that's a good thing.

When you go out with a big group, you aren't approachable. How many times have you been approached by girls when out with a bunch of friends? Probably not often. It's too intimidating for chicks. On the other hand, I'm often approached when I'm out alone or with one high SMV friend.

Social proof is irrelevant to the approach that I outline here. Again, all that matters is that you're hawt and fun. If she asks where your friends are (shit test), just say they stayed in tonight.

# Additional Notes

* Roosh and other PUAs emphasize not putting too much effort into groups of two girls. Most chicks aren't going to leave a friend totally alone. You also have the jealousy dynamic when you're trying to close a broad and her friend isn't getting any attention. Maybe some of you have had success with it, but I've always found it to be a waste of my time. **Focus on groups of three or more girls.**
* Like I said, it's better to go solo if you just want to get laid. But **if you do go out with friends, make sure your collective SMV is high.** Many PUAs advise not to go out with Alphas and/or better-looking friends, but I've always found this to be totally counterproductive. Girls infer a lot about you from the company that you keep, because Alphas generally hang out with other Alphas.
* Inevitably a few people will comment that I must be handsome for this to work. I won't deny that (*Hawt* Fun Club Guy), but I'd say that I'm no more than an SMV 7-8 on Looks alone. I'm average height (5'9"" on a good day). But I have a decent sense of fashion, groom (stylish haircut and beard), and busted my ass in the weight room to get to this point. Those Black Pill faggots should just go suck a cock already, because that's all the action they're going to get. 
* I prefer vodka soda as my drink of choice, the main reason being that vodka doesn't smell strongly on one's breath.
* **Also, don't get drunk.** Nothing more really needs to be said on that topic.

# Conclusion

As Rollo has written, society is increasingly divided into sexual and non-sexual zones. Sexual zones are places like Tinder, the club, college parties, and travel destinations like Las Vegas, spring break locales, and cruise ships. Ain't nobody going to those places for the culture; they're going to have fun and potentially get laid.

Every guy has his own customized approach that works for him, but the same principles apply to all of these sexual zones. **Be fun, be hawt, and move quickly and decisively.** Most guys at least vaguely understand the first two, but the Blue Pill conditions them to move slowly and indecisively. If there was one thing that held me back in my pre-Red Pill days, it was this fallacy.

Many guys in askTRP have only partially unplugged with regard to women's feral nature. It is totally feasible, indeed common, for the hawt fun guy to go from meet to bang within the hour. **She's in the club to get laid, so don't make this any more complicated than it has to be.**",92,1

I honestly feel overwhelmed with the amount it takes for me to be attractive to women,"I'm 5'7 and is around 81 kg (178 lbs) and I've been trying to lose weight for a while now. Before, I had thought that if I had just lost weight to be the regular weight, it would be enough for women. This was basically how it went for my sister (who got bunch of attention from boys after she went from fat to normal weight) but after browsing through many forums regarding this, I found out that it's still not enough, especially since I'm a man.

The thing is, for men, the acceptable percentage of body fat is much lower than women. Men have to have at least 13% body fat to be considered attractive, but women can have up to 24% to be considered thin, and the number is even higher in reality since men are much more lenient with the body fat in women and can still find women with higher body fat percentage attractive.

Also, I found that being thin just isn't enough for men. You have to have a toned body with definitions as well to be considered attractive.  

It is *not* true at all that women are less visual than men, but it's just that there's such a narrow way men can be considered attractive so they aren't going to attract to most men. I'm honestly jealous that most women have it so easy being attractive and so many different types of bodies of women can be attractive, but yet they still complain about it.

I hope my rant is not too beta for you guys. I'm at my weakest point right now",76,1

The Fundamental Way to Make People (Both Men And Women) Attracted and Magnetized By You.,"Do you want people to get butterflies in their chest the day they're going to meet you, or even days before? Do you want them to fidget as they're talking to you, say stupid shit cause they're nervous and crack nervous smiles in an attempt to gain your approval? There is a fundamental principle to doing this:

**Being Powerful**

And to be more specific, being powerful in the social aspect. To be powerful this way, you need to have a strong reputation. You need to be famous and respected by a large amount of people. It doesn't matter if you're a famous actor, scientist, athlete, war general, etc. What you do specifically doesn't matter as much as the social prominence that you have gained as a result of your actions. You should have others speaking praise in your name, talking about you in the dinner table and seeing you succeed in social media sites. The larger your influnce, the more powerful you are. People are attracted to power in an instinctual level, which is why they'll feel a strong emotional interest for you.

The reason for this has sociobiological explanation. Having social power within the tribe results in/is correlated to having surivival power in the jungle. The leader of the hunting pack has the strongest reputation in the tribe. He got to be the position of leader by cunning, intelligence, wisdom, physical strength, etc. He proved himself by his actions. This has caused such a person to be favored by the tribe and subsequently, to gain reputation. We have now come to associate this individual as powerful through his reputation alone, without the need of testing the ablities that made him socially reputable in the first place. It's an example where correlation has come to also indicate causation in human instincts, where social reputation has come to imply surivival power.

And of course women love this kind of power. It's a strong sexual trigger. Women feel attraction to rockstars not because of how meaningful the lyrics of their songs are , as much as the amount of fame they have accumulated.

In the book ""48 Laws of Power"" by Robert Greene, this concept is given in the 5th law:
""So much depends on reputation - guard it with your life. Reputation is the cornerstone of power.""",2,1
Every Bitch is a Movie Star,".....in her own head.


To understand women, you simply internalize that she is the star of her own movie - and every scene runs on feelz.


Everything that happens to her over the course of a day becomes a narrative that is later dramatized in her head. The screenplay becomes reality, and ""drama"" is a critical aspect of the show.


What happened is of secondary relevance, if relevant at all. What mattered was how she FELT. 


Women absolutely love drama. It is better for her to be pissed at you (or feel any strong emotion), than not care - therefore, all you guys that are Super Serious Business, ego invested, and/or emotionally disconnected fail hard. There's no excitement in that. There are no feelz.


Don't misunderstand drama. Drama is useful. Some of the naturals I know are frankly histrionic people, but women are obsessed with them because their personality brings EXCITEMENT. She might hate his guts, but immediately gets a dopamine rush when her phone buzzes and it's him. 


Feelz are the currency the movie star treasures. Good game is all about making a story, laced with emotional highs.


You bounce venues on dates because it ""feels"" like you got to know each other so fast.


You keep an air of mystery because it makes her ""feel"" curious.


When I lived in nyc, I told girls to meet me under the clock at Grand Central Station. Why? Having to find each other and meeting in an iconic location is just like....a movie. When went  blabbing to her friends about me, I guarantee you it started, ""he told me to meet him under the clock, I was nervous but we found each other through this huge crowd, it was so much fun!""


Those are feelz. That is the screenplay. I gave her all the emotional ammunition she needed to create the fantasy of me and Our First Date.


So look boys....if you want to get to the next level, just remind yourself - this girl really thinks she's a movie star. Don't let it be PG rated - bring the excitement and feelz, fuck with her head a little, and you'll be amazed how many girls will be obsessed with you.",204,1

I shittested girls for the past month. Learnt that girls have absolutely 0 self-esteem and are just a few words away from lashing at you.,"What will be a girl's typical shittest when she's attracted to you? Of course it depends on how aggressive the person is, and it ranges from playful and teasing banter maintaining a decent amount of respect, to straight up offensive comments about your job, your physique, your face or even sometimes the length of your penis. 

Well, gentlemen, for the past month I stopped giving a fuck about dating and started experimenting with the whole thing because why the heck not. I'd first build rapport with the girl, dodge shittests and make her interested, then start firing typical shittests any guy would shit their pants in front of. 

Obviously I lost girls more than I won, but I learnt an ultimate truth about the female nature: they absolutely can't handle criticism one bit. Just another day in my life for them is the end of the world. Here are a few examples. 

I wanted to drop the bomb on one of them by saying that her pussy was a bit too wide for me during sex. She was a ONS and her face immediately changed and felt like shit and in just 5 minutes she asked me if I could gather my shit and leave, which I gladly did. 

I criticised many girls body fat %, height, skin tones, game, occupations, and overall appearance. 

I told some they were a little bit too fat for me, others they should try harder with the tan, they still look white, not enough makeup to cover the double chin, not interested in them anymore, I have a girlfriend, others that they're doing a job because they have no set of interesting skills that qualifies them for a better one, I told some that I bet they do/say that shit to every boy they meet, that they're the type of girls who would sleep with whomever they encounter who's remotely as attractive as me, that whichever creative bullshit they're into is not interesting after all and better find something more useful, I'm sure shittests if done to me I'd be able to find a comeback or two. But most of the time what I'm met with is silence, angry gaze, instant ejection, instant lash, ""OMG HOW DARE YOU?"" And so on from a hurt ego. 

I think it was interesting and now I'll just go back to normal game lol",102,1
Democracy and feminism are one and the same thing,"**Core democratic-feminist scenario**

* *Feminist:* I don't need a man.
* *Interviewer:* Why?
* *Feminist:* Because the government will give me money.
* *Interviewer:* And where does the government get the money from?
* *Feminist:* From the men, of course!

**Democracy always leads to feminism and is therefore the same as feminism**

Women cannot be allowed to vote because in that case they will seek to implement the core democratic-feminist scenario.

In normal circumstances, money naturally flows from men to women, and in exchange, sex also flows from women to men. The democratic-feminist scenario, however, shuts down the flow of sex from women to men: men are simply made to work for nothing in exchange.

**Can we allow just the men to vote?**

Also not.

If we allow men to vote, sooner or later, enough stupid men will be found to extend the vote to women. Hence, even men cannot be allowed to vote.

That simple principle is how the old, ancestral systems worked: there was no democracy, or any voting by men, if only, to prevent them from extending the vote to women.

The ancestors were obviously right.

Democracy is automatically also a feminist project. Democracy along with feminism inevitably crash and burn in a sea of violence. It will cost a gigantic number of dead bodies to solve the problem. Therefore, once the problem solved, we want to keep it solved.

**Conclusion**

It is insufficient to merely wage war on the western feminist State. More is needed. As a matter of survival, anybody who ever tries to reintroduce democracy must be treated as a dangerous enemy.",24,1
"You cannot be outcome independent, unless you are","  

Following the story of Mike, the seduction tactics and methods guy (Cannot put the link of it in the post, you can check it out on TRP or my profile- ""Shortcuts will cut you short""), the saga shall continue, with our boy John as the main character. John is kind of new to the whole TRP philosophy. He is extremely pleased but also intrigued with this different way of seeing things. ‚ÄùGoing to the gym to get more muscular in order for women to find me more attractive? I thought women would love me for the weak chump I am!‚Äù  ‚ÄùFocusing on my career in order to earn more money and be able to provide for my family and loved ones, as the leader I shall one day become? They told me women will not care about my financial status.‚Äù And the list goes on. After some analyzing the new information he was bestowed with, he decides to finally take action. He puts on some muscle mass, gets a promotion at his job and things seem to be getting better and better. So he finally gets the confidence to start approaching more women, but his fear of rejection seems to be grater than in the beginning. ‚ÄùThose bastards lied to me! Look at how much time I‚Äôve spent getting fit and trying to earning more, yet women still reject me!‚Äù John knows about the term of Oneitis, yet he didn‚Äôt truly understand it. He didn‚Äôt understand that even if he was bettering himself and the quality of his own life and health, all that he had in mind as a result of this journey he had begun, was getting more girls. That‚Äôs where he was wrong this whole time. 

Women are not the cake, but the mere cherry on the top of it. Women are the shake after a good workout. Point is, the workout is still great, the shake afterwards is a bonus. The same way a guy starts having a Oneitis after investing more and more into a girl, the same thing applies to this principle, but at least he has done something good for himself in the process. ‚ÄùI‚Äôve bought you flowers, why aren‚Äôt you having sex with me now?‚Äù transforms into ‚ÄùI‚Äôve worked so hard to get these abs, why aren‚Äôt you sucking me off yet?‚Äù. Good thing to have abs, yet the woman is only receiving the message that you are a fucking tryhard, doing everything for the appreciation of the opposite sex, and a tryhard never ‚ÄùJust gets it‚Äù. The more things you do to make girls like you, the less you will enjoy your interactions with every single potential partner, because you come from the same frame as in the beginning, where you ‚ÄùNEED HER to like you, otherwise your fragile ego will not be pleased‚Äù. John is in that situation. Poor fucking John didn‚Äôt understand that the more he gets to enjoy his life, the more people will enjoy being around him, women included. The more you get to enjoy your life, the more girls will like you. The goal is enjoying your life and having the one you desire, not having girls desire you. That will happen in the process.

As a really cool guy called Epictetus once said in a book called ‚ÄùThe art of living‚Äù: ‚ÄùNever depend on the admiration of others‚Äù. That is something not in our control, and as long as you depend on things you cannot control, you shall live a life of misery and bitterness. Not even Brad Pitt would be able to lay every woman on this planet. There is no secret way of getting every woman to like you. The only fucking secret is ‚ÄùGet your life on point, realize you are able to enjoy it without anything related to sex, then sex will come‚Äù.Do not get me wrong, I am not preaching ignoring the female nature, on the contrary, you should be aware of it, but because you are aware of it you should realize it‚Äôs not in your power to control any woman‚Äôs feelings. Live for yourself, because you won‚Äôt get another shot. 

Don‚Äôt be like John. Live for yourself. Strive for things out of your control, but do not depend on them.",37,1

When you boil it down to the nuts and bolts, achievement comes down to two and only two things. The first is

#Desire1

When you wanna succeed as bad as you wanna breathe, only then will you be successful. Think about the things you want most in life. What are they? Looking like a Greek God? Making seven figures? Fucking 100 women a month? Being an outstanding father to your children?

Be honest with yourself, how strong is your desire for those things? If it‚Äôs not a fire that ignites every molecule in your body there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll never obtain it.

Whatever it may be, the only way you‚Äôll obtain it is if you want it as bad as you wanna breathe. How bad do you fucking want it? Do you want it just enough to chase it when it‚Äôs conveniently within sight? That‚Äôs not gonna be enough, not even close.

You need to want it so fucking bad you think about it every single day, you couldn‚Äôt remember the last day you went without it on your mind. You need to want it so fucking bad you‚Äôll be willing to sacrifice even the shiniest temptations for it. You need to want it so fucking bad, one of your greatest fears and worries is not having it. 

Once you find a way to spark that level of desire within, you‚Äôre over halfway there. The only thing that‚Äôs left is also pretty damn simple: discipline.

All 600 million might have failed to impregnate your mother‚Äôs egg. Or any of the others ‚Äì hypothetical brothers or sisters ‚Äì might have made it instead of you. But, no, you were the one who ventured through the ultimate assault course ‚Äì because a woman‚Äôs body regards male sperm as an alien entity that must be destroyed, just like some virulent infection ‚Äì and you succeeded where all the others failed.

You are one in six hundred million! You have beaten lottery odds. So why are you so humble, so beaten down by life, so cowardly, so willing to accept the shit treatment you get? You are already a remarkable warrior, you are already a god who has achieved greater feats than any of the most legendary heroes.

Achilles was nothing compared with you. Live up to what you have already achieved. Make your life the reflection of the supreme struggle you endured and over which you have triumphed.

I [30M] am having trouble understanding my fiancee's [26F] anger issues," 

TLDR : My dating and engagement experience which didnt end too well.

Soon after I met my fiancee, she moved to another city for work. Most of our dating days were on Facetime. While I saw some anger issues in her during the time, I let it slide thinking they were resulting due to long distance relationship.

Fast forward to February 2020, she finds a job in my city and moves in with me. Things started to haywire from that point with little arguments every now and then. The arguments would be for some really trivial hairline triggers for instance, say I didn't turn on the heater before I the started the car. If I didn't walk fast enough from the car to the store she we would say ""You will make me go tan"". These arguments will result in a ""no talking"" period for about a couple of hours. Every time something went wrong, it could be a dish, it could be assembling an Ikea table, its always ""your fault, you can't do anything right"".

A month later during one such argument, she slaps me. I couldn't stand it and I hold her hands to pin her down going ""How dare you slap me"" . She starts to cry and tells me how me holding her hand hurts her.""You are a man, I am a woman . Don't you know that I am weaker? now look who is crying! I am"". Within the next one minute, me holding her hand becomes the topic of argument and the whole blame turns towards me. I feel guilty and apologize.

Each time such an episode happens, I try to tell her the next day ""Do you understand what you did yesterday? Do you know how toxic this is? Imagine raising kids in such an environment"" . She realizes that she took it a little too far, apologizes and says it will never happen again. I feel relieved that she finally realized what happened and is genuinely going to try and not repeat it.

10-15 days pass and they would be the most beautiful days.

Again something really trivial would trigger her and this time she would resort to throwing things at me, her phone, flower vase, sometimes pick up the knife, put it on her throat and go ""You'll be happy if I die , right? Isn't that what you want?"". One of the days she got angry she would say ""I am going to call 911"". It was mentally so exhausting. Her angry episodes would last for 4-5 hours and there will be a lot of name-calling like ""son of a bitch, motherfucker etc"". She would belittle me saying ""I am going to leave you just like that (snaps fingers)."" and ""You should be happy that you got someone as pretty as me"" . At the end of it all I would be told that I am the reason for her anger and that I do not know how to handle her anger.

There was one instance where she spat on my face while I held hands to prevent her from throwing stuff. Some other time she would bang her head against the wall when I held her hands.

She hasn't had any issues at work or at college due to such behavior. Is this abuse? How do I handle this?",39,1
"""TRP my ex just hit me up and said hai what do I do???""","Time and time again we see this pop up over on AskTRP. Boy likes girl, boy breaks up with girl (or vice versa), girl texts boy post break up and casually asks him what is he up to. 

Boy then hops on Reddit like a sperg and asks random men on the internet what his ex wants and what he should do. 

So that last part isn't natural. I'm gonna go ahead and make that clear. Most well adjusted men (hell even teenage boys) knows wat the fuk she wants. 

You've fucked her more times than she can count. She's horny, lonely, or the new man she with ain't hittin it like you did because he doesn't know her body. 

So what is she asking? 

""Hi, may I please have your dick again?"" 

That's all she's saying. It's in the subtext. 

This us operating off the principle of always assume attraction. Except now it's your ex, so it's even easier to understand why she would want some more of what's already familiar to her. 

---

After I cheated on one of my exes she took it pretty hard (understandably) and I broke it off with her. 

There was about 3 weeks of radio silence, and she texted me and said ""Hey, do I still have some mail over there?"" 

All I read was ""Hey, can I come over and get some dick?"" 

It's just that simple. Doesn't matter if she's dating someone else or not, if she initiated the break up or not, if you cheated on her or not, they WILL come back for more. 

It's just sex. I don't consider it ""digging through trash"" or whatever the fuck. Just get your nut in and be done with her.",39,1
Avoid Texting,"It's March. We've all got comfortable in our couch waiting for the lockdowns to end. Women and men aren't able to meet each other. As a result, a lot of guys like me broke the rule of texting only for logistics. 

It's the end of July, lockdowns are ending and so should the texting. 

Scenario #1 - Online Dating 

1. If she doesn't give you her number, unmatch. Do not negotiate her desire to give you her number. 
2. If she gives you her number but says it's too early to meet. You either meet now or you don't. If it's not now, hard next. You don't want to spend your time waiting for her to change her mind about going out with you.

Scenario #2 - Plate/Fwb

1. You are meeting regularly - Some texting apart from logistics is perfect. She got a cute puppy in her status/story? Congratulate her and keep it short. 
2. You aren't meeting at all - it's been weeks, she has her own reasons/excuses. You don't reignite the spark because there is no spark left. She hasn't met you in a while. Hard next.

Scenario #3 - LTR

1. LDR - Breakup and move on. You can't revive the same level of intimacy as before on text or calls or even video calls. That shit doesn't replace the physical proximity! 
2. Communicate clearly to your LTR what you want. If you're like me, you'd clearly state you don't like texting.
If she adapts, she's in your frame.
If she adapts but still craves attention, use your judgment and operate within your frame. Avoid being in her frame by texting just because she wants.
If she doesn't adapt and wants too much of your time and attention through texts, drop her status to plate/fwb or soft/hard next using your judgment.

"Why I am trying to be more ""ugly"" to attract the women I really want","Tldr: try to appear more masculine instead of what you personally think looks good or what other people have told you if you want the most beautiful women


The most beautiful and feminine women seem to end up with men who are ""ugly"" by some standards. It's the truth. At least often enough that it can't be ignored anymore. It's not just a fluke or freak accident, he's not just rich, he doesn't have the most amazing personality...  guys who are above average in looks see this and get so frustrated because it doesn't make any sense. Oh she must be crazy or something then. What we view as good looking is a man with somewhat feminine features, made popular by Hollywood and modelling agencies run by feminine people.

I'm pretty good looking in a traditional sense, like Don Draper or Elvis.  Have been told I look like a movie star more than a few times. A lot of straight guys have told me this which was kind of strange at first, but they were just being friendly in the way guys know how to be, compliment the other person. You might be thinking ""oh great, another piece on trp written by a guy who has it easy"", but that's not true. 

Women who are very good looking are not quick to give a handsome man compliments on his looks. She lives the life of an attractive person and knows how annoying this can be.  She just assumes you already know you're attractive and that doesn't add anything to say it.   Instead she wants to see who you really are and if you are ""alpha"", ""tough"", masculine, driven, passionate. You're being vetted for the long term relationship or long term FWB. 


 She will test your confidence more to see if it is authentic or just because ugly women throw themselves at you. A lot of ""good looking"" guys do not want to deal with this testing because they don't understand it and will think she is just a bitch. This can lead to settling for less beautiful women who are eager to please you much sooner. That can mean just for one night stands or for the LTR. You might think ""Yeah there are more beautiful women out there, but this girl is so nice and caring and those hotter women are too entitled."" But this is just the myth that ugly society has pushed on people so they don't end up alone. 

Hot women are actually approached less in person than ugly ones. When they are approached it is often by men who are afraid to be sexual and direct, and instead are seeking her approval. Will she talk to me for a couple minutes?  Can I make her laugh?  Can I show her that I'm a nice guy?  And this is all subconscious by the way. You might have every intention of seducing her, but this programming kicks in as soon as the interaction begins. And then you look for a way out of this friendly needy interaction, awkwardly ask for her number and she says she has a boyfriend. Good looks are not going to come close to making up for that in any way shape or form. 

So here's the truth about looks in men: the most beautiful women will end up with men who are not what we see as good looking, but guys who appear intimidating to other men. She wants someone who will keep those^^ guys away from her, for her survival. This is her instinct.  She is supposed to be the pretty one, the cute one, the one who is told how good they look all the time by friends and family and strangers. You are supposed to be the man who can protect her from the enemies at the gates. 

Yesterday I shaved my hair off to 1/4 inch. I don't look like a movie star anymore. I look like a cage fighter, like a soldier. Lean and mean. This isn't the first time but I'm embracing it instead of growing it out again. Might even cut it shorter still. And I'm only approaching the hottest women, going direct, right from the start. I'm the guy who goes for what he wants in life and has confidence outside of some trendy haircut. 
  
A grown man should never be called ""cute"" like a little puppy dog or child. You are better off being scary. Embrace your masculine features and attract your opposite.  The jacked beast of a man gets the slender beauty. 

For illustration purposes, here is Justin Timberlake, who transformed from ""pussy in boy band"" to actually respectable as a grown man. You can see he was really feminine while being marketed to the 8-18 year old girl demographic, and the huge contrast when he played roles with tattoos, short hair and beard. And there's a lot in between as well to see how different one person can look, even staying at mostly the same weight.

Possessiveness is attractive and is needed for a long term relationship?,"I‚Äôve been reading novels catered toward young girls recently cus I was curious.

I find girls are much more honest with their nature in these novels, I particularly like reading novels where the author obviously studied some sort of psychology.

The guys in the book represent ladies ideal man, most are bad boys there are some others too, but they all seem to share one trait.

They are possessive of the female lead which seems to be an extreme turn on for the girls.

Of course the guy has to be a high smv man, i‚Äôll give some examples on possessiveness.

she‚Äôs hanging with another guy ‚Äòfriend‚Äô she WANTS you to be possessive of her.

Saying shit like ‚ÄúHe wants to fuck you, you know.‚Äù 
or just aggressively making out with her in front of him makes her wet.

TRP and It's relationship with philosophy,"&gt;That's great and all but how will this get me laid?

That comment summarizes the most of this sub-reddit.

For a place called the ""Red-Pill"" it is clearly lacking self-awareness.

The film that this Reddit is inspired by is called ""The Matrix""

The book that inspired ""The Matrix"" is called ""Simulacra and Simulation"" by Jean Baudrillard 

He is one of the greatest thinkers on the late 20th century.

\----

The reality is we're men who wanted to get pussy however we over time realized there is a deeper whole to fill.

That whole being the one society has put us in. 

TRP is a simulation of a simulation. As according to Jean Baudrillard on his comments on ""The Matrix"" 

&gt;"" The Matrix is surely the kind of film about the matrix that the matrix would have been able to produce."" \~  Jean Baudrillard

After you become a pussy slayer you'll have the ability to become a philosopher.

It is true. Being a philosopher dose not get you pussy.

You just have to find the right door.

Women and their role in the promotion of Human Rights,"There is this concept of feminism and ""human rights"" and ""my body, my rules"" that some women show more appreciation to than others. They read books, listen to podcasts, engage in activism, and have merchandise from those merchants which promote these things. This is particularly common in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Berkely, Chicago, and many college towns.

But there are also women who wouldn't wear such clothing and wouldn't share such material on social media. Not because they are against humanitarianism but because they prefer to show what they have rather than what they have not and that the educated woman doesn't engage in the vulgarities of the mob and would rather do something more productive.

In recent months, the people have flooded the streets with dissension and among them, we can find feminists and women ""fighting for human rights"". But we also know that other women are working, reading books, exercising, cooking, and catching up with their friends and acquaintances.

When the feminists tell her that she is uneducated and lazy, she upbraids them and says that they are reckless and that she has things to take care of.

Then there is a third class, the class of women who are neither interested in feminism nor interested in a respectable professional and personal life, but instead crowd the bars and tattoo their bodies everywhere. These women have an overwhelming amount of men approach them and they sleep with a Mike one day and a John another day. When you ask them about ""human rights"" or to join a protest, they say that they don't want to contribute to dissensions and negativity and that such an approach is shameful for a ""lady"" to engage in.

But this is because, due to their vanity, they are afraid of disappointing other people with their opinions, they prefer to be the fun girls of the crowd. The party girls and the ones who are ""classy"". But when they are at the bar and cafe, instead of behaving like women of respectable families, they are audacious, engage in base masculine profanity, photograph everything and show no ladylike table manners. Such is the character of these women.

Alas, what is a good woman? Isn't she also a good citizen? Isn't she also a respectable person to men? To her fellow women?",31,1

The Real Female Dating Strategy,"One of the things I hear so often from men struggling to comprehend The Red Pill, is that they feel like hypocrites for deploying a strategy on the poor helpless opposite sex. As if we aren‚Äôt already fighting a battle of the sexes with one arm tied behind our backs. Some of these men forget the reasons that they came looking for The Red Pill in the first place. They failed in a relationship of interaction with a female due to;

Exhibiting beta behaviors

The light switch effect

Hypergamy

Solipsism

Failed shit tests

Loss of frame

Oneitis

The list could go on‚Ä¶

They struggle with the concept of AWALT. They only scratch the surface that these behaviors exist, but they never go further down the rabbit hole learn *how and why* they exist. They don‚Äôt want AWALT to be true because it changes everything. They feel dirty for being here and their gag reflex spits the pill out.

The sidebar material is critical to read and understand. In addition to the sidebar material I suggest more research is necessary to learn and understand the female behavior. I recently came across a website for women.  [www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com](http://www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com/). Those of you are still struggling to comprehend the magnitude of what you are facing when it comes to sexual strategy with women, spend about a half an hour on this page and you will be back here with a notebook ready.

Online dating insights during quarantine,"Some background: 35, in process of divorce, job pays 200k+ at local university, located in metro area of 900k

I discovered red pill over a year ago in a struggling marriage. During the process, I started cheating and realized I did a horrible job vetting my ex. Finally called it quits in March and waiting for trial in October to finalize everything. That is when I started meeting new people at possibly the most inopportune time. Here are some of the things I've learned.


**Online Dating**
Don't take this seriously at all. So many women have shown me their profiles and the 50-100 messages they have waiting from guys. Just joke around and be prepared to talk to a lot of women to set up 2-3 dates a week. Also your profile should be pictures of you doing stuff, not stupid selfies or other masturbation. So much of it comes down to timing, luck, and things you can't control anyway. Also this quarantine stuff really means nothing to women. I've met close to 40 in person (ages 23-41) over the past few months and nobody really cares about staying home if the ""right"" person comes along.

Another quick related note - if someone doesn't agree to meet the first time you ask or suggest a different time to meet, next them. Otherwise you're wasting your time.


**Meeting in Person**
Obviously follow red pill philosophy about push and pull, joking, etc. But only ever commit to a drink at first. Probably 20% of who you meet will catfish you, so you need to be able to leave at a moment's notice. Also, if it does go well, have a plan to close. Mine is that I play guitar so I invite them over to play for them. Just make sure it isn't the same thing that a bunch of other people do. For example, where I live, everyone loves fishing and hiking. So instead of asking people on those types of dates, I make sure to make fun of that shit when I first meet someone.

**Vetting**
This is the biggest change to my entire dating philosophy. I used to look for reasons to have a relationship when I hung out with women in the past. Now I only look for red flags. There was a post on here about women imagining an alpha male based on all the best characteristics of their previous relationships. I believe a guy should actually do this as a prerequisite for entering a LTR. And that list should be real personality traits like independence or a genuine sense of humor, not garbage like ""nice"". If nice is the best characteristic of a person or a way others describe them, they actually suck and aren't interesting. Once you truly internalize that you are the prize, then you won't settle for nice. You'll move on at a moment's notice and have no fear about not being in a relationship.

If you do start vetting one girl seriously, I'd still recommend meeting others. There have been a few times I've spent a week or two with a woman to think she has potential. However, if you keep meeting women and/or spinning plates while vetting, you'll much more readily identify red flags and not get yourself into a suboptimal LTR.


**Spending Time Alone**
This is absolutely essential. If you are always surrounded with friends, family, and dates, these people are going to tell you how great you are. Take some time alone for real personal reflection instead of filling up your calendar with dates. I used to go to church but now am opposed to most organized religion. However, I found some daily devotionals that I listen to in the morning every day. I'd also recommend meditation and even journaling about your emotions that day. The only way to truly grow is to identify your shortcomings and make them different.


**The Path Forward**
After meeting lots of people and an n-count of 16 during quarantine, I have learned that companionship should be the goal. Find a person who you like spending time with until you don't like spending time with them. Sleeping with as many women as possible doesn't bring fulfillment, but most men actually have to do that themselves to figure it out. Instead, appreciate the fun times you have with a woman until either they want more than you want, or you want something else. Remember that there is no fulfillment in women - instead they are companions to the fulfillment you create for yourself.",112,1

The error of Gentlewomen,"My mentor Nietzsche in his legendary book Human All too Human wrote:

**Gentlewomen think that a thing does not really exist when it is not possible to talk of it in society.**

**Don‚Äôt be humble and expect females to admire your greatness ‚Äì prove it.** 

**Talk about your abundance and social status and compete with her**, so:

* ¬∑ Brag about your life experiences. 
* ¬∑ Brag about your education.
* ¬∑ Brag about your determination and ambition.
* ¬∑ Brag about your earning ability.
* ¬∑ Brag about your attractiveness, your health , your sexy masculine body and your expensive clothes and cologne.
* ¬∑ Post some photos in your social media from your exotic trip to the Buddhist monastery petting tigers. 
* ¬∑ Invite her to a famous expensive club if you can afford it and post pictures after that.
* ¬∑ Tuck her in such a way that she can‚Äôt wait to share it with her girlfriends, after all boring sex is of no value for her because there is nothing to talk about .

One of the best ways of bragging is through social media because it works for you 24/7, effortless and free of cost.

**Make them jealous and stir their curiosity.**

- String them all together in a sentence.

Congratulations, you are now funny.

This is simple low-brow humor that will make any average family guy era girl laugh. You are a living cut-away narrator. 

Here is a variation: 

- Begin your sentence with ""Note to Self,"" or ""This reminds me of""

- Repeat earlier steps

Her: Haha Aftsov you're funny. **Touches my crotch**

Me: Talking with you is like taking a cold shower with Natalie Portman.

Me: It's hot as hell but a struggle to get hard.

Her: OMG shut up I hate you so much!! *Comes closer to me and pushes my arm, eyes wide and smiling.*

1st date shit test?,"My family and her family tried to play matchmaker. I‚Äôve known this girl all my life but we never gave two shits about each other, so I thought. I beat them to the punch and asked her out. Her response, ‚Äúwait, really?‚Äù She seemed eager and excited. 

4 hours later we met up for drinks. Ended up back at her place and things started to get personal. She kept trying to ‚Äúfigure me out‚Äù. Me being the stoic person I am I held frame best I could. I‚Äôve had quite a few girlfriends and she known this, and it‚Äôs really all she seemed to wanted to talk about. Ended up asking me if anyone‚Äôs ever called me a narcissist, I responded by grabbing my keys and telling her I‚Äôve got to go. I don‚Äôt really know where this came from, bad past relationships? This is when she realized she fucked up, and I fucked up by not actually leaving. An hour later we we‚Äôre making out and things we‚Äôre getting wild. We didn‚Äôt have sex but left on a good note. 

We had text conversation for about an hour after I left, which she assured me she wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äútrip‚Äù over me.

What the fuck do you really want?,"What the fuck do you really want?

No, really. Ask yourself. Do you know? Do you have a tangible set of conditions, situations, day-to-day activities, and/or physical things that you're moving towards?

Why are you here reading this post? Why are you on this subreddit? 

I've been subbed here for years. I developed my own sexual strategy in parallel to reading TRP. I don't post much, I occasionally lurk, but most of the time I'm just doing what feels natural to me. 

I perused some of today's posts this morning, and I notice a theme that has been growing steadily in prevalence that I personally feel detracts from the beneficial parts of this community. 

Women. Women are a core part of TRP because TRP is for men. Without the duality of women, we as men wouldn't need this community. 

However, correct me if I'm wrong, this community isn't for discussing women. 

Women are not the goal of pursuing the pill. This place isn't to post about your threesome experiences or how you negged a girl until she fucked you. This community is for men to lift eachother up. For men to help eachother with shared wisdom and experience. 

We have a bad reputation because we attract weak men. The goal, in my eyes, is for these men to recognize the flaws in their logic. To recognize that they are the reason for their own unhappiness, to a degree. To recognize that we are bred into apathy and consumerism, born into a system that is exponentially stealing our autonomy to pursue fulfilling things and have the life our fathers had. I think the goal, in a sense, should be to recognize that the man of yesterday is no more, and by simply taking accountability for your own actions, owning your shit, learning to love yourself, and to stop FUCKING wanting a MOMMY YOU CAN FUCK, you will become a man. A stabler man. A happy man. 

Yes, when you're stable or happy, women will fuck you. Sometimes more than one will fuck you. I would be lying if I said my own ""bad luck"" with women isn't what brought me here many years ago. I only started getting laid when I realized that putting sex on a pedestal is pathetic. I hope this post will either help someone, or stimulate discussion on self actualization as men and how we can improve the community.",41,1

"Fear not rejection, fear not getting rejected enough."," *Incoming slightly lengthy post so sit down, relax and grab something. Done? Now, let‚Äôs sperg out on asktrp, read the sidebar and plate single moms our way straight into this*.  

Rejection: The biggest part holding a lot of guys back(new guys) is the fear of rejection. 

But when a girl rejects you... what did she actually reject? 

Did she look at everything that you have done, everything that you will, everything that you succeeded at and failed at, all the opinions of your friends and family and then make a judgement call on all that? 

Nope. 

What happened was she made a judgement call on the snapshot you gave her. 

That snapshot was a 1-3 minute interaction you had where all she knew was your name and maybe another one or two superficial details. 

She rejected that. Not you as a whole person. 

She rejected the snip-it you presented. 

Maybe it was your body language, tone or maybe she was on her period or your hair reminded her of her ex. 

Girls are retarded and illogical. Man‚Äôs nature is to always find logical reasoning behind everything but with emotional creatures, it‚Äôs not always possible.  

 *Always let the woman decide why she rejected you, don‚Äôt do the work for her*. 

But if you knew it was one of the former things that felt off (ie something you can change like tone and posture) bare that in mind and adjust next approach.  If not, just move on. 

But lets say you get rejected. 

What happens next? 

Absolutely nothing. 

[Did you die ](https://youtu.be/bjlr3vfU300)

Did anything remotely important change? 

Nope. 

You still got everything, your body is in one piece, you still got your health, your money and 
your family and friends are still well (until some old woman with the last name that rhymes with  *Hilton* comes after you). 

The world just keeps rotating. And always will. 

Do you think the opinion of a 110lb 5‚Äô3 girl changes anything?

Vast majority of men didn‚Äôt reproduce: at one point only about 1 in 17 men did. 

 [I tried working out what that was as a percentage but common core failed me.](https://images.app.goo.gl/8LysRVqY3c269mFr8)

Only a tiny minority passed on their genes. You are these very genes, this very blood...descended from literal warriors and hunters. 

Your ancestors killed sabre tooth tigers for a living. 

So does it make sense to fear the opinion of someone that is vastly weaker (10x less testosterone than you) and shorter than you and bleeds once a month? 

It‚Äôs just a girl. A random girl that you barely knew and she you. 

*But...Apollo...I don‚Äôt like being rejected.* 

Well, in the wise words of Vas/Sir kolbath: 

*1st rejection may feel shitty. 

10th rejection may feel like something.

50th rejection feels like nothing*. 

You have to go through them to de-sensitise you to it. 

Understand that the feelings you get are valid, but they won‚Äôt kill you. 

Best way of training yourself would be telling yourself ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm still alive and well, this feeling of rejection didn‚Äôt hurt me‚Äù upon rejection. 

You‚Äôll only be truly free when you have nothing to fear. 

One thing I can promise you is that your closing WILL get better. 

(There was a guy here with a FR where  he had thousands upon thousands rejections to bang one girl, now his closing rate is sky high). 

With practice, nothing stays the same forever. 

Literally nothing. You are guaranteed some level of improvement. 

Practice playing tennis and you‚Äôll become better at tennis; you‚Äôll hit more shots consistently and hit better shots. 

Same thing here. 

*Fuck you Apollo, fuck your Greek pantheon, fuck this red pill shit, I can‚Äôt do this shit. I hate getting rejected!* 

Okay, but what other path do you have? 

You could just only go for girls that are very DTF right off the bat, and will make it very obvious for you. 

But this is a tiny minority. 

Girls communicate covertly so naturally they won‚Äôt make it obvious or very easy for you and most girls that will sleep with you will be somewhere near neutral/lukewarm about you. 

Going for only these types of girls WILL mean you are leaving girls on the table. 

You can be the guy with the 100% CONVERSION RATE or you can be the guy that‚Äôs had the MOST CONVERSIONS.  

I‚Äôm a Brit but I‚Äôll use an example the yanks will get to show which option one should choose: 

One of the best, if not the best, basketball players in the world, Michael Jordan: 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I‚Äôve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I‚Äôve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I‚Äôve failed over and over and over again in my life. That is why I succeed.‚Äù

Conclusion: 

Rejection is natural and part of the game. It‚Äôs like salesmanship, you got to go through the No‚Äôs to get to the Yes‚Äôs. 

When you get rejected, it‚Äôs not you as a whole that‚Äôs getting rejected, it‚Äôs that short interaction. 

Your genes came from the best warriors/hunters the world has known, so use them...they didn‚Äôt get passed onto you just for you to be scared of a tiny, fragile girl.",87,1

The Journey Through Hell,"In the poem *""Inferno""*  from the book *""The Divine Comedy""* it tells the journey of Dante through Hell.

Hell is depicted as nine concentric circles of torment, located within the Earth. The journey through hell, represents the journey of the soul toward God, with the *Inferno* describing the recognition and rejection of sin.

&gt;'Abandon hope all ye who enter here'

This is the message inscribed on the gates of hell when Dante enters

Now, forgot all the religious mumbo jumbo and focus on the message.

# You have to go through hell to get to heaven.

Now, when men begin the journey of self-mastery; abandon hope for others.

Hell is around you.

You cannot change others fate, only your own. As a man you must accept this and move forward.

# Comments on the Journey:

1. ***Starting the Path and Giving up***
2. ***Why Life lacks Meaning***
3. ***The Ending is meet with a beginning***
4. ***The Sacrifices of Greatness***
5. ***The Individual .vs. The Collective***
6. ***Accept the Pain***
7. ***You're alone, till you're not:***

***

***Starting the path and Giving up:***

* When you first start cold approach you will be rejected by many women , and say it's not worth it.
* When you first start going to the gym you will give yourself excuses not to go.
* When you first start learning a new skill you will say you're not good enough.

All these doubts......

Work is not easy. Do not hope it will be easy. You will only be let down.

For many who want to improve, however lack the energy; you break the chains.

You cannot move towards the path if you are chained down by bad habits.

Break bad habits by enforcing good ones. Do not punish yourself. Only steer back to the good.

To build good habits, start slow and build momentum. Momentum is key.

It is better to start then to have never have started at all.

***

***Why Life lacks meaning:***

it lacks meaning for you simply lack to give it one.

Many do not think for themselves. They allow others to determine the narrative of their life.

One needs to ask themselves the questions no one else does. This is how one can start to think for them self.

Life is a gift and you need to learn to make it one worth having. You have to give it value.

It does not matter what your peers or random men on the internet think.

Do what you want to do. It may not be easy, however nothing worthwhile usually is.

***

***The Ending is meet with a beginning:***

Every goal you achieve will be met with a new beginning.

Death in itself is a process with a beginning and a end.

Let the ways of old fade and start up the mountain.

There will always be mountains to climb. However, This does not mean you shouldn't climb them.

&gt;The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart.  
&gt;  
&gt;Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself, forms a world.  
&gt;  
&gt;\~ Albert Camus *(Myth of Sisyphus)*

*****

***The Sacrifices of Greatness:***

in order for you to achieve greatness it will take sacrifice.

One will have to either sacrifice:

* Time
* Money
* Vices
* Bad influences (whether it be friends, family or beliefs)

You get what you put in.

You have to invest in yourself.

No one else will, until you do.

***

***The Individual .VS. The Collective:***

Many will try to shame and belittle you.

That is their right, it is also you're right to prove them wrong.

Many people are in groups for their afraid to be alone. Most not all, *(obviously).*

You will have to go against the tide occasionally.

The best thing you can do is learn how to ride the waves.

***

***Accept the Pain:***

Pain is going to always be there, so do not act as if it's not.

Emotionally and physically you will meet trails.

Meet them with acceptance. not contempt.

Without pain the value of successes would be absent of worth.

Pain is the cost of greatness.

***

***You're alone, till you're not:***

Friends will come and go.

Pussy will come and go.

You will be alone for long periods of time.

You will find yourself looking out into the outskirts of the city seeing people mindlessly walk into stores. While the sun shines among the trees and the wind sings softly to the earth.

That is fine.

The road of greatness is the road less taken.

However, not be afraid to say hello to others when passing by.

&gt;‚ÄúThe story of life is quicker than the wink of an eye, the story of love is hello and goodbye

&gt;*...until we meet again*‚Äù

# Conclusion:

The journey through hell is what molds a man into what he's going to be the rest of his life.

You did not ask to be born, however you will be asked for an answer as to why.

First Threesome,"**Intro:**

It's been a long time coming. I just had my first threesome, and I didn't realize how ridiculously and laughable easy it was. A little background for those that don't know me. I'm 5'6, early twenties, I lift and am decently built. I'd consider myself a solid 8 physically, despite my height, (and have been told so by women I've fucked) all things considered. I wasn't always an 8, though, I had to work hard for where I'm at in life currently, and I'm still just getting started.

**Body:**

Currently, I have my main girl (Jill), and I have about 4-5 girls I can fuck at a moment's notice, and then I have my Sunday girl. Sunday girl (Jenny) had to cancel last week because of school, so I suggested we meet up the following Saturday instead of Sunday. She said it was her birthday and that she was down. Later on, Jill hit me up and told me she was free on the same Saturday. This is where the fork in the road usually develops for me, I would have had to cancel on one of them, but I wanted them both.

It all started with a simple question. After Jill hit me up, I ask Jenny ""do you like girls?"". She said she wants to try but never been with one. Afterwards, she immediately asks, ""threesome?"", which I reply with ""threesome for your birthday ;)"", and sexual talk ensues.

Jill is bisexual, so I knew this wouldn't be a problem on her end. I tell her I'd have another girl come over later on during the night and she wanted to get to know her a little beforehand, so I give her Jenny's contact information and they hit it off pretty nicely. In my opinion, they're both smart women pursuing decent educational studies and were well-versed conversationally, so they had a lot to talk about.

Skip over to the day. I was nervous as fuck, as I've never had two women I've fucked that knew I've fucked them both interact with each other. I didn't know what to expect. When she came over, it was an instant connection between the two. Both of them were a little nervous. I brought them up to the room and they sat in the bed. I start making out with Jenny then shortly after I make out with Jill. Then I push their faces together and they start kissing passionately. While they're sucking face I grab a shot glass and we start taking shots. I had Jill buy us some cupcakes (it was Jenny's birthday, after all) beforehand and we had a lot of fun with that. It was hot as fuck watching Jenny lick frosting off of Jill's tits, and making them both get on their knees with a cupcake on my hand while they sucked my dick. I alternated fucking them both (rough as fuck, of course) throughout the night until eventually Jenny had to go home.

**Conclusion:**

It's very easy to have a threesome with two girls that you're currently fucking, you just have to make sure they're open to the idea of being with another girl. Once their juices start flowing, every thought of something going wrong just disappears.",37,1

Now, this guy clean knew that he had this interview **three weeks ago** and here he was, 45 minutes before crunch time telling me he wasn't prepared.

'I don't know any of the leadership principles.'

Look them up online.

'I'll never memorise them in ten minutes'

What happened to the 45 minutes?

'I can't do it, I'm going to fail.'

Yes, with that attitude you are... With that I loaded up the principles on my phone and showed them to him. He took a brief look before sighing and going back to his defeat.

Now I wouldn't usually give people like this the time of day and let them run head long into their own disaster, but this was such a pitiful display from him that it sparked my interest in just what he was doing to himself. So for the rest of the day I thought on his situation.

**It is easier to prepare to lose than it is to win**

So in the three weeks he had to prepare for the interview, he admittedly did nothing, only he *did* prepare. He prepared his excuses and his circumstances. Aside from my conversation with him, I found him going from person to person informing them of his situation. Not a single person offered him the lessons he needed, instead they might as well have patted him on the head and told him he was doing his best. 'Just think positive!' they cooed calmly at him. What is worse, he responded better to these platitudes than he did to me trying to help him revise.

So *why* did he do this? And why do men all over the world set themselves up to sabotage their opportunities? Because it's easier than being successful and having to take on the responsibility of leadership. It would be easier for him to face the initial humiliation of a failed interview with his plethora of excuses than to step into the shoes of a leader and be responsible for the operations day in day out. He is scared of prolonged failure, so he ruins his chances before he can even try.

I personally love interviews, they are a trial by fire and a good indicator of who the person is. It is common for interviewees to be nervous, to ramble in their answers, but when a strong candidate enters the room and lays out coherent thoughts and questions of their own the format of an interview really shines. You can be the latter person, or the interviewer themselves, if you just do the damn preparation. If you have enough respect for yourself not to torpedo your future.

The moment you know you have something to prepare for, be it an interview or an exam or a physical test, that is the moment when you start working every spare moment to nailing it. You don't stop until you've memorised every leadership principle or you know the practice questions inside out or you're hitting a 15 on the beep test consistently. The moment you drop your shoulders and utter the words 'Damn I can't do this.' is the moment defeat starts feeding off itself. The empty platitude of 'think positive' is only empty because the 'positive' is empty of advice. Positive isn't 'I can do this!' Positive is 'I'm **DOING** this!'

Back to this guy though, his response post-interview was predictable. He had now dropped the 'I'm not prepared' excuse and instead adopted 'The questions were stupid.' 'I didn't have long enough.' He had now absolved himself of responsibility for preparing for the interview, and it was the interview itself that had failed him. With this final mental leap he had solidified his excuse in failure, and the empty platitudes continued to comfort him.

Let me assure the young men who read this, if you do your part in preparing yourself to be successful you will have put yourself into a higher bracket than the average candidate. This can be applied not only to working life, but everything you aim to be a success in. If you prepare for a date by looking fresh and talking calm, you're in a higher bracket. It is all about applying yourself, and repeating the mantra of 'I am doing this.' Never shy away from defeat, because that is inviting defeat into your home. Always aim to win, and never make excuses for your success.",30,1
Your Castle,[removed],2,1
Your Castle,"An under discussed but critical piece of plate quality and longevity is your place. Where you live needs to be the foundation of your plates, and while it sounds obvious, women want to slide into a ready-man man with a good setup.

When I was younger I fought losing battles that I didn't understand at the time. Whether it was living in a fraternity house, or fresh out of college living with family, my plates would spin out quickly because her place became the launching point. Women cannot be left to be the curators of a relationship. It shifts the balance of responsibility towards her, and most women are not comfortable in that role. Even now, if I see reasons why her place has to be the HQ, such as pets that need attention, I don't expect that plate to spin for very long. The rule is this: you are the captain in every relationship, and that starts with your castle being the foundation.

As I've gotten older and upgraded living situations, I've found that I lean more and more on my house in every aspect of spinning. I'd say that 90% of my first hang outs start with her coming to my place to park, and us walking to whatever activity that is close by. Aside from the occasional trip to her place or restaurant, our nights primarily start and end here. Several of my plates I've never seen where they live, and have no interest. Your place, your friends, your interests. That is what most women want. Once I realized that, the longevity and quality of my plates exponentially improved.",2,1
The Homosexual Male,"&gt; *Why do my eyes hurt? You've never used them before.*

Women and COVID,"I've seen a few posts hit TRP in the last few months that theorise that the virus is going to change the dynamics between men and women and that you'll have to adapt to a new framework to get women to respond to you due to social distancing and fear of the virus. 

Well, I have good news for everyone. This is wrong, and heres why.

**Younger Women (20-28)**

At this stage of the pandemic it's become clear to me that younger women are responding in the same way, if not more favourably to attention and demonstrations of value. If blue pilled men were shy about approaching women and making themselves known *before* the virus, this has only been exacerbated ten fold due to social distancing. Social distancing is the new excuse men are using not to approach women. Hell, at the start I was guilty of this. I let a few cute women slip by because I didn't want to break the new norm. As the weeks went on I grew frustrated because I saw it as an excuse that worked in favour of approach anxiety, so eventually I thought 'Fuck this!' and started talking to the women I came across, and wouldn't you know it, they invited me into their 'two meter bubble' with all the excitement and vigour of a long lost friend. *They wanted me to come closer.*

Gentlemen, let me quickly say that social distancing is of course something we should be paying attention to, but if like me, you realise you're using it as an excuse, nip that shit in the bud and reap the harvest because the crops are ripe. With lockdown easing in the UK and social venues opening back up, the window of opportunity for approaching attention starved women is closing fairly quickly. Use the lessons you've picked up from the sidebar and keep applying yourself. The doomers are wrong, the virus hasn't up ended the social game and the same rules do apply.

The caveat to this is of course already knowing how to approach women and get their interest. If you meekly engage a woman from two metres away then you'll keep the virus at the forefront of her mind. 

For example, I approached a girl, early twenties, solid 7. I didn't close the social distance gap completely, but I was close enough to her that she wouldn't have been thinking about the two meter rule, but not close enough to alarm her. We spoke, I gave her some cheeky back and forth. I even clocked the ring on her finger. She told me how her husband had killed her rabbit by accident, this gave me plenty of material to work with. She found me funny, she came closer, bam, kino. The virus was at no point an issue.

This isn't even an isolated case. This first encounter sparked my interest so I started to experiment with which women would still engage.

**Older Women (28+)**

Heres the sticking point. Older women seem to hold the virus at the forefront of their minds at all times. I don't know why at this point but this is my observation. I had a pretty much guaranteed lay from an older woman lined up, then the virus happened before I could work out logistics. Now this woman will talk a big game, *constantly flirting* and coming onto me. Even now. Only, when it comes to closing, she'll *always* mention the virus. God damn. Now, I could of course be blind to simple mistakes I'm making that mean I'm not high enough value etc. but I know for a fact that her regular bit on the side isn't getting it from her either. She's frozen herself off until the social distancing ends.

Again, this isn't an isolated case. On approaching older women I've noticed they'll step back, bring up the virus and maintain the social distance. I'd be alarmed at my abilities to talk to women at this point if I wasn't receiving such a positive response from the younger women, so this has left me rather stumped. Perhaps they buy into news media narratives at a certain age, or have other concerns like if they. get infected they can't afford time off work? I'd appreciate some perspective on this from other guys in case this *is* just me.

But who really wants the older birds anyway?

**Conclusion**

So, in conclusion, anyone that is trying to peddle you a post-virus change in social dynamics is only telling an untested half truth. Women still respond in exactly the same way to someone that excites them, and at this point they haven't had that as much. Anyone who uses the virus as an excuse as to why they aren't getting women isn't applying themselves correctly. **You can still get laid!** Perhaps it could be argued that you have one new dynamic to work around, but it is possible to work around it by making them forget all about the big bad virus and keep their attention firmly on what an exciting and interesting man that has just stepped into their two meter ecosystem.",60,1
Sexual market value,[removed],0,1
Shame and Disapproval....fuck them.," Because I feel like contributing, and have a little vigour.   
 

Fuck shame.   
 

Shame. Many people have it. I dare say a large proportion of guys in Red Pill have shame triggers. You weren‚Äôt accepted properly as a kid, grew up with dysfunction, women have rejected you, you‚Äôre not ‚ÄòChad‚Äô, you struggle socially, you don‚Äôt lift yet. There could be many reasons.   
 

All these things contribute to a feeling of shame. For many, it‚Äôs a low level, low lying thing. Sometimes we‚Äôre far away from the trigger. Sometimes it smacks us right in the face.   
 

The thing about shame, and fear of disapproval is those things can stop you living an expressing your true and congruent self as an individual male.   
 

I suspect a lot of guys on ASKtrp have shame and fear of disapproval. It‚Äôs why they want to know the perfect thing to say, what to do to pass that shit test, what to say to a girl you just met. It‚Äôs why a lot of guys don‚Äôt have boundaries, or standards or ability to next.   
 

Shame can be part of a negative self-concept. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt truly want to express my real self, because I am kind of ashamed of who I am‚Äô. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to say the wrong thing here, in case she disapproves and I fuck it up‚Äô.  
 

‚ÄòI‚Äôm pissed off at this chick for being flakey, but I don‚Äôt want to assert boundaries in case I go too far and she disapproves‚Äô. ‚ÄòI‚Äôll ask the ASKtrp what to say because I don‚Äôt trust myself‚Äô. Shame. Fear of Disapproval.   
 

Fuck. All. Of. That.  
 

Shame is a hard one. You can do a lot of therapy to fix it. You can look at negative beliefs, poor inherited messages about yourself, affirmations, whatever. Sometimes you have to take action. Start following those urges, saying what you really think, pursuing what you want. Allowing yourself to be.   
 

If you‚Äôve worked your ass off to get somewhere and build some value, why would you ever have shame about who you are, what you want, what your urges are. You can work to a point where the only shame you feel is when you don‚Äôt express yourself in congruence with who you are internally.   
 

Fear of disapproval? Fuck this, too. If you‚Äôre a strong male who doesn‚Äôt take shit, has boundaries, enforces them, standards, you are going to see disapproval. Most people want something from you. Women want your validation and attention. For free if they can. If you have the strength, when needed, to say ‚Äònah baby, you kinda fucking me around, so I‚Äôma go over here where there are plenty more titties‚Äô, she‚Äôll get pissed off.   
 

The thing is, you have to ACCEPT disapproval. It is a way of the world. If EVERYBODY is happy with you there is probably something wrong, somewhere. The point is to ACCEPT disapproval. It‚Äôs like heights. You can fear heights, avoid heights, try to minimize them but guess what? Heights still exist.   
 

If a girl is fucking me around, flaking, whatever, I have no problem pulling the plug. That little old ‚Äòbeta‚Äô voice can come up; ‚Äòshe won‚Äôt like this, I should probably talk to her and explain‚Äô.   
 

That‚Äôs all horseshit. Part of being an adult male is having the ability to set boundaries, piss some people off and live with disapproval. You SHOW people how to treat you. YOU set your own price. Putting yourself first means you‚Äôll step on the toes of people who want you to put them first.   
 

So, try to work on your shame. It‚Äôs progress and not perfection, but try to prize all parts of your core masculine self. To more and more a point where the sidebar internalizes and you need less advice on what to say or do, because you‚Äôre unashamed to throw all parts of yourself out there.   
 

A good question to reflect on sometimes is ‚Äòam I acting with integrity to my value and boundaries, or am a valuing approval more‚Äô?  
 

No shame, get ok with disapproval.",18,1

A way of being,"  

Ok, motherfuckers.   
 

Innaskillz returns from the shit-posting which is TRP.RED and the calling out of questionable individuals.   
 

I don‚Äôt post much as it‚Äôs difficult to find something ‚Äònew‚Äô, when I‚Äôd rather be pushing guys to read back over old posts and blogs and dig through the good shit.   
 

But, here is something.   
 

Stop being so fucking obsessed with what to ‚Äòdo‚Äô. Here on Red Pill lots of younger guys like to be caught up in a more logical approach to behaviour.   
 

We talk about mentalities; idgaf, outcome independence, prize, frame, all that good special sauce shit.   
 

But then guys on ASKtrp are obsessed with how to DO those things. ‚ÄòWhat do I say, how should I respond, what should I text‚Äô?  
 

It read like ‚Äòhow do I DO outcome independence‚Äô? ‚ÄòHow do I DO idgaf‚Äô?  
 

The mentalities are not things that you DO, they are things which you ARE. They are your ATTITUDE on a FELT level.   
 

These things are not a way of DOING, they are a way of BEING.   
 

Women don‚Äôt really listen to what you say. They don‚Äôt think ‚Äòoh, he logically answered my shit-test with the specific words which logically indicate he has prize mentality‚Äô.  
 

Women read your way of BEING, your ATTITUDE, your FELT EMOTIONAL experience.   
 

I see a lot of guys asking what to say to pass shit tests. You can say pretty much whatever the fuck you want. How ARE and your EXPERIENCE is the important thing.   
 

A lot of here, and I know some EC‚Äôs will attest that you can say pretty much anything, even ridiculous shit.   
 

I recently fucked a very attractive Brazilian girl. She was testing me hard from the get go; ‚ÄòYou crazy, what‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äô   
 

It was actually sort of weird. A whole barrel of sassy attitude coming right at me. Now, for a second I‚Äôm taken aback. I want to show her IDGAF and am not intimidated by her.   
 

I didn‚Äôt think about what to SAY to show IDGAF. Boom, it‚Äôs my attitude. It‚Äôs a way of BEING.   
 

I answered back with some shit like ‚ÄòYou ssooo crazzzyyy man, you so fucking LOCO‚Äô. This was followed by an assortment of crazy noises and made up Portuguese‚Äô. Think ‚ÄòMamma sita, ala sita‚Äô.   
 

Not long later she says ‚ÄòI like you‚Äô.   
 

Why did she like me? It certainly wasn‚Äôt my words. It was and logical behaviour. It was my ATTITUDE. My attitude on a FELT LEVEL.   
 

If you get what I‚Äôm saying, you realise that the mentalities we speak of are experiences. They are attitudes. This means that your EXPRESSION, the words you use, etc, can be idiosyncratic. It‚Äôs important guys loosen up and find how you express yourself.   
 

Asking guys all the time ‚Äòwhat should I say here, because I want her to think I‚Äôm outcome independent‚Äô means that whatever the guy tells you will almost become a limited way to express whatever it is you‚Äôre trying to express.   
 

This is how guys become robots and script readers. They don‚Äôt FEEL on a FUNDAMENTAL ATTITUDINAL level the mentalities in their bones.

Observation that the gaming junkies will get,"**TL;DR:Be Like CD Prokekt Red/Hello Games**

Look at how CD Projekt Red is handling Cyberpunk's delays, cuts, all the stuff that hyped games have to deal with.

Look at how Hello Games had to climb up from a release so bad it changed people's view on the concept of pre-ordering.

**Abundance Mentality:**

**CDPR:** Cultivated by the reputation they have. People already know they make great games (I played witcher 3 for 10 mins, I don't think it's for me, I'm just takin ppls' word for it.)

**Agree &amp; Amplify:**

**CDPR:** That's exactly what they're doing. People troll them, they agree and amplify, and the fans are cheering them on for it.

**Stoicism:**


**Hello Games:** You already bought in. I'm going to prove it was worth it. They had a perfect stoic response to the backlash. They realized they oversold themselves, and are working HARD to prove that they are a high percentage of what they claimed to be. 

**Recap/General Thoughts:**

Other game devs have to deal with being called liars and incompetent etc over the same things that CD Projekt Red is doing, and yet here they are, triumphant, before their game comes out!

People have been scared away from the concept of preorders, and CDPR's essentially immune!

No Man's Sky's release flop transcended the initial audience. The dropping of the ball got more attention than the game got, and you know what the fallen alpha, Hello Games did? The alpha went back into monk mode, Started lifting(making their game better),Studied the territory(They still didn't release all of the features they promised, but released features people WANTED ), literally stepped up their game and when they came out of monk mode people said ""You've changed, wanna grab a drink sometime?""

I don't even think Hello Games did much marketing for their big release. People saw they got better, and word got around. They got a reputation of hard working, gained some abundance, and kept chiseling.

The hilarious thing is (I'm not much of a gamer so take my opinion with a grain of salt) :
The game's still not good. It's a micromanaging game that hides under the ""skin"" of an adventure game. It's still a hollow experience of grinding for grinding sake!

In Other words: No Man's Sky is a former fat guy with no personality, but the fact it was once fat makes it seem hotter, and more competent.

The transformation, and overcoming story is what really pushed the game into what people consider ""good""",12,1

**Origin Story**

In elementary school, I was the ring leader of the neighborhood kids. We played Soldier with toy guns everyday, and I was the leader of my team every time. Whenever all my friends were outside and I was at home, they would all run to my house and practically drag me out to come play with them. It wasn't a complete day without me around. Even the older kids respected me. This instilled into me an acclimation to being the guy everybody wanted to have on their team, the guy everybody wanted to be friends with, and the guy everybody relied on. It was a good start to life that I'm sorry many other men didn't get the chance to experience. No matter, because my advice is implementable no matter how you started off. 

My family moved when I went to middle school, so I lost all of my friends. Fortunately, one of my older brothers always seemed to know how to be ""cool"" in highschool, and I learned alot thanks to him! He started bringing over girls in the 8th grade to hang out with him, and I would run into them, talk, and end up making a new connection. Eventually I had cute girls to talk to on the bus - which bought me brownie points with the guys on the bus, and that's how my beginning friendships formed in the 6th grade.

6th And 7th grade was a typical kid experience, and 8th grade is where the fun finally began....

***

**The Start Of An Empire**

I, along with every other hip 12/13 year old, had jumped from myspace to FaceBook and created an account using a fake birth date. We would all post nonsensical kid writings, and funny pictures, until one day I realized my friends rarely commented on my stuff, and I them, so I texted one of them and said, ""Hey man, how come you never engage with my posts?"" And he replied, ""idk dude, I dont really realize it."" So I had the bright idea to propose exchanging comments/likes with each other. I then repeated the conversation with another friend. And another. Eventually I had a group of 12~ solid bros who would all like and comment on my shit. And the girls on my friends list took notice. I mentioned my idea to some of those older girls my brother brought over, who have now moved on to college, and while they weren't too keen on having random middleschoolers as friends, they quickly changed their mind when I reminded them we would soon be freshman, and I'm sure they wouldn't mind the extra attention. With the girls now involved, I had a co-ed circle of 15 people actively engaging in my comments, in addition to the randoms / acquaintances who hopped on the bandwagon. Everybody loves a winner I suppose. I theorize that if you get 1 like, that's all you'll get. But if you get 10 likes, you'll get 2 more from randoms.

This small investment in middle school would end up paying dividends in high school.

Eventually, as most suburban kids, I get invited to train Marijuana. I was reluctant at first - so I asked my older brother who smoked, and he said to try it out and see if I liked it. It was awesome! This led me to start smoking with my brother, who introduced me to his connection - Weedman Tom. 

Weedman Tom was a tall, round, glasses wearing hippy. And boy was he coool. After the 4th time meeting him, he added me on facebook, and that's when he noticed my online popularity. ""You got a lot of friends man!"" he said to me. ""Yeah, I do."" I replied. ""You know if any of them smoke weed?"" I have street smarts, and I knew where this was heading - ""They might. How about you give me some and I'll sell it to them."" - He lol'd. ""You're crazy little dude, your brother would kill me!"" - ""He doesn't have to know."" - ""Hmm. Okay. I'll give you a little bit. Go see if you can sell it."" 

He fronted me some reggie (not the best, but it'll get you high, and it's cheaper than regular kush) - I flipped it for 2x what it was worth. Weedman Tom was impressed. By this point, my friends had informed their friends of my entrance into the drug business, and I would be getting text messages from unknown numbers quite often. Every week, he would loan me a quarter, and I would keep a G for myself to enjoy, while flipping the rest, keeping a third of the profits. I was happy to be able to smoke for free, the cash was just an added bonus. This endevour continued from my middle school graduation all the way to highschool.

**Losing My Virginity**

[There was a cute red-headed German girl](https://ibb.co/TtQH5Fk) who I would see in the hallways occasionally. Boy did she have a phat ass - impressive, for a white girl. One day, the bus routes were changed, and she started riding my bus on the way home. I decide to sit next to her and introduce myself at the next stop. She quickly blurted, ""I have to pee!"" And ran off the bus to her house. Chalked it up as a loss and let it go.

The next day, she was the first one on the bus, and I was like the 5th~. I walked right past her and sat in the back where my friends normally hung out. She jumped up and plopped her big behind in the seat next to me and said, ""Hey why didn't you come say hi to me again?"" I shrugged. ""Your name was AFTSOV, right? I'm Nikki."" 

We started chatting on the bus together for about a week, until I decided to invite myself over to her house after school. ""Okay, but we have to hang out on my porch because my parents are home."" - Fine by me.

After walking down the stairs of the bus, we strolled to her front porch and sat down, where she began telling me her life story, which was pretty heavy. I did my best to keep things light and humorous to which she replied ""You don't take anything seriously do you?"" I said, ""what good is life if you can't have fun?"" She laid her back down onto her concrete porch and closed her eyes. ""I don't think I ever met a boy I could talk to like you."" With that, I leaned over her and pressed my lips onto hers. My first kiss - her lips were slightly chapped, but tasted sweet.

We made out on the bus ride home every day after that, and I introduced her to my many friends on the bus. 2 weeks after the kiss, she told me she wanted to share a secret with me, but she couldn't say it out loud. Nikki pulled out a notebook, then jotted down a message for me in pencil.

""I want to have sex with you.""

Wow! Honestly, I was happy just having a cute girl to make out with, but sex? I must have hit the lottery! I took her to my house, and my parents weren't home. They never are. I have what's known as a ""Free Crib,""  which means my parents work all day and I have the house to myself if my brother wasn't home. Fortunately he was out with his friends or some shit, and I took her on my bed, undressed her snow tinted body and went to town on her pink pleasure palace. Of course I hit it from the back cus I'm all about that ass.

**The Summer Before Freshman Year Of Highschool**

I had a girlfriend to bang, friends to hang out with, and drugs to sell. My lifelong friend had introduced me to LSD, which I instantly fell in love with. This later led to experiments with Mushrooms, DMT, and Ayahuasca. Most of which I ended up making connections with dealers, and started pushing their product for them, in exchange for free doses and cash. (Side Note: I now only enjoy Weed, LSD, and Ayahuasca. Mushrooms and DMT aren't my cup of tea.)

With all my extra money, and in an attempt to relive my Child Soldier days of old, I invested in a bunch of Airsoft Equipment to start playing. When my parents asked me where I got the money from, I said my childhood life long friend, (a very rich kid) had his dad buy them for me and him so we could play together. So I started playing Airsoft, really learning to enjoy simulated combat sports. That is, until my brother called me a faggot nerd for playing airsoft. He was a paintballer, and told me true alpha males play Paintball. I tried it out, and the I realized he wasn't lying. The bullets hurt more. The enemies were quicker, smarter, more masculine. The equipment was heavier - I felt like a real soldier - which I really loved. I sold most of my airsoft equipment and went all out with Paintball gear, and started playing with my brother, which made my parents happy.

Thanks to short-distance sprinting while carrying 10-20LB of equipment raised my cardio to insane levels. All that running also left me very lean.

By the time I first stepped into highschool, I had a huge drug supply, a decent body, and a reliable booty call.

**Tales Of Kidd Drunkadellic - Freshman Year Of Highschool**

I was nervous the first day of highschool, but it subsided as I was greeted by old friends in the main lobby. I settled into school with ease, and after a few weeks, had steady clintelle ranging from experimental freshamn to experienced upper classman, all hitting me up for some tabs or ganja. Some of my clients were girls, and they were all surprised to find out their dealer was a 14 year old kid. I remember a girl made fun of me and said, ""Awh you're so cute, you think you're a bad boy!"" I replied by saying, ""I dont know about being a bad boy but I am definetely cute."" She giggled. Didn't bang her though, so I must be a beta.

Anyways, Near October one of my upper classman friends mentioned he was going into the swim team for his second year, and I mentioned I used to love swimming when I was younger. He suggested I try out, and I did. After making the team, my cardio and speed caught the eye of both my coach and my teammates. I was eventually known as, ""that cool freshman kid, the one with the tabs and shit."" I made a group of close friends (one of many, I might add) that I stayed with throughout highschool. Sports teams have a way of easily forming bonds between men.

My reputation preceeded me. When I was switched into an AP class out of regular classes, I met several people who knew of me. They invited me into their group projects, where I became aquainted with a Junior named Bella. A beautiful Italian girl. Unfortunately for me, she wasn't into me, but I didn't hold it against her. 

She was taken aback by my calm response to her rejection, and decided she wanted to be my friend. I said sure why not. Once people knew I was hanging out with Bella, it was like jumping into a lion's den with steaks tied to your waist.

By my sophmore year, people in my grade all knew I hung out with the coolest Juniors and Seniors. This caught the attention of one of my best girlfriends, Crissy. 

A bright brown skinned carribean beauty - she was on the track team and had that banging track-star physique. [Muscular legs and a phat round ayss.](https://ibb.co/yfRf78t) Unfortuately her face wasn't the greatest, I mean, *I* thought she had a pretty face, but atleast her [smile was pearly white!](https://ibb.co/dDm0PTn) In addition to her sweet body, she was also artistically talented and was a nerd in a cute kind of way. She liked anime, video games, was emo, basically my dream girl.

We'll get back to Crissy later on, because although I had my heart set on her, I was still dating Nikki, and I had a bigger problem to deal with.

**Reputation Spreads Fast - Sophmore Year**

My birthday is in the summer, and when I turned 15 I hit a great growth spurt. I massed up from a short kid to 5'10, and started to sprout a goatee stuble. While I was prospering in terms of physicality and socialitiy one of my good friends was not. Antione is a short, scrawny, croatian kid with a thing for photography. Kids gonna be big some day. Anyways, he was getting bullied relentlessly from a group of Jocks since the start of freshman year. The ring leader, Brandon, had stolen one of Antione's camera. When he told me about this, I was pissed. 

Antione and I were hanging out one day, when he gets a text from an unfamiliar number. ""I'm gonna kick your ass when I see you.""

It had to be the bastard. I told Antione to call the number. When the voice on the otherside picked up, his first words were ""What do you want Faggot?""

I said, ""You're not gonna fight Antonie. Fight me.""

""Who is this?"" 

""This is Aftsov.""

Silence.

""I dont care who you are I'lll still beat your ass.""

We shit talked for another minute, then a date and time was set. I'm not gonna lie, this guy was intimidating. He had been lifting since he was 12 or some shit, cus he was packing muscle. I'd estimate he weighd 165 with visible abs. He was also a year older than me, and a grade higher than me. Either way, I didn't care. For one, no one fucks with my friends and family. Two, I had an ace up my sleeve. 

My dad was a professional [Brazilian Soccer Player](https://ibb.co/88FQSJY) - he played for the team ""Botafogo,"" and wanted me to follow in his footsteps. Walking by [his trophy collection](https://ibb.co/xMXsptp) is always an inspiration. Although I was good at soccer/running like he was, the sport just wasn't interesting to me. I prefered combat. That's when he told me his tales of the Rio De Jenario slums, and how he would get picked on by the older bigger kids. He signed up for Judo, and that was the end of his bullying problem. When I was 11, he signed me up for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and Ive been training on and off ever since. I'm no expert, but I've got some moves.

The day of the fight rolled around one crisp autumn afternoon. Darkness was peaking it's head on us. We met on the soccer field of the school, and a small crowd of people came to watch, including my friend Antione. I knew that bastard would bring his friends, so I brought my older brother (who was a senior now,) and he brought his friends from the wrestling team. No jumping was happening that night.

The fight started. He swung first and missed. After missing he tried to grab me, which put his head under my pec. [I instinctivly put him in a guiottene.(https://ibb.co/c80cZ6w) I tried to pull him into guard, but he was too strong to pull him down. Instead, he lifted me up and slammed me. Thankfully I have good fighting instincts, and I rolled my head as forward as I could, to avoid getting slammed on my head. After the slam, he couldnt get back up, so I leaned back and wrapped my feet around his back. After a few seconds of tight squeeze, he started tapping. I heard someone say, ""Alright, AFTSOV is the man."" I looked to Antione, and he said to let him go, so I did.

Immediately after letting go, he got up and started punching me in the face. [That fucker clocked me GOOD.](https://ibb.co/rmctGLX) I grabbed him and pulled him down, we rolled around a little and I ended up on his back, and he ended up the victim of my rear naked choke. Needless to say, I didn't make the mistake of mercy twice. I let him go limp in my chokehold. Then I kept choking. I stood up and he was a log, so I slapped him in the face just to say fuck you. I walked home with my brother and friends while he regained consciousness.

People talked about the fight and shared the video (Which I unfortunately cannot find) around, and more importantly, those guys stopped fucking with Antione.

Eventually, the video was deleted because Brandon died in an accident, but I still had that picture saved.

By now, I had quite a few girls striking up conversations, bringing up that video. One of those girls was Crissy.

I was chilling in our School's breakroom, a place for students to hang out after class, chill out, and play video games. She walked in, and by coincidence was a friend of my friend. They talked to each other while I focused on the game, until she sat down on the couch and said, ""hey whatcha playing?""

I said, ""This is halo.""

""Oh yeah! That game is so cool but I'm not any good at it.""

""Double kill - T-t-t-triple kill!""

""Wow, you're pretty good actually,"" she said.

""yeah haha.""

Our mutual friend said he had to leave, and so I expected to be alone in the break room, but Crissy broke my expecations when she stayed and continued to chat with me.

We exchanged numbers, she brought up the fight, I sent her the video, and she eventually led the conversation to an erotic fan-fiction of us fucking. Boy, did that girl have an imagination.

Crissy and I shared a few sexts until one day she wound up in my room [with my cock magically in her mouth.](https://ibb.co/CP39sgb) We dated for 3 years after our her fellatio initiation.

***

**Becoming A Man Whore**

I am a Man-Whore‚Ñ¢ = I admit it. 100% Certified jiggalo. I have no loyalty to these hoes and stick my dick into the one with the best body. Sorry to all the hearts I've broken. I really am. I hate seeing a girl cry!

I was still dating Nikki, however, (I feel like an asshole for saying this,) I had gotten bored of her and already cheated on her with Crissy. To make things easier on her, I told her I wanted to open the relationship. She agreed without much conflict.

Enter Johanna.

Johanna was a super short and nerdy white girl. She read books and shit. While she didnt have an ass like Nikki's, she made up for it with a pretty face. We shared science class together and happened to share the lab table. Oh, and did I mention she was Nikki's best friend? 

I got her number on a whim and would phone chat with her from time-to-time. One day I popped the big question, ""Hey Jojo, you wanna be like, my fuck buddy?""

""Your fuck buddy? Really?""

""Yea.""

""But what about Nikki?""

""She said it's okay.""

""Oh, I mean, yeah! I would!"" 

After that phone call I brought a tent to school, and kept it stowed in my backpack. During class, I was feeling up her leg and some people noticed I was putting moves on her. Eventually kids in the class started commenting about the sexual tension between us. I felt a little embarrassed at first, but then let it go as I realized ""screw you guys, I'm getting laid!""

After school I walked with Johanna to the woods behind the campus, set up my tent, and boned her with pleasure. 

A few days later, Nikki had found out.

""You fucked JoJo? How could you!?""

""I said I wanted to open the relationship baby.""

""Yeah but you fucked my best friend!""

""I'm sorry I guess.""

""Are you still gonna see her?""

""Yes.""

There was a moment of silence. She broke it by saying ""Are you still going to see me?""

""I still like you, so if you wanna keep dating we can.""

She gently interlaced her fingers with mine and we cuddled the rest of the bus ride home.

Throughout Sophomore year, I was banging Jojo, Nikki, and Crissy regularly, the former 2 following me around school and causing girls to wonder, ""why the fuck does this guy have chicks following him around everywhere?"" Couple that with knowing half the upper classman, I had god-like social proof and status. Eventually it paid off as I was invited to my first house party, hosted by a Senior buddy of mine, Jason. 

I came over with some weed and rolled us a few blunts. One of their parents had bought us some liquor so we started downing shots too. The music came on, and everybody started dancing. One bro who I didnt know started grinding on an Asian girl. Then, in a spur of the moment decision, a drunk senior girl suddenly shouts, ""Come here AFTSOV, you sexy mother fucker!"" And we started making out. It was then I decided that I like parties.

***

**Junior Year - Enter The Dark Days**

After turning 16 and earning my learners permit, I had purchased an old 90' Toyota Corolla for 1,000 cash. My parents bought it for me as a present, but I paid it back to them slowly, so they wouldn't know it was drug money I was giving them. I was happy to have my car, but I still thought about that vodka from Jason's party. Like a light switch, my mind snapped on with a simple yet brilliant plan.

Over summer break, I hit another growth spurt - I was now 6 feet tall, with a full goatee. I was one of the most mature looking people in my inner friend circle, besides the upper classman. I decided to use that to my advantage

I hopped onto the internet and found a reliable overseas fake ID vendor - I bought one and tested it out at my local liquor store, and the shit actually worked. I couldn't believe it actually worked. I phoned up the senior I made out with at Jason's party and told her we should go drinking together. She asked me, ""okay, do you know who has alcohol?"" I said, ""I'll just buy some."" She said ""How???"" And i said I'll pick you up and show you.

I scooped her in my corolla, which was impressive as she herself was car-less. Then I drove her to liquor store and bought some cheap Skol. When I dropped it in her lap, I felt desire through her eyes. I'm sure you know what happened next.

Man, I was living life. This might all sound like a big brag to you, but I seriously hope you can take at least one piece of useful advice from this story. Anyways, I was fucking and stacking cash. I knew the Coke dealers, the ecstasy dealers, and I took advantage of my vast social network. Eventually I had the bright idea to buy a bullet proof vest and an assault rifle. 

Using my newly made ID, I contacted a private vendor and arranged a meetup. In a random decision, I messaged a [hot black single in my area](https://ibb.co/zQ7VDDC) and told her to [come on the adventure of a lifetime.](https://ibb.co/sWZqJX3)  In case you haven't realized already, I *really* love black girls.This particular queen gave me her number and I picked her up. I bought my first AK 47, which I later sold to my brother. As for the hot black single, [she wound up tied on my bed with her ass sticking out.](https://ibb.co/3zsfCf1)

Word got around and soon people from ""the wrong crowd"" started hitting me up for weapons and shit. I called this chapter the dark days because I started getting involved with some sketchy shit, and some of my homies caught felonies for that shit. Shout out to Lil' Brick and Finito. They kept it real - I still send those guys commissary money so they dont starve, cus those boys are gonna be gone for a long time. 

Anyways, when they first got locked up and I sent them those first commissary deposits, they quickly told their sister / cousin respectively, who both attended my school, which only boosted my reputation as a good guy who cared for his friends.

It's also called the dark days because of the drama between my bitches. It wasn't all orgies and orgasms. Crissy and Nikki fought all the time, playing manipulative mind games with each other to try to get each other to stop seeing me. It escalated to the point where Nikki thought up a fake rape accusation about me - no one believed her of course, not even the teachers / administration. Her reckless endangerment of my life is what caused me to ultimately break up with her. She started pulling her hair out and got really fat. I feel bad for her cus she was nice until she went crazy. I'm sure Crissy was glad that happened, lol.

**Junior Year Part II - Piano Man**

While skipping class with one of my buddies we decided to try walking into the auditorium. I expected it to be unlocked, so I decided to jokingly throw myself into the door. What ended up happening is I slammed into the door, sent it flying open, and face planted onto the floor of the now open walk-way. After dusting my self off and telling my boy to shut the fuck up, we both realized the impossible - We could sneak into the auditorium! We explored the auditorium and made our way up towards the stage, where I made a life changing discovery - a grand piano, sitting right on the stage, hidden behind the curtains. I was fascinated. The white/black keys entranced me into playing them. After hearing the wonderful noise it produced, I was hooked. From then on, I dedicated myself to learning the piano.

Every lunch I would go to the piano, pull up a song on my phone, and teach myself how to play. Once I got good enough I started inviting my bros to come listen. They told me it was sick. Next came the girls. I told Bella to come take a listen and she was impressed. The next time I played she brought her a new friend. That girl brought another friend. Eventually I had a small group of girls to serenade. They would take videos of me and show their friends, which led to an Asian chick named Amanda to come and listen to me play. Coincidentally, she knew how to play too! She was classically trained since she was 5 (typical asians), and showed me things I was doing wrong. The one tip I never forgot was fixing my hand posture. I played with straight fingers when you should really have them curved. Eventually I banged Amanda in the auditorium when it was just her and I there. The drama club had their stage props there, which included a couch, how lucky for me huh? Straight out of a casting couch scene, forreal.

**Senior Year - Kidd Drunkadellic Strikes Back**

I have always been a writer - I scored a perfect 600 on my writing SOL, which was a 6 page essay, and had a score of 7 on my writing SAT when the time came to take it. Besides that, I've been fiddling with fictional stories, poetry, and raps. Crissy loved listening to me rap and recite poetry, to the point where she suggested I start performing. And I was glad I fucking did.

I started off with some kind of Oratorical competiton, we basically had to give a speech on whatever topic we decided on. [I was a finalist.](https://ibb.co/Hhk6x1f) My name was on the morning announcements for like 5 days straight, my english teacher/coach was telling everyone about my speech - there was nobody who didn't know who I was.

There was a talent show going on at my school. It was called the ""Mister &amp; Misses XYZ School name Talent Competition."" I deiced I was going to win by spitting some of my bars to the audience. There were 25 other competitors, a mixture of boys and girls. I rapped, then 10 minutes later was crowned Mister XYZ alongside my Queen, a very hot black girl (im like a maganet to them haha). Unfortuntely I lost the picture of me in my crown so you wont be seeing that one :(

On the bright side, being crowned king of my school gave me the confidence to start seeking out other opportunities to perform. I eventually got in contact with a moderately sized Rap Battle League. After sending the managers some of my lyrics, [he invited me to perform.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwnr20qolWU) I have an offical rap battle record of 2 wins, 1 loss at the moment. 

Bella watched me peform at that battle, and she was eager to show her friends my lyrical carnage. This caught the attention of 1 spanish girl and 2 black girls. It all came together at prom.

**Senior Year Part II - The Story Ends, But the Legend Begins**

By the time prom rolled around, I had homies get killed, other homies turn rat/snake, and got heartbroken / cheated on by a girl I loved. Life is bitter sweet. 

I decided when the time came, I was gonna let go of all my troubles, even if it was just for an hour. I drank some vodka with my friend at my crib then had my mom drive us to prom. It was populated by the time we arrived, and I schmoozed my way around the crowd. Eventually I came across and arguing couple. I knew the guy of the couple, an acquiantance named Randy. One time, he was dozing off in class and the teacher yelled at him. Randy lied and said he was reading, to which the teacher said, ""what page are we on."" I whispered ""24"" to him, and he repeated it out loud. The whole classroom burst into laughter because there was only 2 pages. Haha good times.

Anyways, Randy didn't want to slow dance with his girlfriend Amy. I knew the chick and she knew me, and I knew for a fact she had a crush on me. I took the opportunity to make them both happy and dance with his girl. We slow danced, she commented on my vodka breathe, and I laughed. Some other girls saw I was dancing with a decently pretty girl, and took note.

Here's where the fun starts. They start playing some typical upbeat dance shit and I find a hot teacher I always wanted to bone. I tell her to dance with me and she keeps shit-testing me until I finally say, ""hey if you wanna have fun you gotta dance with me,"" or some shit, and she decides ""oh what the heck."" I took her by the hand and led her to the center of the dance floor, and I started putting RSD moves on her - Spinning her around, lifting her up in the air, and finally dipping her by her back so she arched backwards. After that one she came up and said ""Oh we shouldn't be doing this AFTSOV!"" I said ""why not it's fun and you're pretty tonight,"" and she kissed me on my cheek. I heard several people go, ""OOOO"" and she laughed and hustled away in her heels.

One of my old friends, (who no longer speaks to me, sadly) came up to congratulate me. I said ""The fun's not over buddy, follow my lead."" (I dont know the name of this dance, so if someone has a video of it please link it so I can hyperlink it, thanks!) 

My buddy and I locked elbows, then began skipping on beat in a circle. After a few seconds, a huge circle formed around us. Everybody at prom was watching, clapping, and cheering for us. When we unlocked elbows [we just busted out into retardly fun freeform dancing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC-0wdTT) After a minute of this, a hot black girl, one of the ones who was interested in me because of my hip hop accolades, ran up and started twerking her phat ayss on me. Instant boner. 

As the night was coming to a close, she brought over her cousin to take a picture with me. [I'll let you guess which one of them I fucked.](https://ibb.co/8sz974X)

I didn't win prom king - didnt even run for it, but I had the time of my life.

***

**College - The Winter Articles**

My freshman year in college was almost a repeat of highschool. I immediately joined the student council, met the right people, and started / joined a few clubs. 

What I was studying doesnt matter, because I dont believe in college being the pathway to success - I see school as an opportunity to network and meet people.

There was a Coffee House spoken word poetry recital, and I of course performed an original poem. I received loud cheers, applause, and a standing ovation.

Unfortunately, my douche bag ""friend"" didnt record my accomplishment, so I cant show you that one. I never forgave him for that.

Two important phrases were spoken to me that night.

- ""Aight AFTSOV, you offically Black now.""

- ""Bro, you could have any girl you want in this room right now.""

I chose a hot girl who ended up being a fashion week runway model. We fucked a few times and went our separate ways, but I'll always have the bragging rights of having fucked a real life fashion model! Hahah.

Word got around that I fucked this model chick, and my social media was still super strong (im talking 100+ likes and 20+ comments on profile photo updates) and I start getting private messages from several different women I found attractive. 2 became friends with benefits, and 1 became a long term relationship. Was a white girl, asian girl, and a black girl. More heartache, but i have no regrets - just memories. 

***

**Epilouge - Closing Thoughts**

Well boys, I hope you took something out of my self jerk today/tonight. If I could tell you one thing, is find a passion and excel at it. Like Vasily always says, ""be good at something, no make it 2 somethings."" Show off your talents.

Also, don't be afraid to be a man of your own rules. Matter of fact, fuck the rules. You think i'd be where I was if I wasn't a crazy, fun loving mothafucka? I enjoy new experiences, I love performing, and I love danger. But that's just me. Figure out where you fall in life as a man and be the best *you* that you can be.

Also, my life wasn't all peaches and cream either. I had a LOT of fuck ups along the way. I didn't mention any of the bad times, because who want's to read that? The world is filled with negative shit so let me share something positive for a change.

Anyways...

I got my ass kicked.

I got robbed.

I was betrayed by friends.

I got my heart broken.

I fucked up with countless women who were guaranteed lays.

But, as they say, ""shit, life goes on nigga.""

Peace.

***

**Young Sexy Man: The Breakdown.**

*Things that make you attractive in highschool and College* 

^from ^my ^personal ^experience ^and ^observations

- **Competing in a sport** I had friends on the Football team, the Lacross team, and the Soccer team. Every single one of them had at least 1 girl friend, if not a fuckbuddy or two. As I mentioned, I was on the swim team, and played paintball on the side. Being on a highscool sports team is an instant elevation of status.

- **Winning a Fight** As I said earlier, I was a noivce in MMA, (BJJ &amp; JKD), but a few months of training will put you leagues ahead of the average ""street fighter"" especially when you're in your teens/early 20's. Winning that fight my freshman year solidified my reputation as a guy who stands up for his friends, and how the young kids put it, ""a whiteboy that got hands, doe.""

- *Selling Drugs** Note, you can't just be a guy that *knows how to get drugs.* You have to be the guy who *sells* the drugs to score the bad-boy outlaw points with the ladies.

- **Illegal Shit In General** Let's just say I've seen the inside of courtrooms - but that whole ""Fake ID to get alcohol"" idea of mine made me the first guy invited to any ""cool kid"" parties.

- **Know who throws the parties, or throw them yourselves.** I've only thrown one party with my buddy in highschool, but I've been invted to dozens, and people in my outer social circle would usually ask me when the next party was, and if I could invite them.

- **Have An Open Crib** Open crib basically means that you have your whole house to yourself. My parents worked from when school ended, all the way to like 12 midnight. I wouldn't host parties although I had the opportunity to, however I did have fun little co-ed chill-sessions at my house a few times a month, which opened the door to meeting friends of friends, cute girls who knew cute girls... you get the idea. Young people like hanging out in a house without parents around poking their nose into things. It makes them feel more mature. Double points if it's actually your own place.

- **Have a Driveable car.** While you might get points with your bros for having an out of commission mustang that you and your pops work on in the garage, the ladies only care if you got a car that DRIVES. The whip can be anything, I got pussy using my 1990 Corolla.

- **Be an impressive musician/artist.** I was cursed with shitty drawing skills, unlike my friend who was commissoned to paint a mural on the schools lobby wall, and was king of art-club sexcapades. To equalize my curse with a blessing, God gave me the talents of piano, performance, and poetry. I call that trio, the Big PPPs. I was playing piano after class with friends hanging out, I was performing on stage in rap venues and battles, and I was receiving standing ovations for my poetry recitals. All of those factors contributed to my insane status, and drew the attention of the hottest girls in school.

- **Have A Booming Social Media Profile.** Cultivating a cool FaceBook is easy - and while I don't post much on Social Media anymore, I still reap the benefits of huge like/comment ratios on my old posts and photos. Get some of your close friends (guys and girls,) like and comment on eachother's shit, and it will grow organically. Or you can go the Dark Triad route and create fake profiles, kinda like how Frank Sinatra hired a fake entourage to make people think he was famous. Fake it until you make it if you have to.

- **Have Multiple Friend Groups, Be Dynamic With Your Friendships.** - You dont have to limit yourself to one clique. I was friends with jocks, with skaters, with druggies, with dealers, with nerds, with chior/theatre kids, with gamers, and banging girls from all the cliques. Knowing the top guys in the clique is an easy ""in"" to get the ladies.

- **Hang Around Attractive Women** - This one is obvious. An unfortunate truth in life, is that *not every woman will find you attractive.* It's the way the cookie crumbles for us normal dudes, but that's okay! I befriend a hot girl, who introduced me to other hot girls, which led to me being hugged by girls whenever I walked in the halls or into a class with one of them. I even had a pair of decently cute girls who would follow me to my classes, and purposely ""go to the bathroom"" just to sneak over to my classroom and blow kisses at me. I fucked both of them. Of course, other girls took notice, and word spread. ""AFTSOV got 2 girlfriends."" - ""Yeah I know they always following him everywhere, how can you date 2 girls at the same time AFTSOV?"" - ""Ha, those are the 2 you know about.""

- **Having Balls.** - I've encountered many sheepish men, and let's just say they weren't spreading wet lips like my friends and I. I've gotten girls literally by just going up to them and saying, ""You're cute, wanna be my girlfriend?""

- **Having Bros who Vouch For you.** I earned a reputation as a loyal friend, and my bros would constantly speak good about me to their friends and girlfriends. Positive reputation goes a long way.

- **Joining a Cool Club, or Starting Your Own Cool Club** In college, I was a member of the psychology club (great place to meet highly empathetic and intelligent young ladies to bone.) I also started a Rap / HipHop club, and an MMA club. In addition to those, I made friends with the ultimate frizbee dudes and hung out with them sometimes. Clubs give you ease of access to new male friends and prospective love interests. When I first started my rap club, I passed out flies and had 20~ of my friends show up just to support me. It was a great time.

- **When Dances like prom come around, take your friends and control the stage. Be a social maniac at prom.** When I arrived at prom after sipping on the vodka, I was ready to get my groove on. I couldn't dance but I didn't care, I just wanted to have a good time. I stole a girl from her dude, then my friend and I did that cowboy ""elbow in elbow"" square dance in a circle thing, everyone formed a circle around us and started teaching. I used and old RSD Jullian club dance routine on a hot teacher, then I had a cute little black girl with a phat ayss come and start twerking on me while everybody watched. I got laid that night, needless to say. 


- **Have an Adventerous/Curious Spirit &amp; Be Willing To Try New Things** Often I would call up friends and go on walks with them and just see where the day would take us. The time I'll never forget is where me and 3 friends challanged some random hispanic guys to a game of soccer, where my dad's genes in me kicked in, and I scored an amazing first goal. Having fun is a people maganet, and remember, woman are people too! 

- **Have Loving And Supportive Parents** - A sad reality of modern life in America is lack of a masculine father figure, and an overbearing feminine presence. This results in fucked up children. I was a fortunate soul who had a father that guided me in the way of men, and a mother who let me have my freedom to experiment in life.",28,1
Another quick reminder on how fucking dangerous even the cutest bitches can be.,"Couple years ago I met P, who's one of my closest friends now. P is a man's man. Grew up in a house with no father, worked his ass off since he was 15, now is one of the top Men's Physique competitors in our country and, generally speaking, is a great laid-back guy with a rock solid frame and 99 lvl of IDGAF attitude who's always there for his friends. 

In january this year he met Sally after she DM'd him a couple of times. Sally is a petite blonde with a great ass, huge blue eyes and a goofy personality. She seemed alright when I first met her: she didn't drink, had no tattoos, piercings, was a gym rat and was pretty shy.

They hit it off pretty well but note that he never mentioned them being official and even despite him dodging the ""what are we"" bullet a couple of times, Sally sure as hell thought they're gonna marry one day. Mister P at the time had a couple of ONS/plates to spin and wasn't really paying too much attention to what's going on between them, so things went downhill one day.

It all started with weird things like her driving to his home to see if his car is there when he didn't answer her message at night or actually sending her girl friends to check places where him and I used to hang out a lot to see if there are women with us.

Brothers, that bitch was all over him. She looked fine af yet he was a couple points above her SMV so she was going crazy. Sally even asked him if she can eat his ass if she'd quit smoking for one month and went batshit crazy when he didn't let her do that eventually.

Shitstorm got stronger every day so mister P decided to end it all. He drove to her place and had a conversation about how things aren't working and it's time to part ways. This is when things got real serious. She started yelling, crying, threatening him that she'll kill herself, you get the drift. Bitch did a 180 in one second. Now she's posting stories with his photos about how much of a twat he is.

So, remember that one innocent blue-eyed girl who was willing to quit years of smoking just to taste raw man's ass? Well, that crazy bitch burned my man's car tonight. He's crushed, I'm speechless, she's arrested. Never let your guard down brothers.",244,1

"TRP as a 30 year old: The honest to god reason behind why ""you are enough"" is true","Forget for a second that we're in TRP. Fuck the terminology and the jargon and the theory.


For the moment, just view yourself as if you were a well adjusted normal human being who never even read about TRP. 


If you were to embody that, how absurd does it become that a woman who barely even knows you, is willing to pass judgement on your entire value as a man based off a single mistake from texting or simply 6 pictures off tinder??


How patently stupid is it, that you could have hypothetically done more in your life as a man than the guy who's only aspiration was dealing drugs, and that some how 70%+ of girls from tinder will find THE OTHER GUY as inherently more valuable??


how brain dead do you have to be as a human being to lose interest IN A HIGH VALUE GUY simply for the fact that that man has chosen to express his romantic feelings for her?


*Think about that. Realllly let that sink in. Because the more you think about it, the more you realize something is really fucking wrong.*


And then think about the **bare minimum** it takes to be a decent well adjusted human being and how many women miss that mark by a fucking mile.


==================================================


In reality - ""You are enough"" doesn't count if you're in the anger phase. It doesn't count if you're a trash person doing shitty things to others. 


=================================================


It matters when you're trying your best to just BE a decent human being. Because regardless of whatever cards you were dealt, if you are putting in honest work to better yourself and the ones you care about in life - then fuck it. you ARE enough. 


================================================


Again - you could have fuck all because life gave you an atrociously fucked up upbringing but so long as you told yourself ""nah fuck this, Im gonna be a decent human being cause fuck the cards i was given"" then you are absolutely 100% enough. 


You dont owe anyone anything. You don't owe that random pretty girl on tinder an explanation of how you're high value. You don't owe anyone an explanation about shit.


You are positively enough.",13,1
"White Women Have Broken Me Down, Black Men have helped me rebuild. Black Male Thought Matters.","[Inspired by this interview with Vin Armani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5696&amp;v=mzSZmnkl9_c&amp;feature=emb_logo)


If this place did not exist, I don't know how I would've survived.  Anthony Bourdain's position seems totally reasonable to me.  ""I have to deal with this shit again? For how long?  Fuck that. I'm out.""
I didn't even have the words to articulate what was happening to me.  My ex was willing to talk if I wanted to, but what good is a phone call if I'm unable to speak? I did literally everything perfectly, right? What's there to talk about?


The reason we use the red pill metaphor is because it's so literal for our experiences.  The dramatic change in viewpoint.


The symbolism in that movie is particularly important.  And Morpheus is the person who helps free Neo.  Who gives him the language to describe what is happening.  Who helps Neo understand the construct.  Morpheus is also black.


Black men of course are hyper sensitive to the psychological power games around us in the United States.  You have to be ""on guard"" all the time in case of a threat.  You never know who might be out to get you.


Black men have also contributed greatly to the Manosphere. Some have suggested Black men are naturally red pilled.


Right now there is slightly more deadly cold in the United States.  In particular, it attacks the already unhealthy.  You would think they would want to start a national fitness program.  Help educate America on nutrition.
Instead they do the opposite.  They close the gyms.  Lock you inside.


Unsurprisingly, the people are angry. There are riots in the streets.  Americans are tearing down monuments.  Trying to change our history. 


The protesters?  They don't even seem to have any demands.  Portland, with a bunch of liberal white dudes, is rioting for seemingly no reason.  They are angry. Angry about what?  There doesn't even seem to be a cohesive message.


One message has gotten through this June and July.  ""Black Lives Matter.""


And the reason for this, is because black thoughts matter. ""PC Culture"" aka White American Culture has become so sanitized we have stopped having words to describe the powerless situations we find ourselves in.  Female approval is why we muzzled ourselves.


There is a history that lead us to this point.  Our goal is to not make the same mistakes of our past, to not make the same mistakes as our fathers.  We have to acknowledge the sins of our father. The ones that were passed along to us.  How can we make things right. [We no longer sit in the shade of the trees from our father.](https://theredarchive.com/post/34011)


One thing is for sure, we're never going ""back to the way things were.""  We're inventing a new world together.  We have to choose what it is going to look like.


Not everyone is going to make it. This next economic collapse is going to be epic. How should be navigate these waters? Make appropriate investments of our money and time?  Help handle the women in our lives who are losing their minds?


I'll be listening to black male voices specifically as I make my bets.

Melted the Everest,"  

Almost a month ago, I accomplished the impossible 

It all started with a meeting on tinder. I was in town for 4 days. My friends and I were getting ready for a good evening, I just wanted fun, no expectation. I downloaded Tinder for the occasion precisely, and there‚Äôs one lady ( let‚Äôs call her M ), pretty, texted me, was 7-8 on photo. It didn‚Äôt take more than three sentences and she was asking me for my snapchat. We continued to communicate through this application, she quickly told me that she was going out in town tonight with a dozen girly friends to celebrate her birthday, I answered let‚Äôs meet, we going out too ! Everything was fine until she asked me: how tall are you. I have some experience with this kind of situation, because I am not the tallest with my 5'8. Besides, I also know that the game is over on tinder when she asks you for your height and that you have nothing but pictures and futile sentences to give her to show her that you‚Äôre not that bad and height don‚Äôt mean much in bed. So I didn‚Äôt have much hope when she told me she was 6'', I should have known.

Lady M seemed disappointed at the time: that‚Äôs sad, you were really cute, I‚Äôll try to match you with my friends, have you taller friend?

Me:  Yes, but not as handsome

And that‚Äôs when I felt like I got something, she said: cocky guy I like that.

In my head I had already moved on to hunt other girls, it didn‚Äôt matter to me even if she remained attractive. I knew the odds were slim.

In short, we went out to dinner with the guys, and we went around the bars afterwards, chilling with some girls, until they closed at 1 AM because of the COVID.

And it‚Äôs around this time that M texted me: I make an after party to my apartment, bring everyone you want!

So me and my friends, even people from the bars came with us, I had gained some notoriety by directing people to the after party. So, me and a friend take the front of the troop, direction apartment of M, very important thing that I‚Äôm first to show there to demonstrate who leads.

Arrived at the long-awaited place and‚Ä¶ Jesus, I would never have thought that, there were 12 girls of 6'' +, all cheerful volleyball players, I looked like a camp child day among them, but whatever, I was there to make fun first. So the evening goes on and on, but the people of the bars and my friends don‚Äôt like the atmosphere that the giant girls gave, so they leave after 30 minutes. Only a friend and I remained with the volleyball team. Funny, I managed to isolate M on his balcony and blah, blah, I kiss her, and it was good. This girl was always insulting me about my height all night long, which had no effect on my mood, quite accustomed. Finally, for a girl who wanted nothing, because of my height, I ended up fucking, she said to me: for a little one, you slay.

**I believe, that confidence, self-assurance and some cockiness is everything‚Äôs, she even said to me, all the 6‚Äô‚Äô guys that I meet have no drive, no social skill, and zero confidence.**

The next day was the last day I was in town, so she came to my house, and I repeat the same thing, bang her hard.

I have a 5‚Äô‚Äô10 plate right now and I don‚Äôt have too much problem, but 6‚Äô‚Äô, lord, it looks like everything is different, to kiss her I have to climb on something, or she has to crouch, when we are side by side standing she a head taller than me, in bed sometimes i need to do some gymnastic, it makes the thing weird. I would like some advice and suggestions,  this is a first for me, I will probably not see M again for a good month. I want to plate this girl.

Women in TRP,"I've been noticing an increase in the amount of women that are posting advice or responding to comments on TRP and AskTRP.

While I don't necessarily think that women being aware of hypergamy or other aspects of TRP is a bad thing, I do find it interesting that they are giving relationship advice here. Advice that can confuse newbies and conflicts with information in the side bar. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that sometimes things can't be helped. When the Incel subs were closed off, we started to get an influx of nihilistic posters that refuse to accept self improvement and accountability and instead believe that it boils down to only genetics.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm noticing a trend of female posters that chime in with comments like "" I love a gentleman and I‚Äôd still respect him and follow his lead"" or "" If you make me feel unclear its because Im clear, you're not for me. "" Not even sure what spurred this on.

I love a good laugh and the idea of a woman on TRP giving advice on how to have a stable relationship is  pretty fucking hilarious, but if I was new and impressionable I can see how that can be harmful.

&amp;#x200B;

Any new guys joining TRP, please, please be skeptical of advice that contradicts the side bar. Make sure that you don't blindly accept advice on the forum as gospel truth and for the love of all that is good, try it yourself. If you see veterans in the community give advice that sounds fishy, try it! See how it works. 

&amp;#x200B;

You'll be amazed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if there's a female reader that has her feathers ruffled...

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't care. I'm not here to debate you. I am not interested in hearing about how YOUR an exception or what you FEEL about what I said. 

I'm sure that you have a lot of wisdom that you're itching to share and let guys know about. I'm sure you're an amazing person, but that's not really important. This isn't about you. It's about the community.

Guys come to TRP to learn how to better themselves from other guys that have been through the ropes. We inspire each other to excel in adversity, that to various degrees, we have all experienced. 

You don't know what it's like to be divorced rape.

You don't know what it's like to be convicted before the trial.

You don't know the pressures and expectations of being a man.

You don't know even know what it feels like to be kicked in the balls.

&amp;#x200B;

At least incels do experience the world through male eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

So the next time you feel the need to answer a question or provide feedback on what YOU THINK works, how YOU FEEL and about how you're an EXCEPTION...just STOP. Take a moment to think about WHY this place exists. Ask yourself WHY are you here. Ask yourself WHAT are you doing here. Ask yourself WHY are you doing it and then circle back to WHY this place exists. 

If you can't do that honestly then don't post.  

By posting you'll just be doing more harm and wasting your time.

Women Will Only Be Attracted For A Brief Window: Strike While The Iron Is Hot,"&amp;#x200B;

If you've been working on yourself by going to the gym and working on your frame, chances are, women from your day to day life have already started approaching you to start conversations or dropping some indicators of attraction your way.

I see this over and over again to my friends and it is frustrating beyond belief when guys fail to capitalize on opportunities.

I used to make the same mistake. When I was first starting out, I remember at a Meetup group, there was a cute girl who approached me after the event and had a conversation with me. I simply talked and talked, without ever asking her out or even getting her number. But I couldn't get my mind off of the girl! I thought about her after the meetup, super excited for the next time I would see her! And of course, I didn't want to rush things, I wanted to ""play it slow...""

Well, after talking to her 2 more times after Meetups (both times without asking her out or even getting contact info), she stopped coming my way. That's when I made a fatal mistake of chasing... That's right, I approached her and tried to ""warm her up"" again. Big mistake. Now, she was cold, indifferent, just professional workplace vibes, not flirty.

This probably happens to you all the time as a beginner as well - especially if you're in High School or College. Meet a cute girl in your class, have an interesting conversation with her. Can't wait to see her again the next class! But don't get too aggressive! Let's play it nice and slow, since I feel a real connection with this girl!

Next class rolls around, same thing! Have interesting conversation! Dream about her... Still no escalation on your part... And poof, the attraction that was there initially is gone. Vanished into thin air... She goes cold and you desperately try to reignite that spark but it's over.

**Why do women lose attraction so rapidly if you move too slow?**

* Playing it slow communicates to the girl that you're afraid to lose her... and nothing is more unattractive than a guy who doesn't even believe in himself and his own value
* Playing it slow communicates that you won't know what to do on dates or in bed. It show inexperience as well as lack of leadership, and it shows her that most likely she will have to do all the work - which is not sexy at all.
* Women get hit on a lot by other guys. Chances are, at least one of those guys isn't afraid of the girl (unlike you) and they move FAST. Women have a lot of options (if they are young and hot). Most don't have the patience to wait more than a week for you to make up your mind. Too many other guys hitting her up.

**Here's what you do instead:**

* **If a girl approaches you** in any setting that doesn't involve getting a work related assignment done, that's as much of an indicator of attraction as you can possibly hope for. I swear, some guys are so inexperienced that unless the girl starts making out with them right away, they still don't know if the girl is attracted or not... Don't be one of those guys. If the girl walks up to you and strikes up a conversation, you can safely assume she is attracted. Always, Always, Always ask her out after the conversation ends. Do not play it slow
* **If a girl simply moves away from her original location and stands near you**, this is often a sign of attraction. A lot of girls are too shy to directly approach men. But that doesn't mean they're not attracted. You'll often find these shy girls hovering near you. The telltale sign of attraction is if their feet are pointed towards you, since that's subconscious. If that's the case, approach! Even a simple, ""Hi, my name is (blank), nice to meet you! What brings you here?"" will work since she is already attracted
* **If a girl smiles at you when the two of you make eye contact**, you definitely need to approach. Another blatant invitation to approach that a lot of guys fail to take advantage of. If a girl smiles at you, it's practically her way of saying, ""You're hot, come talk to me, I want to know more about you and see what you're really about!"" Again, even the simplest of openers will work since she is already attracted.
* **There are other indicators of attraction that are less reliable such as a girl looking down when you meet her eyes, or a girl playing with her hair when you walk next to her**. In my opinion, you should always play aggressively and approach any woman that even gives the slightest hint of attraction. There's nothing to lose.

The next time you find yourself seeing these blatant signs of attraction and hesitating, realize that you don't have weeks to let the attraction ""slowly build up"". You have a very brief window. If you watch the NFL, defenses don't usually allow for crazy big plays to happen. There's only the tiniest of windows for the quarterback to make a play. If you play video games, a lot of hard bosses are invulnerable as they're attacking you and only offer a brief moment (usually indicated by a color change or something) where they are vulnerable to attack. DO NOT MISS THESE WINDOWS WITH GIRLS!

**Hesitation is the seed of defeat.**

The Lifestyles of TRP,"If you just got Red-pilled, essentially you have a new way of viewing human-relations.

This is a Archetype list of the different lifestyles after being ""red-pilled"".

# The Sigma Male

&gt;A Sigma male is a man who lives outside the hierarchy. He does his own thing and dances to his own beat. A Sigma Male is also very attractive to women, at the top of the socio sexual hierarchy alongside the Alpha.

That's the exact definition of a ""Sigma"". They live outside of society normalcy. Sigmas still have friends and relationships, however have their own mission as well.  Sigmas don't need many things from society and are often self-employed.

**Women:** Has multiple plates, LTR, or an OLTR.

# The Husband

&gt;""The Married Man""

This path is risky. One should only get married if one intends on having children. The Husband knows this risk, and chooses it anyway. He makes enough money on his own to cover the expenses of this adventure. For he aims to be the head of the household.

He owns a house and has children. His wife will take care of his children.

**Women:** He **carefully** vets and examines the women he dates and is on the prowl for a good woman. Which is a rare breed indeed.

# The MGTOW

&gt;Men Going Their Own Way (**MGTOW** /Ààm…™…°ta ä/) is an anti-feminist, misogynist, mostly online community advocating for men to separate themselves from women and from a society which they believe has been destroyed by feminism.

This path, well like or not it is going it's own way. MGTOW used to be very similar to being a ""Sigma"" however, overtime more incels have used it as an excuse for their faggotry.

Being a MGTOW now is essentially the ""sigma"" lifestyle without the pussy.

# The Faggot

&gt;Mr. Limp dick; The professional incel

This path is not recommended. The Faggot has red-pilled knowledge however decides to do nothing with it.

The Faggot does not apply the sidebar. This path is male hamstering at it's finest. *""Knowledge is power""* Is The Faggot's excuse for not meeting women, for he needs to read more. He does not put forward the effort to change himself. The Faggot doesn't put in the work.

Tinder Mistakes You‚Äôre Probably Making,"A guy on my forums posted a thread asking why he wasn‚Äôt having success with Tinder. His pics are solid (probably better than my own pics), and he‚Äôs a little better looking than I am, with more muscle. Yet he‚Äôs only had sex with 2 girls from Tinder.

Good pics and a decent bio are a requirement to getting laid on Tinder, but there‚Äôs a whole host of steps that need to happen after that ‚Äì and a lot of things you can completely screw up. Here‚Äôs a super-quick list of questions to ask yourself if you have good pics but you‚Äôre not getting laid. I‚Äôll flesh some of these out into longer individual articles in the future if there‚Äôs interest.

* Are you **asking for numbers** from girls as soon as possible? (You should aim to do it within about 4 messages you send.) You don‚Äôt want to have long conversations that go on for ages, only to find out the girl doesn‚Äôt want to give you her number. Save time and ask for the number ASAP.
* Does your **bio make it clear what you‚Äôre looking for**, or do you have something that just screams ""boyfriend material"" like, ‚ÄúNice guy looking for a nice girl‚Äù? If you can‚Äôt think of a decent bio (it doesn‚Äôt need to be amazing ‚Äì just not terrible), just steal mine: *‚ÄúWhen I was little, girls hated when I pulled their hair. Funny how some things change.‚Äù*
* Are you **screening girls** (quickly getting rid of the ones who aren‚Äôt DTF and are clearly just wasting time/looking for attention), or are you wasting days/weeks having long conversations that never lead to sex?
* Are you **messaging a tonne of girls** (30-50+ a week) and copy-pasting the same message to them so you‚Äôre efficient? (Don‚Äôt waste time customising messages for each girl ‚Äì that‚Äôs a total waste of your time &amp; isn‚Äôt necessary at all).
* Are you paying for **Tinder Plus and using Boosts** to get more matches? Buy 2 boosts a week ‚Äì use them between 11pm-2am on Friday and Saturday nights. That‚Äôs when you‚Äôll get the most matches from the girls that are most sexually-available.
* Are you making it obvious (through your pics, bio and messages) that **your goal is to get laid** (and not be friends, or ""just see what happens"", or ""have a nice conversation"")? If you‚Äôre not sure how to make it obvious you want sex, just think to yourself, ‚ÄúWhat would a guy who gets laid a tonne do?‚Äù and then just mimic what you think that guy would do. Pretend you‚Äôre a player. *Fake it til you make it.*
* Once you get a number, are you **trying to meet up with the girl as soon as possible** ‚Äì no later than 3 days from when you get her number? People tend to lose interest very fast, so as soon as you get her number, launch straight into ‚ÄúYou free Thursday night?‚Äù (That should literally be your 2nd message after you say ‚ÄúHey it‚Äôs me, sup‚Äù.) Don‚Äôt have long text conversations where you talk for weeks (it's almost always a waste of time), don‚Äôt ask how her day was, don‚Äôt ‚Äúbuild rapport‚Äù, don‚Äôt try and make her like you, don‚Äôt ask what‚Äôs she‚Äôs up to. **She gave you her number so she already likes you** ‚Äì just get her out on the date ASAP.
* If **she won‚Äôt meet you for a date**, or says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not free that day‚Äù more than 2 times, are you deleting her number and moving on? Don‚Äôt waste time on a girl who‚Äôs ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù or ‚Äúhas a crazy schedule‚Äù. Those girls aren‚Äôt that serious about meeting up with you, so don‚Äôt waste your time.
* On the date itself, are you **doing everything you can to steer things towards sex?** Things like holding her hand as soon as you can, touching her, kissing her, inviting her back to your apartment. Or are you playing it too safe and not even trying to kiss her, let alone have sex with her? Are you doing time-wasting, unhelpful things like going to movies/dinner, having long 5 hour dates where you talk too much and waste too much time instead of trying to have sex, etc? Your dates should be: meet for 1 drink in a bar, talk and touch/kiss each other a bit, then say ‚ÄúCome back to my apartment and we‚Äôll hang out for a bit.‚Äù
* On the date, are you **looking your best**, with good fashion that‚Äôs in style? Are you wearing **accessories** (necklace, rings, watch, piercings, tattoos, etc - don't have to have *all* of these, but at least a nice watch/necklace/ring)? Is your **body-fat low-ish** (10-13% is best, 13-15% is decent), are you well-groomed, wearing good cologne, with an in-style haircut?

What I Learnt From Staying Away From Reddit (and TRP) For 1 Year,"**TLDR: Get off Reddit for some time to figure out your real mission. If you are browsing Reddit 4 hours a day, you are not on your mission.**

**Never be scared to dream big. Break the limit of success society (or your parents/friends) imposed on you.**

**If you want to be a millionaire, you can do it.**

**If you want to be jacked, you can do it. And if you want to be jacked, rich and good with women, yes, you can do it.**

**It's not easy, but it's possible, and that's all you need to know to go out and actually start working towards your ideal life. We often confuse ""hard"" with ""impossible"", yet the former implies activity+effort and the latter complete passivity in front of life.**

&amp;#x200B;

Found out TRP in late 2017. Can't thank this sub and some users enough.

I've been reading TRP stuff for like 2 years, until I realized it was time to actually go out in the real world. 

And this is what I've been wanting to write for so long. I have no idea whether anyone will care, nor if ""OG"" users are still here.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started with the realization that Reddit is as dangerous as any other social media. I remember a lot of old posts about cheap dopamine and why it should be avoided. But guess what, even Reddit has been engineered with LOTS of triggers to keep you hooked.

I've been jumping on and off on Reddit in the last months but I wasn't as ""obsessed"" as I once was.

Now, if you are new here, go on and read the sidebar and the top posts. But you'll reach a point where you are actually harming yourself and your brain.

I remember when I couldn't stop opening askTRP and had strong impulses to check out what was going on on the sub. I consciously knew TRP preached having a life mission, **but I had no mission.**

&amp;#x200B;

So eventually, I deleted Reddit and the triggers became weaker and weaker. Something interesting happened, I stopped thinking about women. In fact, that's when I found my real mission.

I realized I wanted to become a wealthy successful guy. Instead of reading the 213904th post about what women want in a man, I started reading business and marketing books: ""The Millionaire Fastlane"", ""The 10X Rule"", ""Dot Com Secrets"" to name a few.

What happened is that my obsession over women slowly disappeared. The reason why I was so obsessed about women was because I made women my goal. Just like in videogames where you are told *""do x and you'll earn y""*, I was doing the same thing, but with women.

Then something else happened. My reality got bigger and bigger. I realized that a lot of guys here limit themselves and the amount of success they can achieve.

If I told you *""aim to become a billionaire by 30""*, you might have negative thoughts arise in your mind. That's a sign that you are limiting the amount of success you THINK you can achieve.

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason why people fail to succeed with their goals, is because they aim too LOW. Yes, the problem is not dreaming too big, the problem is dreaming too little.

If you dream too big, you at least will put the effort necessary to get as closer as possible to that ideal, but if you set your goals too low from the beginning, you'll feel like *""it's easy""* and limit the amount of effort from your part. That's why so many people are satisfied with a certain level of success, and I got told my lots of men *""Why do you stay in front of your PC 12 hours a day?"",  ""Why are your legs are EVEN more muscular than Ronaldo's?"", ""Have some rest!"", ""Enjoy life!""*.

**That's because I chose to be a winner in life.**

People will make you feel like what you are doing is wrong, they will make you feel like you ARE ALONE on this journey. You really are alone. 99.9% of the people out there won't understand why you are going to the gym 5 days a week, why you are working on your project 12 hours a day and why you are reading 2-3 books every month. That's when you have to keep having faith in yourself and look at the mirror, and say, **""It's really all up to me"".  That's when you know you are on your mission. That's a unique feeling I can't even describe.**

&amp;#x200B;

When the only thing you desire is *""getting laid and finding a gf""*, you are limiting your potential. We are programmed to evolve and change the world, yet you decide to limit the amount of success you can achieve. If you are aware of that and have no problems with that, that's 100% up to you.

What I'm saying is, TRP is a tool of immense power, but there will come a day when you have to actually go out there in the real world. You will actually have to take action towards your goals.

And something that TRP ""didn't teach me"" (or I struggled to internalize) is that **you can dream as big as you want. There's no limit to what you can achieve.**

We as human beings like to limit the amount of success we can achieve, because that protects our ego and makes us feel secure. You probably don't need a billion dollar net worth to be happy, but would we argue that the billionaire can experience life from a completely different perspective?

You are reading this post, it means you are ""red-pilled"", or you are in your way to fully unplugging yourself from the blue pill conditioning. Now, imagine how your life could be if you not only started improving your mindset, but also your finances.

Whenever I heard the phrase *""money is for betas""* on here, I always understood that was a very biased thought. Money is for betas if you don't know the Red Pill. But since you are reading this post, you do know it. When you are Red Pilled, money will only be a positive thing because you won't let women walk all over you despite you being rich (aka the famous ""golddiggers"" talk).

Golddiggers is the term used by men who can't say ""No"" and just leave, and instead, engage with these women from a submissive position. That's like being the opposite of a pimp.

To a rich ""alpha"" man, golddiggers are just like any other woman (the old good AWALT). The difference is in how he decides to engage with these women. **And if he decides to engage at all.**

&amp;#x200B;

Money is in my opinion the ultimate goal everyone should strive for. Money buys not only happiness, but freedom. Especially if you are already emotionally self-reliant and red-pilled.

Why is this the ultimate goal? Because it's the hardest goal of all. You may have sex with women, but you'll soon feel lost again. That's because we as human like to work towards goals that are hard, but once we've reached them, we lose that ""**mission feeling**"". The more unattainable a goal seems to be, the more it's a sign you should actually work towards that goal. That's how I put myself into **mission-mode** every, single time.",52,1

Red Pills from A Working Girl,"Long time listener, first time caller. 


Today I'm sharing some gems I heard from a 26yo that moonlights as a sugar baby. Skipping the backstory, I pick her up in my car and she tells me she can't have me in her place bc roommates, and my place was a no go. No worries, as she knows a place.


On the way to the spot we're making small talk and she mentions how she lost her job due to COVID and is on unemployment. Before I can start pretending to feel bad, she starts telling me about how she doesn't need it and is on track to make ~100K from escorting this year.


We get to the spot and do our thing, and we're chatting again on the way back to hers.


She starts talking about how she's in a hurry and needs to get to another date (damn lady, slow down), but a little later says that she's not worried, bc the guy is a regular and gives $1K each date. I'm sure if I asked, she'd tell me all about how guys were tripping over themselves to give her $$$ for just being in her mere presence.


It becomes clear that she's not too keen on fucking for money, and keeps talking about how this lifestyle isn't for her, and that she doesn't *need* to do it, given her dad is well-off on his own, among other things. When I ask if they're on good terms (ofc not), she then starts talking about how her dad and her aren't close after daddy witnessed his precious genius little girl get impregnated by the town druggie, before moving across the country to live with said druggie and his batshit mother.


Right before I drop her off, we start talking about relationships as she mentioned she just got out of a bad one (ofc). According to her, the man's supposed to take care of the woman, and the woman the man. Unlike the rom-com horseshit you hear, she defines the mans job as bringing in the income, and the woman making sure that the household and man are taken care of. As she's hopping out, she says, ""When you're in a relationship, you gotta know he's gonna step out on you; he's a guy. Just what you don't know won't hurt you.""


She said a bunch more shit confirming stuff I've learned here, but the main takeaways I got from this interaction were:


1. Sex is really nothing but a utility to most women to get what they need. It's the best (sometimes only) tool in their arsenal.

2. Everything you hear about daddy issues is 100% on the money.

3. Women don't care/mind if you're fucking other women, as long as they're getting their needs met as well.

4. The female hamster is undefeated.



Also, this interaction really opened my eyes to how manipulative women can be without even trying. During the ride back, I noticed how a lot of the things she was saying typically trigger two main instincts:

Protection

Provision


As she was talking about she gets from each of her Johns, a blooper might get it into his head that HE should be giving her the same. And her talking about all the bad shit happening in her life is prime bait for captain save-a-ho.

I was wondering if any guys here had similar experiences.",148,1
Red Pills from A Working Girl,[removed],2,1
Is my approach wrong in this instance?,[removed],0,1
Shortcuts will cut you short,"  

I am going to tell you the story of Mike. Mike is the average red pill lurker, always seeking new ways to convince women that he is a great ""Alpha"". That‚Äôs what the whole PUA community has convinced him he needs to be doing, find ways to raise interest in a girl, and try to apply them in real life, most of the times still being unsuccessful.‚ÄùHow to inspire confidence?‚Äù Have a lower voice tonality, always be calm etc etc, we all know the story. ‚ÄúWhat should I tell girls when I approach them?‚Äù ‚ÄúThis girl stopped texting me back, how can I get her back?‚Äù What is my point? Your main goal should not be learning a set of things you need to do in order to have more success with women, but the improving of the quality of your life. This is why I hate PUA‚Äôs and love everybody sharing his piece here. They want you to improve your life, not make cash out of you by telling a list of things you need to put into practice to ‚ÄúAppear more Alpha‚Äù. You cannot expect someone to be with you if not even yourself are enjoying time spent alone. You cannot expect somebody else joining your life,  if it sucks more than their reality. Had tens of men ask me about how they are supposed to make women like them in one form or another, like ‚ÄúHow can I be more fun?‚Äù. How the fuck are you expecting to be funny if you are not doing anything fun? Life is not all black and white. Self improvement or decay. Go fucking do shit that you enjoy, try new things out and expand your view. I dare you go to that acting class you‚Äôve always wanted to go for, go on that trip, try to fucking let loose once in a while. Because nobody truly gives a shit about you, besides family and one or two friends at most. Not even that in some cases.

Everybody is so tensed up, but most of you do not realize that in the end, it doesn‚Äôt fucking matter. You are going to die, and everything that you have cared about will be forgotten in a couple years. Everybody is so keen on getting girls.Breaking news: You will never get girls if you are acting like a guy that‚Äôs not getting girls. You want abundance, but mentally, you come from a place where you have none. ‚ÄúBut how am I supposed to act as if I had girls, if I have none?‚Äù  The biggest difference between a guy that‚Äôs fucking lots of girls and a guy that is not, is that he doesn‚Äôt care if he gets to have sex with them. A good example would be money. You care so much about 5 bucks when you have none, but never give a fuck about those same 5 bucks when all is well financially. Same principle applies to women, the only difference being that this isn‚Äôt money. Women are not that important. Sex is overrated. You don‚Äôt need sex to provide for yourself or reach your goals. Realize that it doesn‚Äôt fucking matter if you get that girl or not, and the abundance needed will follow, because you, the same as the guy who spins tens of plates, do not give a fuck whether it works out or not. 

The whole point of this post is to make you realize that by getting the attributes and the mindset of a great guy, the behavior of a great guy will follow. You can either ‚ÄúLearn five new tricks to show confidence‚Äù, or pick up a new hobby and improve your skills regarding it, gaining genuine confidence by getting better. You can either ‚ÄúLearn THE BIGGEST GAME CHANGER for you to be funny‚Äù, or live a life full of new adventures, which will automatically give you a wider view on life, have you think outside the box, directly making you the funny guy. Because that‚Äôs what being funny is. Saying shit that nobody is expecting. You cannot learn creativity. It‚Äôs retarded even trying that. 

Do not be like Mike. Do not go for the shortcut. The hard path is worth it, and the man that you will become by following it will agree.

Side note: If anyone is interested into knowing more about this perspective, I will gladly answer more questions. I am going to write more posts also, but cannot adress my whole views by writting a couple posts.",92,1

You Can Do ANYthing - But Not EVERYthing,"You are now present in a reality that relates to what comes AFTER the End Times. 

The blank page - the untrodden snow - unexplored space. Yet this area I have been through before...

What it means, for you - in real terms - is that you can choose any one thing from within the whole and become the single best expression of it in existence. There is a strict mathematical unfolding sequence relating to the expansion of all known phenomena from a single point to its shape to the sequence to the final structure - once this complete it then appears by itself.

Remember the entire outside world is as real as it is not real. It is not real, yet real is the same as not real, so the not real may as well be real - therefore the art is to master this so-called ""life experience"".

So today I want you to choose your single point of that which you wish to develop towards its manifestation. 

The only way you can ever change your experience or witness something new or fantastic or magical or whatever, is if you are single minded towards an outcome. You can only choose ONE thing at a time. One thing allows your focus and brain to work 100% on that thing. As soon as you want two things then it splits (your consciousness first) into 50% and then the outcomes get fuzzier and fuzzier and fade away.

You must dedicate yourself 100% to the task at hand - immerse yourself in your current ONE goal. 

I set out a few things I aim to complete each day, each an aspect to achieve my overall life goal. I spend so much time when I focus on my one task, such as playing piano, or teaching myself a 3rd language, that I forget I have other things on my to-do list. This is good, as the brain is 100% focused on the one goal.

You cannot want to be ripped one moment, then want to bulk the next. You cant one day say you want to be an MMA fighter, than next day you want to be an artist. You can't spread yourself thin because then your efforts will be nullified.

Pick a few somethings you wish to achieve or be good at, and focus on them, picking one to practice 100%, each day.

In simple terms the universe asks of you to be as precise and clear as possible and focus so it can work for you and create the best possible answers/outcome for you.

What is the one thing that any of you want to experience?

Write to me individually one thing that you want to experience.",12,1

SEDUCING CELEBRITIES: THE ULTIMATE GUIDE,"Many people (betas) think it's ""unrealistic"" to expect a celebrity to sleep with you. However, with a few simple tips and preparation, this couldn't be easier. Just last night, I had loud, passionate sex with Scarlett Johansson, Kim Kardashian, and Emma Watson -- all at once! And you can too.

###Preparation

You'll need several supplies before you begin.

* Lock pick (for entering restricted areas)
* Plastic surgery do-it-yourself kit
* Fake security badge
* Gun

###Selecting a Target

So you've entered the VIP section at a sporting event, or broken into a dressing room at Hollywood. What now? The first step is to find a celebrity with very little mobility -- that is, once you engage them in conversation, it's very difficult for them to escape. The ideal target is one who is a) in a wheelchair or b) blind. It might so happen that there is no one nearby who is clearly handicapped. (That's what the gun is for.)

###Putting on the Charm

Many people (betas) assume that women want what is commonly referred to as a ""decent person."" However, the truth is that women want a dominant, controlling man who hits them when they misbehave. So when I say ""charm,"" I mean psychological manipulation tactics used to garner women's attraction (being a jerk).

I'm the most confident, smooth-talking alpha male there is. That's what all my remaining friends say. How do I do it? Betas will use a strategy known as ""honesty."" But we'll use a far more effective strategy known as the ""insult"" method. Whenever a woman tries to test you, ask you a question, or talks to you, you'll say the most insulting thing that comes to mind. I recommend having a few beers beforehand, as this will help bypass your internal editor and allow you to come up with more insulting (albeit nonsensical) responses.

For example, if a woman says to you, ""Hey! Stop touching me,"" or ""How did you find my address? This is private property,"" don't respond honestly, as a beta would. (""I stole your wallet."") Instead, respond with an insult. (""You're ugly."")

Come to think of it, ""You're ugly,"" pretty much works with everything, although with Scarlett Johansson, it also took insulting her intelligence and weight.

###Final Step

However, there's one final step on which everything depends. Don't even consider trying the first few steps on their own. Without this final step, the entire plan collapses, and you wouldn't be able to seduce your own...

Advice for a young man,"
Summary: I am new to Red Pill and need advice for picking up girls in college using red pill philosophy. 


Post Body:  I‚Äôm going off to college shortly and while I‚Äôve had success with girls in high school, I want to bang all the dimes possible at my university. I‚Äôll start off by explaining that I‚Äôm a great student and that comes first to me. I do not care about finding ‚Äúthe one‚Äù or any of the typical beta bullshit. My goal is to chase the bag to enable my family to live in luxury. 

That being said, I know I‚Äôd enjoy my time a lot more if after a long day of grinding I could have a hot girl coming to my dorm on demand. I‚Äôve never really landed the 10/10 girl before. I workout regularly and I‚Äôm in good shape, I like to think I have a good fashion sense, I‚Äôm not immature, etc. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm between a 7-8 on attractiveness and with a couple more months of lifting I‚Äôll probably be an 8/9 on pure looks. While I‚Äôm a strong believer that you can always improve, and I am not content with where I‚Äôm at, there are worse looking dudes getting dimes. 

I guess where I‚Äôm having problems is maintaining my frame and approaching women. I think 90% of the girls I talk to are immature little twats incapable of carrying a conversation. Therefore, I tend to lose my frame in an attempt to keep the conversation alive. I‚Äôm struggling to connect with women without it coming off as either a pickup attempt (giving validation, losing frame) or a friend/ non sexual male ( gossipy, stooping to their level). 

Ironically, the girls I have gotten with has been through total beta moves that make me cringe the more I think about them. Seriously, I didn‚Äôt even know what mistakes I was making and I probably broke every single red pill rule early on (proving that I am at least a decent looking dude). I‚Äôve found alpha mentality and red pill recently, but internally I know this is a vastly better method for not just getting pussy but living my life. So help me understand what the initial conversation of a red pill would look like especially when approaching the hottest girl at the gathering. Cheers!",28,1
"I Don't ""Make Love"" Anymore","TL/DR:  Assert your dominance in the bedroom.  If you're like me leaving a life of insecurity, the idea of choking, spanking, etc in the bedroom can seem disrespectful or take you as surprise.  You gotta fuck the shit out of her though.  Wrap your hands around her neck, push her down on the bed, and show her a side of passion that's less romantic and more animalistic.

Here's my story in reaching this conclusion:

In the past two years, I have gone from being insecure in my relationship with my now ex-wife to nearly a sense of arrogance over the number of women I've been with.  I've gone from feeling like I'd forever be alone to nutting on a woman's face, tossing her a towel, and leaving her in bed naked yelling ""where are you going?"" and never hearing from me again.

You would think that would be enough to cause a woman to be disgusted and yet I woke up the next morning to so many messages alternating between how badly she wanted to see me again and absolute anger that I was ignoring her (I was asleep) that I decided the red flags weren't even worth a response.

And that's why I no longer ""make love"" to women.  I fuck the shit out of them.

I respect them and treat them well, but I absolutely shove their heads into the pillow when their face is down and their ass is up.

It's like a switch flips in their brain.

And you might think maybe that's just this one girl I was with, but my anecdotal evidence suggests that if you want to keep a woman invested in you and coming back for more, how you handle yourself (or herself rather) in the bedroom plays a key role.

My plan with her was to just leave her on 'read' and block her stage 5 clinger ass on everything...except Venmo apparently.  At some point, while exhausting all her options to get in touch with me to no avail, she realized she had sent me money on there a while back and proceeded to comment on the transaction with how badly she wanted me to throw her on the bed.

And then something she wrote struck me:  ""I like that you're genuinely a good guy, but that you fuck me like we're toxic.""

Although I had sort of figured it out without even realizing it, for some reason those words sort of clicked in my head.  That was the missing component in so many of my prior relationships right after my divorce.  Suddenly there was a light bulb moment where I started to understand that to a certain degree that was why I was divorced (among other reasons), but ultimately that for a period of time even after I was becoming more masculine and confident out in public, I was still lacking a certain trait in the bedroom that was failing to really hook women in.

Let's take a step back though.

I met my ex-wife in high school and we were together for 14 years.  We were virgins to each other - d'awww.  When we divorced, I thought it was the absolute worst thing that could ever happen to me.  Depressed and arguably questioning the value of my life, I was certain I'd never find love again.  Turns out, that was the defining break up I needed.  It was sort of incredible how confident I was able to become once I picked myself up and allowed myself to be selfish for once.  

I learned I'm a high-value man in a world of desperate, single women in their 30s.

This is an entirely new mindset than I've ever had before.  Listen, I want to get married again and find a forever love that'll wipe my ass, make me sandwiches, and still suck my dick at 75 years old, but I have a whole new perspective on dating from a point of confidence.  I'm not going to marry the person I can, I'm going to marry the person I want.  It's an incredibly liberating feeling that I'm in a position for women to reach to be with me rather than the other way around.  

I mean, I still punch above my weight class on occasion from a long term relationship standpoint, as some of the real stunners know their worth is still someone above my current socioeconomic status.  That said, I'm secure in my options though and that's really very new to me relative to my age and where I was at mentally not long ago.  I never really transitioned out of being a quintessential ""niceguy"" when I met my ex-wife in high school because nothing ever happened to me that pushed me to require it.  I wouldn't say I was a white knight, but I was just the guy that consistently heard ""you're amazing"" but never actually ""got it in"" with anybody telling me how amazing I was.  When the first girl that showed interest in me came along, I clung to that out of desperation.  I was oblivious to how I was being used and too insecure to kick her to the curb when I should have early on.

Her infidelity was inexcusable, but ultimately, she was looking elsewhere for the same reasons I would continue losing women early on my dating life post-divorce.  I was ""making love"" to my ex-wife while other guys were fucking her.  

I wasn't doing anything in the bedroom that made her feel like she was powerless against me.  Sure, hopeless romantic shit is cool for Valentine's Day and my ex-wife appreciated soft, romantic sessions of coitus, but I never really tapped into her circuits that made her feel submissive to me in the bedroom - and that would make its way outside the bedroom where she would disrespect me by fucking other guys that were able to tap into those emotions of her wanting to feel overpowered.  I think in that feeling of being overpowered in the bedroom, she was able to make the idea of being protected outside of it tangible.

Once I realized I actually was a high-value male and started getting numerous Tinder matches, I quickly found myself in bed with my first rebound.  I remember she looked at me and said ""do whatever the fuck you want to me"".  

And it kind of blew my mind.  

I mean, I didn't think a whole lot of it in that moment, but I remember the next morning I woke up beside her for breakfast she said: ""last night was fun, but you don't have to be so gentle"".

I ended up breaking up with her because women started DMing me.  That's unheard of right?!  

And yet, there I was accepting friend requests and DMs from women.  I started sort reconsidering if I was settling into the rebound when clearly I was capable of pulling other women and potentially casually dating multiple at the same time.  Let me tell you, rejecting a woman is an incredibly powerful moment also.

The next girl I dated was incredibly gorgeous and we hit it off like crazy.  But I remember one night as we had had sex, she looked at me and whispered ""choke me"".  I was absolutely taken aback.  This girl was gorgeous - like model fucking gorgeous.  The type that you think will just lay there while you hump and she's literally asking me to treat her like she's a cum slut. 

I couldn't wrap my head around that.

And that's why we fizzled out.  I lost an incredibly gorgeous girlfriend because I was too nice to be dominant to her in bed.  For some reason, despite watching guys doing that in porn and wanting to do it to her, I just couldn't bring myself to see it as anything other than disrespectful.

The girl after her was a very similar situation.  I literally had my penis inside her vagina when she looked at me and said ""you're just so nice"".  And we fizzled out, too.

My next girlfriend after her dated me for quite a while.  She was like 5'-2"", 100 pounds and super innocent and cute.  I actually broke up with her because I wasn't really into having 5 kids between us, but on one occasion we were talking and she said: ""so, I like to get a little freaky and I never really realized I liked getting my ass spanked until I hooked up with a guy and he did it without asking"".

Eventually, the gears would finally start rolling and I began to piece the missing link in.  Women were literally spelling it out for me.  

It had nothing to do with my penis size.  Nothing to do with my oral skills.  Nothing to do with how I looked.  Nothing to do with my personality at all.  Nothing to do with my income.  

Finally, I was able to read between the lines.  It wasn't that I was bad at sex, I was just too inadvertently submissive.  I required ""too much"" consent and not enough proactiveness about it.

High-value, attractive women can have it all.  They weren't settling when they dated me.  They weren't settling when they decided to hop into bed with me.  But I was failing to assert my dominance in the bedroom and that was a settling aspect to the relationship for them.  

What these women wanted was income, personality, looks, and a good fuck. This is why 50 Shades of Grey, 365 Days, and similar entertainmrnt have such mainstream media appeal for women.

Eventually, I would start to slowly become a little more aggressive.  I'd end up hooking up with some mature people that communicated and taught me things.

What I found that helped me get there was to gradually push myself to be more firm with my hands.  I began by just grabbing ass with a little more intensity and eventually, one day I just took a slap...and that bitch loved it!

I can't say for certain all girls are going to appreciate having their hair pulled, a good spank, or feeling your hands around their neck (consent is important), but from my personal experience over the last couple of years and multiple ""entanglements"", to quote Tenacious D, ""you don't always have to fuck her hard, sometimes that's just not right to do, sometimes you got to make some love and give her some fucking smooches to""

...but the vast majority of the time you should fuck her brains out and assert your masculine dominance in the bedroom.",101,1
From Introvert to Extravert: A guide on going from zero to hero socially,"I misspelled the title... classic. 

I‚Äôve been approaching a lot recently and reconnecting my social circle. I realized how much progress I have made in terms of social skills and I decided to share what I‚Äôve learned in this guide as I‚Äôve been at this for about two years now. 


To start, I will say that being extroverted is about being more focused on others and the moment than yourself. If you can train yourself to do this you can interact with people with no effort and actually enjoy it. This is not to say ignore your values, needs, and desires, but to stop focusing on every action you make. 


Growing up, I was always introverted. Despite this, I still had one of the largest social circles and a lot of acquaintances.

In this guide I will tell you how you can get a larger social circle as well as how can become more extroverted.

As I said, I was introverted, so I never spoke a lot, but, I always was listening. I could genuinely connect with people and could always chime in with a witty or insightful comment. 


**First Lesson: Learn the skill of active listening**

Listen to people and respond accordingly and you will easily make friends. Realize that other people are just like you, very complicated and interesting. Develop a genuine interest in people and it will be a lot easier to connect with them. To sum it up. Be interested to be interesting.

Some tips:

Learn to be present in the moment through meditation.



Once you learn how to actively listen and be interested in what people have to say, you can turn it up a level by paying attention to their body language. I‚Äôm naturally good at this, so when I started to focus on it, it came easily. For others, it might not be so easy. That being said, body language is the majority of communication so you must learn to use it and read it. 


**Second lesson: Learn to tune in to people‚Äôs body language**

In order to do this you need to learn to make eye contact. If you are not good with eye contact, start by looking at everyone you walk by and holding eye contact till they break it. Then start holding eye contact occasionally in conversation. Over time you will get a feel for what it is and how to use it. 

Otherwise always be paying attention to their body, posture, tone of voice, etc. 

I‚Äôve heard good things about the book ‚ÄúWhat every body is saying‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt read it myself, but I might give it a look. 


Now that you‚Äôre able to pay attention to other people, by listening and watching, you need to learn how to converse with them. 


**Third lesson: Learn how to have good conversations**

You can start by asking questions about the other person. Good topics are FORD topics. Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams (something like that). These topics are good for getting to know people (especially if you‚Äôre genuinely interested in them). 

You can talk about things that interest you  or that you know about when they‚Äôre related to the topic of conversation or are brought up. 

You can tell stories and jokes when they come to mind. 

Important things to remember with conversation:

If they‚Äôre talking to you, they don‚Äôt dislike you. If you like them, they probably like you. Get out of your head and enjoy the moment and enjoy connecting with another person

You do not need to impress people with your conversation skills. This goes back to the last one. You don‚Äôt need  to try to get the other person to like you or be impressed with you. Just have fun.

It‚Äôs a conversation. It is cooperative by nature. Become comfortable with silence, it is not always your job to fill it. Let the other person chime in with a comment or question. 


Okay, so now I‚Äôve told you the skills you are looking to develop and some mindsets to have while developing them. How then, do you actually develop the skills? You practice by talking to people.


**First practical step: Meet people and talk to them**

You need to meet and talk to people. You need to talk to people in your classes, you need to go to the gym and talk to people there, you need to talk to people at lunch. You need to talk to people everywhere. In line at a coffee shop, at the bus stop, on the train, literally everywhere. 

By doing this you will become accustomed to being around people and you will get good at talking to people, especially when you implement the stuff above. 

I would say that the biggest thing that hindered my social skills was anxiety. By talking to people you will learn to face that anxiety making you a stronger person and improving your social skills. 


Naturally, you will not be forming meaningful relationships with these people. So now you need to meet quality people that you can spend time with regularly.


**Second practical step: Join clubs and groups**

You definitely have some interests. Chess, books, law, wrestling, whatever. Find a club for it and join it. Here you will find people with similar interests that you will meet with regularly. Now you‚Äôre part of a social circle. 

If you‚Äôre in college look at fraternities as well. Don‚Äôt have a negative impression of them just due to stereotypes. Look for one with like minded people. 

The bottom line is: you need to join some organized social group. 

Sports teams are also great. In my opinion there is nothing that bonds men better than training and competing with each other. 

In order to form relationships you need to spend time with other people. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you do. Eat lunch, go for a walk, whatever, as long as you are spending time together. 


**Conclusion:**

By constantly talking to people and improving your social skills, by tuning in to people‚Äôs physical and verbal communication, by becoming genuinely interested in people, and by becoming fun to talk to and thus more confident, you will ultimately become more extroverted. 

It is about talking to everyone and forming and maintaining quality relationships. Be focused on others, not yourself. 


**Some tips:**

You will get rejected. Some people won‚Äôt like you, won‚Äôt want to talk to you, won‚Äôt give you the time of day. Good. Now you know. You won‚Äôt care about it tomorrow, so don‚Äôt care about it now. 

Become more assertive. Say no to things you don‚Äôt want to do. Be in tune with your own desires and needs and get them met. 

And, it wouldn‚Äôt be a trp post if I didn‚Äôt tell you to lift. In all seriousness, lifting will make people more receptive you. It will make more people attracted to you on a physical level, and you will generally command a larger presence. 


**Final note:**

This is not a guide on flirting. I have recently developed good social skills and now I will move on to learning how to flirt properly. Maybe when I learn that I will share what I‚Äôve learned as well. 

Hope this helps.

Brutally Effective Strategy For Dealing With Guys Who Try To Steal Your Girl,"As a shorter guy, this is something I see quite a lot of: I open a girl, flirt with her, tease her, she‚Äôs having a good time.

All of a sudden, a random guy approaches and tries to interrupt me.

I don‚Äôt see this happen nearly as often to taller guys 6‚Äô0‚Äù but for me, it happens just about in any setting, even Parties and Meetup events. Another guy comes up and interrupts the conversation and spits his own version of game.

This was incredibly frustrating for a while and I tried just about everything to try to overcome it. I tried agree and amplify to whatever underhanded insult the other guy threw my way. But that would quickly devolve into the girl losing interest in both me and the other guy since it was just 2 guys trying to one up each other... not good

I tried going on the attack and insulting the other guy‚Äôs fashion or comparing him to a dumb movie character... but same thing as before, this would just result in 2 guys fighting over one girl, which means the girl loses interest.

I even tried going the apocalypse route. ‚ÄúYou... get the fuck out of here now! Or I‚Äôll fucking murder you!‚Äù to try to intimidate them into leaving but unfortunately, this scared the girl off too. Really dumb on my part please don‚Äôt do this. I‚Äôm lucky I didn‚Äôt get killed.

I finally discovered the secret after I tried to interrupt another dude‚Äôs set and steal his girl. He didn‚Äôt insult me. He didn‚Äôt even look my way. And that‚Äôs the secret. Total and complete ignoring, like a king would do if a peasant approached him. His girl remained glued to him, and even told me to go away!

This was incredible! I began applying and modifying this new discovery and found that this is by far the most effective way of dealing with guys that try to steal your girl. It demonstrates that the guy is such low value that he‚Äôs not even worth your time to notice.

In fact, I made a slight modification after dealing with one too many persistent guys that got angry and kept trying to enter the conversation anyways: apologizing on their behalf!

I still wouldn‚Äôt even so much as glance at the other guy. He‚Äôs not worthy of my attention. But I would ‚Äúapologize‚Äù to the girl on his behalf. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, we keep getting interrupted, my apologies‚Äù.

What this does is it conveys that not only is the other guy not worthy of attention, but also that his social intelligence is so low, he can‚Äôt even recognize that he‚Äôs interrupting and thus, I have to ‚Äúapologize‚Äù on his behalf the way a Dad would for his misbehaving son!

At this point, usually the girl will tell the other guy to leave! Same thing that happened to me. Simple, brutally effective strategy to prevent other guys from stealing your girl.

Of course, all this goes out the window if the guy knows the girl. For that you‚Äôll need actual social skills to befriend the guy.",253,1
What is a boyfriend?,"Really, it is so vague. Literally any casual relationship can be termed as a boyfriend.
I have observed that it is a trend to use this term by women nowadays to cover up any relationship they have. They are using it as a newly found freedom and to avoid slutshaming. You want to fuck that guy? Just make him your boyfriend and fuck as much as you want with no consequences! Just break up later. It is basically a combination of friend, fuckboy and husband. There are elements of commitment but still casual or can even be sexless. She can be single with a boyfriend or have multiple boyfriends.
I do not know why men obsess over cheating so much when she has had dozens of 'boyfriends' before you who she is very well granted to fuck with. So just when she is with you now does her past disappear? What if you are just one of those boyfriends? Does she have any pair bonding ability left? Will she not want to go back in the wild again?

I made a table to see where a boyfriend stands and it is ambigious as hell.

Is there?     | Friendship | Commitment | Sex |

The mysterious case of Ted Bundy: Redpill?,"Just so there‚Äôs no confusion: I believe Ted Bundy was a despicable, horrible and vile person.


I love murder mysteries and crime documentaries. I recently finished watching several Ted Bundy films, and I decided to do more research on the man. What I discovered after looking into his case shocked me--after looking through his story from a redpill lense. What I'm about to present comes from my knowledge of Ted Bundy through online research, documentaries, and his Wikipedia page:

Ted Bundy was a ""hopeless romantic"" who couldn't find love in high-school. This changed when he met the gorgeous Stephanie Brooks in college, and they soon began a relationship. Bundy was *obsessed* with Brooks, and pictured her as the perfect woman and he was in awe that she was his. He was by all accounts, ""madly in love"". Mind you, Bundy came from an extremely dysfunctional family, and suffered from abandonment issues that many on this forum have experienced. He finally found someone who would love him for who he was(satire).  However, as anyone familiar with the Repill knows, this same obsession and unconditional love from men is what kills attraction--as it inevitably did in Bundy's case. Brooks dumped Bundy, citing his ""lack of ambition""(Wikipedia page). Female Hypergamy at its finest. I also read in an article that Brooks dumped Bundy because he was--by her own words--""weak""(COULDNT HOLD FRAME). Bundy was absolutely devastated and heartbroken. A former co-worker of Bundy claims that the breakup is what drove him to insanity--but I digress. Bundy later admitted as he says in the Bundy Netflix documentary, that he was obsessed, from that moment on, with getting revenge on Brooks. So, he became a high value man, and dramatically rose his SMV. He became a standout student in University, attaining honors. He became very involved in politics, and was looked upon as a rising political star. He also set his mind on attending Law School--a goal all of his professors thought he could do. However, through all of this self improvement, Bundy never forgot about Brooks(Oneitis). An interesting thing happened however--Bundy met another woman named Elizabth and began a sexual relationship with her. Two years after Brooks dumped Bundy, while on a Business trip with the Republican Party, Bundy reconnected with Brooks. They met for dinner, and she MARVELED at his transformation. He was confident, ambitious, and on the cusp of a brilliant legal and political career(Wikipedia). Brooks then took Bundy back and even offered to help pay for Law School(Hypergamy once more). The important thing to note is that Bundy was still engaged in a relationship with Elizabeth. From a redpill perspective, Bundy was less needy to Brooks because he A.) Had another option B.) Had a mission and C.) Was a much more confident man. Eventually, Bundy ghosted brooks and he admitted he only rekindled his relationship with Brooks just so he could reject her like she rejected him. Bundy began his murder spree very shortly after.

&amp;#x200B;

The story of Ted Bundy is remarkable. Bundy's story is littered with Redpill material that the average person is oblivious to(Hypergamy, Self improvment etc). However, the tragic thing is, Bundy improved himself for a woman--not himself. When he eventually got said woman, he was left with a deep hole and hatred which led to him becoming a serial killer.

Why you should never show emotion in front of a woman,"Most of us know why to never display emotions in front of a woman. They will always see you as less than and lose respect for you.

My (31m) wife (30f) says I don't have the right to be upset about losing our child

My wife and I have been together 6 years and married 2. We have always wanted kids but wanted to wait ans not rush at the start of our marriage. The pregnancy came as a surprise but a very welcomed and happy one. 

Everything went smoothly throughout the pregnancy. There were nevernany signs of issues. We decorated the nursery together and put up the furniture. We were so excited to meet our baby and be parents. She carried to term and the day of the birth again things were ok. She gave birth and we didn't hear any crying. We were so confused and you can see it in the doctors' eyes that they were very concerned. I can't begin to explain the heartbreak when we were told that our little girl didn't make it. We were able to hold her and she was so beautiful. 

A funeral home has a free funeral service for little angels so we buried ours just the two of us.I have never seen a casket so small. I have been trying to be strong for my wife. I only cry when she's not around so when she needs me I'm there. It's been hard to stay strong when she's crying in my arms. Seeing her like this adds to the pain.

Last night I couldn't hold it in and started bawling with her. She didn't like that at all. She started saying that I was trying to make it about me. How I should be the man and support her. She also said that I don't have the right to be so upset because I wasn't the one carrying her and giving birth. She went to bed and left me there.

I know she has it worse than me because she carried our angel and have birth to her. I just didn't expect her to react that way. But I lost my daughter too. I wanted to be a father, I didn't get to change her diaper for the first time and spend my first sleepless night with her crying. I lost her too. 

I know that my wife is hurting which is why she's reacting that way. How do I support her better but also let her know how I feel in a way that doesn't seem like I'm taking away from her?",97,1

"Yes, you can have female friends. In fact, you should.","I‚Äôm sick of seeing this spouted over-and-over on TRP

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have female friends. There‚Äôs no point! It‚Äôs a waste of time‚Äù

You guys are fucking retarded, I‚Äôm sorry.

I‚Äôve had my ups-and-downs when it comes to sexual and dating success.

And by far the most successful times I‚Äôve had were when I had several ‚Äúclose‚Äù female friends.

1) If you‚Äôre the one deciding that the relationship is purely platonic, women will pretty much do anything you want them to. Oftentimes you don‚Äôt even have to ask. If it‚Äôs a girl that you consider below your SMV she will bend-over backwards to do things for you, just to get the validation of being in your life. I can‚Äôt tell you how many free drugs, rides, and social invitations I‚Äôve gotten from women without giving anything in return besides my company. Seriously, when a girl is below your SMV, yet you choose to give them your company, they will break their backs to try to ‚Äúcompensate‚Äù their own lack of value in the dichotomy. They‚Äôll cook for you, they‚Äôll buy you gifts. It‚Äôs insane. You think only women can have orbiters? Nonsense. You can have your own female orbiters if you‚Äôre high value.

2) Networking!!! This should be a no-fucking-brainer. Dating and sex is all about networking. You might not want to fuck her, but chances are she has plenty of friends that you would definitely want to fuck.

3) It hones your social skills and your ability to communicate with women. You can learn how women think and behave just by having female friends. You don‚Äôt have to go through all of the hard work of reading game and doing cold approaches.

4) I‚Äôve found some women to be way less superficial when it comes to conversation topics compared to men. Oh the shit-storm I‚Äôm gonna get for saying this. But I‚Äôm saying it. Some women are way better at having ‚Äúdeep‚Äù conversations about life, humanity, spirituality, etc. than men. At least most of the men I‚Äôve come across just want to talk about ‚Äúthings‚Äù (sports, trucks, lifting, etc.) Women, on the other hand, love to talk about the deeper things in life. So if you‚Äôre like me and love spirituality, philosophy, humanity etc.; women are way more open to discuss those kinds of topics.

There‚Äôs one caveat here. If it‚Äôs a female friend below your SMV that you would never fuck, **you can‚Äôt make that obvious.** If she flirts, you can flirt a little bit back. Keep the idea of sex and relationship as ambiguous as possible. The reason she is your friend is that she hopes she can fuck you, again, she‚Äôs the female equivalent of an orbiter. So always, always act like sex is a possibility and hold it in front of her like a carrot.

My female friendships have always ended usually due to me accidentally coming off as completely disinterested sexually

But by far; the most valuable female friend you can have is one in which; you‚Äôre both mutually sexually interested but not emotionally invested at all.

The best female friend I had was one with whom I had sexual chemistry with, but she was in a relationship and I was emotionally invested in another girl at the time. She sucked my dick a couple times, but other than that, we really were ‚Äújust friends.‚Äù

We would talk-and-talk for hours about everything. I learned a lot from her and she learned a lot from me.

I didn‚Äôt have a car at the time and I could literally get her to drive me anywhere, any time.

She introduced me to a lot of her single friends. Better ‚Äúwingman‚Äù than any male I‚Äôve ever known.",413,1
[Masculinity Amidst Madness] Take Back the Duty to Understand,"**The second post in my dissection of [MASCULINITY AMIDST MADNESS](https://amzn.to/3eQ5SWY) by Ryan Landry (The New American Sun, formerly Social Matter and the Weimerica Weekly podcast). For this post, we'll be looking at Chapter 02 and TAKING BACK THE DUTY TO UNDERSTAND.**

(Note that this series of essays serve as *my own reaction* to *portions* of Landry's book that I find particularly interesting- these essays do not serve to encapsulate the book as a whole, recap the book, or replace reading his excellent and practical meditations on media toxicity regarding masculinity, and how to reclaim a sense of masculine purpose in a toxic world.)

&gt; ""One of the greatest media lies is that reading fiction is a joy because no one is trying to sell you anything. It is a lie because in every character, in every situation, and in every choice, values nd ideals are being framed as good or bad"" (11)

**To save you a little bit of time, I'll start at the end: the problem is democracy.** In a democracy, you are a pawn in a power game that is much larger than you, or your community, and one that doesn't give a fuck about you- democracy is the true Terminator scenario of Skynet becoming self-aware; democracy is a self-perpetuating, disingenuous and immoral [machine](https://amzn.to/32PLQd3).

Alexis de Tocqueville called democracy the ""tyranny of the [majority](https://amzn.to/3eRhucf),"" which is something they won't teach you in public school History class- which serves as a microcosm of the larger problem; all classes in public schools are infomercials for democracy. As a microcosm of the problem as a whole, the issue becomes that in a democracy, *nothing is genuine*. Everything in a democracy is selling you a political agenda for you to gladly accept as true, and support in whatever small ways that you can (vote and then STFU).

Outside of public school, whose English and History curriculum can be more accurately described as *political meme transmission* rather than any kind of skill building, or nuanced understanding of the complexity of the human experience, **Hollywood- people who are highly invested in seizing and maintaining political power, infuse everything they make with the same political memes**- maybe even more so, as television and film is the easiest medium to manipulate and can too easily be confused with reality. Have you ever had a friend take romantic advice based on what worked in some 80's rom-com? People confuse fiction with reality.

Everything around you is pulling you in a political direction, because this is the nature of the demon machine that is democracy- and, therefore, there is very little reliable truth in what you're being told. This is why you read [old books](https://amzn.to/2CBOPuM) on history, written closer to the actual events being described, rather than textbooks. 

**Don't accept the textbook version of life! Don't blindly believe what you're told! Don't allow others to interpret reality for you- especially when it takes tremendous hoop jumping and sophistry to even swallow any of it! Look to what they say you aren't allowed to question or criticize and the game they're playing becomes obvious!**

Reminder: Keep Your Problems To Yourself,"
My main girl (a cute, fit, orgasm-machine of a woman) was telling me about her ‚Äúproblems‚Äù earlier today and a classic shit test popped up on my radar. As I‚Äôve experienced it many times before and read ALL about it here on TRP, it seemed like a good experience to share.

I want to preface this by saying that we have been seeing each other for over a year and have gotten a good bit closer over the past six months so I‚Äôm reaching the point where some men may find themselves getting more comfortable with the idea of opening up to their lady friends. 

As she starts confessing her issues with the problems she‚Äôs currently facing in her life, she paused and thought for a minute.....and told me I should have a drink with her because it makes it easier to talk about our feelings. 

LOL. OUR feelings????? That‚Äôs funny. I see where this is going.

I laughed and looked at her and asked her how she was doing....as she clearly had something on her mind.....

And like the solid, slightly invested guy that I am, I listened and nodded and answered her requests for advice for 5-10 minutes before I made my move to steer the interaction to something a little more fun. 

She proceeded to tell me how her life is so different this year compared to last year and how ‚Äúshe‚Äôs having a hard time adjusting right now....blahblahblah...‚Äù

‚ÄúI used to have this friend and these co-workers who I would check in with weekly and for whom I was a confidant... and I miss having that in my life...blahblahblah....‚Äù

‚ÄúI miss having people tell me their problems and being there for somebody.‚Äù

Oh really, do ya now?

Anybody see where that drink was supposed to come into play yet? Rookie move lady.

So I decide it‚Äôs time to steer things and get back to the good times at hand and I make a joke and ask her to go make me a cup of coffee. 

‚ÄúOk!‚Äù she says as she hops up off the couch.

On her way to the kitchen she looks back at me and asks, ‚ÄúSelf-honest, why don‚Äôt you ever share your problems with me?‚Äù

BOOM. Been waiting for that one for a good 10 minutes at this point. Nice casual buildup by her, but I didn‚Äôt take the bait so she had to come straight with it.

My life flashes before my eyes. The real problems I‚Äôm facing, intentionally, as a man are ten times as serious and dramatic and REAL as the ‚Äúproblems‚Äù she invents for drama in her own life.

If she only knew the risks and consequences and magnitude of the shit on my plate right now....

With a sly look I responded back, ‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt have any problems, babe.‚Äù

Now let‚Äôs be real. She‚Äôs not an idiot. She knows I‚Äôm a human being and we all face problems in our lives. I mean...shit...Covid-19 lockdown has me furloughed for the past 4 months, I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll work again, if I‚Äôll have unemployment money for much longer, when I‚Äôll be able to resume my normal social life, when I‚Äôll be able to go to the gym to fix my shrinking muscle mass....god the list seems endless right now like I‚Äôm sure it is for a lot of you guys out there... so on the real, she knows I‚Äôm just playing the game when I say I don‚Äôt have any problems. 

She paused for a second, ‚Äú........am I a problem for YOU?‚Äù she asked very provocatively.

I chuckled and shot her another look, ‚ÄúYou????‚Äù I laughed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have annnyyy problems and somehow YOU are a problem?! my only problem??? You‚Äôre funny baby‚Äù

She smiled, then she literally ran like a little kid and flopped onto her bed, telling me to come jump and flop next to her.

‚ÄúWhy does flopping into bed never get old?!‚Äù she asked as she moved her face close to mine and wrapped her legs around me.

I kissed her. 

I‚Äôll spare the rest of the details only to say, the intensity and passion of a woman possessed is unrivaled.

In the past I might have felt that there was a point where opening up was equivalent to moving the relationship forward with a woman or something that signified a certain status we had achieved together. 

Had I told her of my concerns and fears for the present and future I promise the outcome would have been VERY different to say the least. 

Happy hunting. Your intermingling with women should be about having fun and spreading good vibes. Keep your problems to yourself. 

TL;DR
Be a fun loving guy who doesn‚Äôt need or want a mommy figure in his life or be prepared to get grounded and sent to your room all alone without dinner.",317,1

Alpha Male Habits: The Art of Embellishment,"By any standard, my Uncle ""Lee"" is an Alpha male - multimillionaire, many women over the years, has lifted for 45 years and still has an incredible physique for a man of *any* age, never mind one in his sixties. This is the type of guy who was into extreme skiing, motor sports, and has received many injuries from a lifetime of crazy shit. 

In his younger years, he was apparently quite the wild man. One story that he likes to tell is how he tricked his high school into giving him permission to ride his motorcycle around the building. The principal told him to ask the vice principal for permission, while the vice principal told him to ask the principal for permission, so he took that as tacit approval. Some project or something, I don't remember the context. The way he tells the story, he actually road his bike *through* the building, as in down the hallways.

His stories - and there are many Uncle Lee stories - always feature him doing some insane bad boy stunt. As kids, my sisters and I would sit there enraptured...*tell us what happened next! What did the principal say? Did you get in trouble?* 

Through other family members, I later got a different version of that event. ""Uncle Lee exaggerates. He just drove his motorcycle *outside* around the building."" 

\------------------------------------

I've known a few Alpha males in my life, and if there's one thing that they all have in common (besides the usual behaviors that we discuss here), it's that they have a tendency to embellish. They exaggerate stories and accomplishments. They don't fabricate out of whole cloth - most of the stories have at least some kernel of truth - but at best, it's borderline. 

Donald Trump called it ""truthful hyperbole"" in his book. People *want* to believe that some fantastical event really happened. They want to believe that something is the best, the greatest of all-time, YUGE, and fantastic. Women (and most men) don't live exciting lives. Instead, they live vicariously through Alpha male experience. 

In high school, an Alpha teacher told the class a hilarious story about surviving a flash flood while volunteering in India, the roaring water ripping off his clothes and leaving him butt naked in front of the entire village. We're all sitting there laughing, and I sorta think to myself *did that really happen?* Maybe it did, maybe it didn't. It doesn't matter. You want to believe it, and you come back for more because you enjoy the excitement.

# Honesty Is Not The Best Policy

Let's turn now to the main reason we're all here - putting our cocks into vaginas. 

One common thread on askTRP concerns the guy with little or no sexual experience. *Are girls turned off by a guy who has no experience?* 

Debate over such a question is meaningless, because it's taking place within a Blue Pill framework. We're conditioned by the likes of Oprah and Dr. Phil into believing that honesty is the best policy. It's simply taken for granted in an ""open communication"" world that the girl already knows, or should know, that the dude is inexperienced. 

But here's my answer: why does she have to know that information in the first place? My solution is simple - lie your ass off. Or if that's too unpalatable for you, just think of it as *embellishment.* 

I didn't kiss a girl until I was 21 years old. It was sloppy. She asked if I had ever kissed a girl before. I lied and said I did at a dance in high school. 

The second girl that I ever fucked asked me about my n-count.  She thought I was some major player. I lied and said I would need two hands to tally them all. 

The point is, none of these girls were ever the wiser. They accepted the answers, and I never admitted the truth. How the hell would they know? I created my own exaggerated reality, they enthusiastically entered it, and we were all happier for it. 

Many guys think that men ought to ""say what they mean, and mean what they say."" It's a very naive, almost child-like way of viewing the world. They don't realize that they're playing life by a set of rules that Alpha males completely ignore. 

The reality is that Alpha men and bullshit usually go hand in hand. Alpha male charisma generates ""reality distortion fields,"" as an Apple employee once characterized Steve Jobs's bullshittery. Not to say that they're paper tigers - again, they always have *something* tangible to back up the perception. They fake it even after they've made it, because it's in their nature. 

IDGAF doesn't necessarily mean you own up to every truth. Oftentimes, it means you know the real story...you just don't give a fuck about lying. Sometimes, it's okay to be totally full of shit. As Alpha male character J.R. Ewing said in *Dallas:* [""Never tell the truth when a good lie will do.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-Bb7rYPuEw)",41,1
Reflections on War Bride dynamic and how to act with that knowledge,[removed],2,1
Pussy is a Commodity. Dick isn't.,"Just like the title says.  In case you worthless dicks (pun intended) forget.

Females who game the dating strategy are very self-aware of this.  

Most Men tend to forget that pussy is a Commodity. They instead view it as a prize. A prize to be rewarded once you satisfy ""her needs"". (Marriage, pay for dinner, buy her a jewelry,  etc). 

That's definitely not the case. That's not even the right fucking currency for pussy.  Being a Male with high sexual value is all the money you need. 

So invest in your fucking self. 

A high value man basically has the means to buy a get-da-pussy (GDP) pass only while he remains a high value man. 

You want to remain a platinum pass holder. You achieve this by investing in yourself.

Those lucky men who have really high value, can usually buy multiple passes.  

This is what you should strive for. Be the man that can purchase many GDP passes because of your high SMV, and toss them mofos out when they're of no use anymore.  

Don't use your real money trying to get pussy. There are no returns on that investment. It's a guaranteed loss. Play the lottery instead, at least you MIGHT fucking win big there. 

So invest in yourselves. Get 2 hobbies, a cool one that you enjoy and would be happy share with people, and one that you enjoy by yourself. There's nothing better than meditation in solitude while you work on something your heart enjoys. Aside from getting pussy that is.",61,1

* Why is having a strong frame and congruence so attractive?
* Few men have a strong frame, especially in the modern era.
* Frame strength is a personal quality that is earned, not given.

###**Characteristics of weak frame:**  
* Supplicative  
* Outcome dependent  
* Overly reactive and neurotic  
* Emotionally dependent on others  
* Soft personalities that shift and ""fill the container"" of whomever has the

* Uncomfortable wielding power, making decisions, or making commitments
low ego control; focused on image and appearance to others rather than substance

###**Indicators of a strong frame:**  
* Speaking with conviction  
* High degree of ego mastery  
* Comfortable with having power, making decisions, taking leadership and risks  
* Provoking excitement/joy in others  
* Pursuing their mission  
* Giving benevolently  
* Living with abundance  
* Not keeping score in social interactions

###**How bad frame happens**  
* Beta socialization  
* Also involves its own stages, starts at an early age

###**Stages of developing frame - man_in_the_world**  
* Phase One: Discovering your worldview
* Phase Two: Expressing your own frame
* Phase Three: Projecting your frame onto the world

###**Misconceptions about frame**  
* Many people believe frame is a mask that you put on to appear as an alpha
* Strong frame develops through deep internalization of various elements
* Good time to plug the Way of the Superior Male/book of Pook - 
* The masculine grows through challenge, masculine polarity attracts the feminine.

###**Elements - from strategos_autokrator**  
* Intellectual  
* Stoicism - always have a love of your own fate. *Not* the only successful frame type though.
* Rational egoism. Absolute certainty. Being certain of your reality is really the only thing required for a strong frame -James
* Emotional. Expressing your emotions like a man - man_in_the_world
* Physical. You cannot fake this. The iron doesn't lie.  
* Accept and control your sexuality.

###**Prerequisites to Frame**   
* Outcome independence  
   For important things, the outcome generally matters  
   It's possible to remain independent but have a preference.   
   Have Plan A, Plan B, Plan C  
   Understand that no plan survives contact with the enemy   
   The purpose of the plan is not the plan.   
* abundance mentality  
* Discipline and work ethic  
   ""Experience trumps affirmations""    
   Gaining competence in reality only comes through experience which is why it takes much time to create a strong frame    
   Part of having the ultimate frame is knowing at your core that you are competent at these things, which can only come from external validation through positive outcomes  
   Healthy validation seeking versus unhealthy validation seeking  
   One serves your mission and one does not

###**Tactics of Frame Construction**  
* Taking inventory of your own weaknesses and coming up with a plan to address them. (Athol Kay - Mindful Attraction Plan)  
* Kill your validation seeking behavior. - (NMMNG Breaking Free Exercises)  
* Learn how to reset everyday and choose to be positive. (-johneyapocalypse/The Feeling Good Handbook)  
* Self-introspection: getting to know yourself. (Stoicism)  
* Overcome your fears and moving outside of your comfort zone.  
* Recognizing adversity and failure as an opportunity for growth.  
* Learn how to accept that which you cannot control. (WISNIFG)  
* Approaching women as a potential experience rather than out of a need for sex and validation.",12,1

Self-Improvement is a Lifelong Endeavour,"Is there an endpoint to self-improvement?

Many guys start improving themselves, assuming if they achieve their goals it‚Äôll fix all their insecurities and solve all their problems.

* ‚ÄúIf I could just get laid consistently, I‚Äôd be happy.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIf I was strong and buff, I‚Äôd be happy.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIf I made enough money to pay all my bills and buy any toys I want, I‚Äôd be happy.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIf I \_\_\_\_\_, I‚Äôd be happy.‚Äù

The problem with putting the focus and importance on the goal (and not the journey) is you‚Äôre defining an endpoint. You‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a certain point you can get to where you‚Äôll be happy and satisfied and won‚Äôt need to keep busting your ass with self-improvement.

The truth is **you should never want to relax and stop improving.** If you‚Äôre not improving, you‚Äôre atrophying.

In life, you‚Äôre either on an upwards trajectory (towards your goals), or a downwards trajectory (away from your goals). There is no in-between. If you think you‚Äôre ‚Äútreading water‚Äù and staying still, you‚Äôre really moving away from your goals. Success doesn‚Äôt come from staying still.

A concept you‚Äôll often hear from many guys (and a tonne of girls) is, ‚ÄúI want a partner who loves me for me‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have to keep pushing myself, always putting up a front and trying to be strong.‚Äù They‚Äôre complaining about having to improve themselves and actually make an effort to achieve the things they want to achieve. ‚Äú[It seems like a lot of work](https://killyourinnerloser.com/i-cant-get-laid/#i-cant-get-laid-because-its-too-hard)‚Ä¶‚Äù

So what, you want to give up completely, be a little pussy and sit around playing video games, being complacent, just ‚Äúexisting‚Äù?

**Existing = sitting around just waiting to die.**

Truth is you should be working on bettering yourself every day anyway; *it should be a core part of who you are.* It‚Äôs a core part of masculinity, and a key piece of the *happiness puzzle*.

The day you feel like a completed product in one area of your life is the day you move on to the next area that needs handling. If you‚Äôre finally able to get laid consistently with hot chicks whenever you want, then it‚Äôs time to move on and start killing it with money/career. If you finally hit that gym goal you‚Äôve been working on for 5 years, then it‚Äôs time to set the next goal. If your business finally makes 100k, then it‚Äôs time to work towards 200k.

You‚Äôll never ever be satisfied with who you are as a person or where you are in life. *You‚Äôre not supposed to be.* You should definitely **be happy and proud of your achievements;** but that‚Äôs not the same thing as *satisfied.* Satisfied implies there‚Äôs no more work to be done, no more improvements to be made, nothing else to get better at. There will *always* be more to improve. You will never be perfect or complete.

**Self-improvement is an in-tray that never gets emptied.**

Once you get a taste for working on goals, pushing yourself, working on your mission, *achieving big things* ‚Äì you‚Äôll never want to stop. You‚Äôll always want *more*.

And that‚Äôs a good thing. You‚Äôll never, ever, ever, ever be bored. You‚Äôll never, ever, ever be directionless. You‚Äôll always know what it is you need to do, and where it is you want to go. You‚Äôll have a sense of confidence &amp; self-knowledge most people could never even dream of. You‚Äôll know who you are, and who you‚Äôre going to be in 1 year‚Äôs time.

**Eventually you‚Äôll be satisfied with always being a little dissatisfied.**",60,1

Hypergamy Is Very Important To Understand In 2020,"Hey Everyone,

If you have been on this sub for a long time, then you know that hypergamy is something that both men and women face in the sexual marketplace. The definition google gives us of hypergamy is, ""The action of marrying a person of a superior caste or class."" Most men have understood that a woman is hypergamous but have not taken into consideration, that a man can be hypergamous as well.

We men can practice hypergamy is so many ways. We can go to the gym to build our bodies. We can acquire more skills to give us access to higher income jobs. We have the ability to choose better living conditions that will place us around individuals with higher thought processes. There are many options available for a man that wants to become his best.  Women are born inherently with their beauty giving them a massive advantage. They do not need to work as hard as a man does in the self improvement space. 

Instead of creating complaints, one must make a choice to improve. Improving yourself takes a long time, and there will be a lot of times where you struggle. I was 240 pounds three years ago when I was looking at this sub. My confidence was low and women did not have an underlying respect for me. It wasn\`t until I accepted that I am 100% in control of myself that I decided to turn everything around. I now have much more opportunities to make the choice in the women I want because more are choosing. 

It is 2020 and everything in the world has been up and down. That means it is the perfect time to begin improving yourself during the storm. By taking more action towards your goals and improving yourself you will project a different person. That new ego will eventually be able to take on the world in a very different manner.

The Individual .vs. The Collective,"As Civilization ever expands and increases, the more the individual has to sacrifice for the collective.

Society is operated by systems. These systems mostly do not benefit the individual. Only benefit the collective.

A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link. This applies to america.

And oh boy look at america.

Individualism is discourage in society. Rightfully so, slaves help start-up any great civilization.

Why lose that?

History says ""If it ain't broke don't fix it""

But how did society start?

**Society started in tribes:**

In the book *Plumes and arrows by Colin Simpson,* is study's of the many tribes inside New Guinea (an island in the southern hemisphere). A thing to note is how vastly different each tribe was. One tribe would not have ""Mother"" or ""father"" roles, the whole tribe would work together to raise the children.

Another, believed women as evil (witches) and had it be disgraceful to be in the presence of women. Point is, These tribes were arbitrary. At first there were only a handful of tribes. However as time moved on members of the early tribes left and started their own.

Thing being, morals were invented for each tribe. Same thing applies with modern civilization, it's fellow countries and Blue-pills.

*TRP is amoral.*

**Modern-Day Tribes:**

In order, the societal tribe hierarchy goes: Individual, partner, group, tribe, community, and then civilization.

Today tribes have evolved into community's.

Today's popular community's are: The LGBTQ, the manosphere, the left, the right, BLM, and gamer's

Many community's are connected via. social media platforms. Less personal interaction takes place.

The modern individual feels apart of the group however they are ""disconnected"" ironically from their matter-state. They exist within a hyper-reality where real social interaction is perverted. Where they don't see others as people but as ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù

**Matter-state:**

This is my main idea. Matter-state, I use as symbolism for the body. Matter-state presents the physical reality. Not spiritually. The body and it's nervous system is what I call matter-state.

Matter-state is in opposition with Hyper-reality

In *""Modern Man in search of a soul""* (one of Jung's books) he mentions how he is more distracted and less in touch with his movements. The Archaic man, one of tribal tradition however is in touch with their nature. For they live a life of less distraction and a more natural existence. Hyper-reality can represent the brain. Too many today live within their brain and not their body. They see the world and hear however, do not feel, do not touch.... other then themselves and a screen.

Almost as if living a separate existence within their self. They're in a hyper-reality.

Society creates this hyper-reality. For the hyper-reality acts as a religion or law for the collective to follow.

Nature doesn't have federal laws. It has the food chain.

Media lies and overtime brain washes people. Marketing at its finest.

The government has become many people's source of survival. Living off the state.

Newsflash, the more one is dependent among something the less they are independent.

**Group-think:**

&gt;The practice of thinking or making decisions as a group in a way that discourages creativity or individual responsibility.

This is what's happening to society at a large scale. It is not anything new. However, as the population expands the bigger our ""group"" gets. Thus more sacrifice of the individual and less creativity.

**Security and Insecurity:**

Today's people are attached to little personal black monoliths. Many people use social media for attention and validation. Few for business. They seek security in others attention for they have deep insecurity's.

Lacking ‚Äútribe‚Äù or matter-state. They use others for attention and validation to have a quick sense of belonging, of being in a tribe, only for the feeling to leave shortly after.

A tribe provided a sense of purpose.

Now, loneliness lurks in many peoples lives.

After 9/11 we are also under constant threat for companies and governments seek to monitor us through our ‚Äúmonoliths‚Äù. Just ask Edward snowden.

Are we truly alone?

# Conclusion:

People are under deep programming or disillusionment. They're mind and body is within a cage, both separated from one another.

We live in an age of anxiety. The individual is being captured, divided and conquered. Being divided from the body and it's nature. Everyone is being depersonalized.

Society has simply turned into:

Investors &gt; educated

The mind is a powerful tool, however so is the body.

Both are used to make a human being, an individual.

One must focus on both of their connections to each region.

Taking care of their body as much as their brain.

Getting back in touch with themselves; With the physical and actual reality

Being able to understand when they are in Hyper-reality or, Matter-state.

Society's frame or natures reality

Thus allowing the individual to live a life of their own and feel things ‚Äúmatter‚Äù.",114,1

Feminism is all over the WORLD!,"Here in Saudi Arabia that which is located in the middle east,

Feminism was introduced to Saudi girls by their favorite celebrities which I believe 3-5 years ago where Feminism was all over the news and social media. Everyone at that time went to Twitter and Tweeted about how women their should speak for their rights, where several hashtags went trend and some of the celebrities, in the US mostly, actually did notice that and Tweeted to congrats them on this move. 

During this period of time women got angrier and felt like some of their rights were taken, which is wrong obviously!

Background about women rights in most of Arab countries: 

1- You cannot sleep with a girl unless you are married to her; since we are Muslims and this is a law from the Quran. Which is really fine.

2- Wives there are not mandatory to spend a dime on her family, so all the money support should come from the husband. And this a law actually at least here in Saudi Arabia.

3- When you marry a women most of the time you will have to pay to her 8-30k$ as a money to buy for her self some clothes, jewelries and wedding dress. Not to mention the wedding it self where you have to rent a place to do the wedding at which is a story on its own.

4- Women could not drive 3 years ago, so most of them had their own personal driver to take them where they want.

All of these rights about getting married and spending money on the family are fine by most of the Saudi's. Even though it would be better if getting married their was easier as it used to be 50 year ago. 

Due to these expenses most men get married when they are 28-30 years old. Usually at that age the husband and the wife are virgins, YES virgins do not be surprised. Unless he or she has been divorced.

These are their RIGHTS !!! What can they ask more !

The reason I wrote this is that the other day I got on a fight on the street with a women who did not how to drive, she where driving at night with her lights off and she was behind me and I was driving slowly enjoying my coffee where I hear a car behind honking on the horn for a straight minute. When someone does that you cannot just let him/her go with it, so I pulled my hand out of the window to tell her to stop a side the road to talk. She comes down from her car with her phone recording a video and waving it at me like its some sort of a weapon. She threatened me I will do this and that. I did not talk the whole time waiting for her to shut the fuck up and kept drinking my coffee, when she shut her mouth I told her ""Your lights are off"" she did not know that so she just went to the car not saying anything not even apologizing. After that I went to the gym with this negativity and crashed it there.

**Since when a women can** pull off the street to start a fight?

"Narcissists, BPD, and You","There is a constant stream of ""I am/emulate Dark Triad"" or ""my girlfriend was totally BPD/Narcissistic and destroyed me bro"". Chances are, you're not, and/or your oneitis wasn't. 

They're about 1.5-2% of the population. That seems small, but if you compare it to your uni/college social sphere, you probably know a few. Fun fact: Cluster B shows up much more often as socioeconomic status and education increase. 


This post will rid you of armchair psychology, and give you accurate information about the following *in the context of personal relationships*:

* Properly defining the general disorder 

* Practical, punchy tips to find and deal with these types


-----------


**Classifying**

Most iterations of these disorders fall into ""Cluster B"". Cluster B is:

&gt; characterized by dramatic, overly emotional or unpredictable thinking or behavior


Whereas Cluster A captures the ""odd and eccentric"" such as paranoid or schizo, and Cluster C captures ""anxious and fearful"" such as obsessive compulsive or avoidant/dependent, Cluster B is one of the more ""functional"" of the extreme abnormal psychologies, because those afflicted generally aren't immediately recognizable. 

Most A and C don't leave the house much, and if they do, they are generally manifestly identified, i.e. you can tell just by looking. Bs, on the other hand, are lurking unseen among us. Narcissists and Borderlines are Cluster B. 


---------------------


**Key Definitions**

* Depend on ""narcissistic supply""

Cluster B have a clear goal: fuel their own self obsession. This is termed ""narcissistic supply"" and applies to those that aren't strictly narcissists. The most important thing to understand is that they care for nothing but this supply. The rest of their words, actions, and beliefs are an act to further the supply. 

This is not posting your ass on instagram, or putting hoes before bros. Normal people can do that just fine.

Bs define and derive their ego from other's reactions to an image they present and project. He or she depends entirely on other people to determine their ""self"", but considers the sources of this fuel inferior or contemptible.

This makes a true B volatile and amorphous, but absolutely sure of themselves RIGHT NOW. 

Have you met someone completely sure of their ever changing beliefs?

* Co-idealize the partner, and depend on that co-idealization

Bs create a fantasy about you as a partner, then use that fantasy to fuel their supply. ""You are so talented/handsome/social/strong"" is a vessel for the reflexive thought of ""what does that mean for me?"" The only answer to this fantasy is that the B must also be equally incredible, if not greater for finding you.

Keep in mind, this co-idealization is not purely romantic. Bs also carry this out in friendships and acquaintances. 

This shared fantasy must be perfect, as they cannot exist without it. The fantasy must be perfect for the Narc/B herself, and you must be a perfect participant. This does not mean a Narc cannot survive conflict, they simply dissociate from the conflict, should you be willing to propagate the fantasy. 

Have you ever had a fight that was ""over"" without real resolution? 

* Possess a dual reality, with a partial self awareness. 


This is the most important part. True Cluster Bs do not experience regular emotion. They feel INTENSE emotion. Bs are VOLATILE, though some in different ways (detailed in bullets below). They also have an internal database for ""how people behave"". 


If a Narc/BPD (""N/B"") is smiling right now, they have accessed the ""how do people look when happy"" database and acted accordingly. This is her or his **reality** database. Lived experiences exist in a specific, compartmentalized place in the Narc's mind. They are tools to ""fit in"" or use you.

The N/B also lives and breathes a fantasy. The N/B creates a Disneyland that you both live in - their fantasy and reality, for the most part, coexist without the N/B's awareness. Any awareness of the conflict between fantasy and reality is an attack. It is deeply unsettling for a Cluster B to be presented with their fantasy *as a fantasy*. Any devaluation of the fantasy is a devaluation of the B herself/himself. You shit on their work of art, essentially. 


Cluster Bs are essentially in a constant post-traumatic state, gilded with grandiosity. If you interfere with their idealization of you, or their internal fantasy, you are now reduced to an object to be either controlled again or destroyed. Neither is good. 


------------------


**Practical Advice**


* All Cluster Bs have their own unique disorder

This is especially true of Borderlines. Narcs and psychopathic types are generally ""classifiable"". Regardless, it is a waste of time to define why your particular crazy person is crazy. ID the crazy and act accordingly (that's usually ""get the fuck out"").


* Narcs have an ""Island of Stability"" (kudos Sam Vaknin)

Narcissists possess most of the above characteristics, but pick one thing that is rock solid. Male Narcs usually pick things that can be ""shown off"" externally, e.g. careers, money, or appearance. Female Narcs tend to pick things that are an ""extension of themselves"" (if not their own body) such as social circles, close friends, or children. 

Regardless, what defines a NARCISSIST is their island of stability, while Borderlines and actual psychos are pure chaos.

* Praise and co-idealization are different

We should all seek a partner that notices and makes us aware of our ""good parts"". The important aspect is recognizing where this behavior is designed to control. If someone is telling you are hot, cool, or successful, that's not immediately an issue. If you sense they're doing it *because their association with you* is why they are saying it, take a closer look.

* Borderlines are amorphous, but identifiable

Most Borderlines are women, most true Narcs men. No Borderline is identical. Borderlines are identifiable from their ""metamorphosis"" between a number of Cluster Bs and personalities. The change is sudden and distinct. What defines a Borderline is *their sudden, complete lack of self awareness* while they shapeshift. A Borderline will exhibit neurotypical, narcissistic, psychopathic, sadistic, et al. What makes them Borderline is their sudden and unaware change.


----------------------------


**Conclusion**


Having coached a lot of guys through some disordered bitches, I can tell you that sometimes the problem was said guy. The goal of this post is to technically detail who is what and how to identify. 

Personally, I'm fine fucking crazy - as long as I know what kind of crazy I am fucking. Crazy can be fun, a mechanical bull some unseen force is controlling, but always a fun run if you know what you're getting into and can dismount without getting hurt.

A Note on OPSEC in light of the recent Twitter leaks...,"For those not already in the know, you should be aware that:

* The admins of major websites (Twitter, Discord, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, etc.) all have complete access to your information.
* Your IP, Email, Phone, etc is visible to even low-level employees tasked with moderating.
* Your ""private"" messages are 100% visible to all admin.
* There is likely no policy in place to prevent disgruntled employees from accessing your account if they want. (example: Low level employee deleted Trump's twitter)
* Major doxxings are done by looking at private information and then using parallel construction with public facing details to make a *plausible* doxxing story.
* Assume anything you write on social media is read by others and will be leaked if it is advantageous to do so.

Some industries had to set up audit trails to prevent misusing information (for instance, pharmacy employees looking up famous names).

This does not apply in tech. There is no law. The only privacy you can achieve is the privacy that you implement.

Using the same browser for personal browsing and private browsing allows websites and advertising networks to fingerprint you and they will know you are the same person.

Cross contamination only requires one small detail to get through. Facebook on your phone monitors what wifi networks you are near and determines your location and possible friends based on this, regardless if you log in / out / have a burner phone / turn off gps.

Different browsers on the same computer may still leak enough information to make connections.

VPNs only disguise your IP/Location but cannot prevent you from leaking the same information just from a different IP. 

If you log into a personal account and a burner account, reddit already knows who you are and has connected them.

Major retail stores pay large amounts of money to track you by your phone, rarely needs software installed to do it. Facebook, even logged out and never set up, is complicit and will report to home as you walk through a mall what stores you are near.

Be careful with what you put online.",237,1

In case you need to be reminded on why you shouldn't commit to a promiscuous woman.,"On recommendation, I'm posting this here. I'll minimize my own personal commentary. I've compiled and edited these golden kernels, excerpted from peer-reviewed studies, into a presentable and standalone format. When surveyed, as many as a [quarter of women](https://nypost.com/2018/07/30/americans-are-open-but-dishonest-about-their-sexual-history/) *admit* to lying about their histories, so that's the conservative estimate; some women are better chameleons than others, but their deceptiveness doesn't negate the utility of this information. There are ways of discerning that I may go into later, but let's cut to the chase:

&gt; Our findings demonstrate that infidelity and number of sexual partners are both under moderate genetic influence (41% and 38% heritable, respectively) and the genetic correlation between these two traits is strong (47%). The resulting genetic correlation between the two traits was .47, so nearly half the genes impacting on infidelity also affect number of sexual partners. The correlation of the unique environment between the two variables was .48.

&gt; A truism in psychology is that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. This is no less true in the realm of sexual behavior.

Deception about past sexual promiscuity would have inflicted greater costs, on average, on men than on women

&gt; Sexual promiscuity was significantly positively correlated with emotional promiscuity [r(356) = .261, p &lt; .001], as well with sexual infidelity [r(323) = .595, p &lt; .001] and emotional infidelity [r(323) = .676, p &lt; .001], indicating that sexually promiscuous participants also tend to be emotionally promiscuous, and sexual[ly] and emotional[ly] unfaithful. In terms of the sexual domain, results showed that there is also a positive correlation between sexual promiscuity and sexual infidelity, stating that individuals that tend to be more sexually promiscuous also tend to be more sexually unfaithful. These results support our second hypothesis.

&gt; For people in this survey who reported four or fewer lifetime sexual partners, the rate of infidelity in the current marriage dropped to 11%, while for those who had five or more sexual partners the number was nearly double (21%). The break between the 54% of people who had five or more lifetime sexual partners vs. the 46% who had four or fewer total partners illustrates the lessons from the study. This breakpoint is validated by the fact that when asked straight out, 68% of those with more sexual partners in their pasts agreed that, ‚ÄúI am always faithful to my sexual partner‚Äù (whether currently married or single), compared to 82% of those with fewer sexual partners who said the same.
 
&gt; [I]nfidelity is also often the fruit of a lifelong approach to mating that involves seeking and practicing short-term mating encounters that encourage sexual variety at all stages and into marriage.

[Masculinity Amidst Madness] The Stoic Mindset (a love of fate),"**The first post in my dissection of [MASCULINITY AMIDST MADNESS](https://amzn.to/30ongwZ) by Ryan Landry (The New American Sun, formerly Social Matter and the Weimerica Weekly podcast). For this post, we'll be looking at Chapter 01 and why the true masculine mindset is the STOIC MINDSET.**
___

In the first chapter of ""MASCULINITY AMIDST MADNESS,"" Landry sets the ground work for the masculine mindset- seek truth, be strong, and have a stoic mindset: **""The person one presents should be the man of order among the chaos of children""** (01). Children represent chaos, men represent order. [if you're interested in looking at the order vs chaos dynamic, in a larger historical sense, I wrote an [essay](https://medium.com/@KillToParty/what-is-the-dark-enlightenment-e1aad674abaf) on that].

**When we think of order, we think of truth and justice- we think of noble pursuits and making good use of our time- and we think of *rational thought prevailing over emotion*.** 

Think of rational thought as reality and emotion as a kind of drug-induced anti-reality. Not that emotions can't be useful, maybe *leading you* to positive action, or an eventual clarity of thought, but reacting based on pure emotion alone will typically lead to poor decision making. **The stoic mindset is to understand emotions as a kind of temporary, alternative-reality that can cloud proper decision making- not that you should repress them, but always understand them in that context.**

&gt; ""There should be no fear in failing and no over exuberance in succeeding. Goals can be tiered and for any realm of your life. Facing challenges will become easier as you amass wins and learn from failures"" (08)

Enjoy your success. Acknowledge what it took to become successful in any given endeavor- but the *emotion* of exuberance will only lead to over-confidence and eventual failure; one must be humble in victory to ensure future victories!

However, this idea must be taken to its logical end- it's not enough to be unswayed by temporary emotions but to **always have a love of your own fate- this is the basic tenant of the STOIC MINDSET.**

**When I was in high school, I took a class on Improvisational Acting (or, you know, ""improv"") where I had two key take-aways**- 1) improv absolutely sucks and is the worst kind of hack comedy (a banana, a children's hospital and OJ Simpson! Go! *eye roll*), and 2) one of the games we practiced, called ""best friends,"" meant to sharpen our ability to do awful comedy, actually functioned as a simple microcosm for how to live your life. 

Incredible that this was probably the single best lesson I learned in all of high school!

You played ""best friends"" by grabbing a partner and improvising a story together, where you'd each trade off every few lines... the only catch was, you needed to *keep the story moving forward,* you could never look back and contradict what your ""best friend"" said- in other words, you need to *always go with the flow.* So if you start a story grounded in reality about a guy working at McDonald's and your partner introduces space aliens, suddenly you're telling a sci-fi story.

In short, this is the STOIC MINDSET in action. No matter what happens, you move forward. You must have a love of your own fate. **Everything, even the worst hardships, aren't happening to you- they're *happening for you*.** You allow the resulting emotion to pass, look at where your pieces ended up falling on the metaphorical board, and plot your next moves from there. 

**The stoic will understand that nothing is owned- everything is borrowed and must eventually be returned.** You love your pet, but eventually, you will have to return them to the Earth. Your relationship ended, the love she had for you faded- but it was always temporary. Your parents dying will hurt the most- but this is a chance to become stronger, reflect on your life and goals, and learn more about yourself. 

**Everything is borrowed- you must love your fate and move forward, always.**

Robert Greene referred to this as ""the hustler's flow"" in his criminally underrated ""[The 50th Law](https://amzn.to/3fM9Ot9)."" 50 Cent had to learn this lesson to become a successful street hustler- you cannot look back, you cannot allow emotion to cloud rational decision making, and you must always deal with the reality of your present.

Even if your reality sucks, the only way to make the most of it is to embrace it, use it, and plot your next moves because no amount of losing yourself in emotion can change the reality you were blessed with!

Stoicism must be the foundation of the masculine mindset!

True story.,,2,1
The time that I could have gotten me too‚Äôd,"TL;DR I ended up on the phone with the national suicide hotline one night over an incident that occurred between a woman and myself in a hotel room. 2 - 3 weeks later the ‚Äúme too‚Äù movement blew up and Harvey Weinstein was all over the news. This made me afraid that she would make false accusations against me and I‚Äôd be known as some kind of local Harvey Weinstein. Finding the TRP community helped me get over it because it answered a lot of questions for me surrounding that situation. 

So for anyone interested this is what happened. Back when I was blue-pilled and very beta they hired an attractive young woman at my work. Let‚Äôs call her Nora. I asked her if she‚Äôd like to go out with me sometime. She said yes and even thanked me for asking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you asked. I was hoping someone cool would ask me to do something sometime. My social life has been kind of dead for a while.‚Äù Then she hugged me. The next day she treated me like I didn‚Äôt exist. Something just changed over night. She started clinging to a guy that got hired the same day that she did. I was interested in another woman at work too so I pursued that instead. I even hooked up with that other woman one night shortly after. I decided not to pursue anything with Nora going forward. 

However, as time went on I got to know Nora better and we grew kind of close as friends. I decided that I would like to revisit the idea of pursuing romance with her and so I confessed to her that I had feelings for her. She replied by telling me that she didn‚Äôt feel the same way but she loved me as a friend. So I let it go. Then she went on to be extra nice to me after that. I‚Äôd never gotten so much attention from her and now she was being all ‚Äúextra‚Äù with me. This became very irritating and my natural proclivity  was to completely withdraw all of my attention from her. This made her even more ‚Äúextra‚Äù with me because all of a sudden I‚Äôm the only guy that she‚Äôs not getting attention from. Then if I started getting attention from any of the other attractive young ladies she would try to ruin it. I literally had a hott young chick run down a hall way and jump on me, embracing me in a hug and wouldn‚Äôt let go. So Nora walked up and started to talk to me about work related things. Everything that Nora said was stuff she knew that I already knew though. It was an unnecessary conversation. Nora was just mad that my attention to her stopped and I was getting extra attention from another pretty, young woman.

It gets worse. There was a supervisor and there was also a manager that were blatantly, obviously attracted to Nora. It was so bad that the workers all had jokes about it and we‚Äôd talk about it often. There was a guy at work named Bob who was on our crew and he also had a crush on her. He was married with kids. I don‚Äôt know what happened exactly between Nora and Bob but Bob‚Äôs wife found incriminating texts from Nora on his phone and Bob ended up getting divorced. Then it turns out Nora slept with that Supervisor I mentioned earlier. Someone at work claims to have busted them in some room but he didn‚Äôt report them or anything he just gossiped to us about it. I also know because she confided in a co-worker who confided in me. 

Anyway, there was another attractive young lady at our work, let‚Äôs call her Leah, who looked a lot like Nora. They could‚Äôve been sisters. Leah and I had grown pretty close as friends. So one day I‚Äôm out at the smoking area outside having a smoke with Leah when Nora comes up. And I‚Äôm totally ignoring Nora. Then out of nowhere Nora asks me out to the Green Day concert. I didn‚Äôt even answer her. I literally just left. 

About a week later a group of us had left work for lunch. I forgot my wallet in my work locker so when we got to the restaurant I had to ask someone to cover my tab. Nora was among us and she actually volunteered to do it. I accepted because I didn‚Äôt really have another choice. And I told her that tomorrow I would buy her lunch to reciprocate the favor. She accepted. 

So the next day we went to lunch together in my car and it was awkward and I knew that it would be. I didn‚Äôt wanna have awkward conversation so what I did was I told her that I wanted to show her a band. So I pulled up some music vids of that band on my phone and played the music through my car speakers. This kept her occupied and made our food run much less awkward. 

About a week later It was announced that Nora was getting a promotion. She would now be above me on the corporate latter. That same day I came home from work and had a few drinks before bed. I lied down as I got ready to fall asleep when Nora texted me. She wanted to know the name of the band that I had her check out that day on my phone. During this text exchange, while under the influence of alcohol, I told her that I‚Äôd go see Green Day with her if she‚Äôd go see a Metal show with me next week. Guess what. She accepted. When I woke up sober I was kicking myself. I regretted my drunk actions. 

I‚Äôve asked women out before and they‚Äôve told me yes only to blow me off when it came down to it. Nora accepted an invitation from me before and treated me like I didn‚Äôt exist the next day. Hey, with any luck maybe she‚Äôd do it again? Oh contrare, mofrare! Two days before the Metal show that I wanted to go see Nora texted me to ask if we were still on for that concert. I told her that I was having second thoughts and used the location of the venue as my excuse. Then I told her where the concert would be held. This was her exact text to me. 

‚ÄúGeez, that is far! But anything is possible if you really wanna se me.‚Äù 

This made me feel like she was interested in me now and so my little head started doing a lot of thinking. So I went ahead and bought our tickets. The two tix costed me $300 but they were really good seats. I went to her house to pick her up the night of the concert and we went off to see our show. Remember how I mentioned that there was a manager who also had a crush on her? Well he was her direct boss now. Due to the fact that she wanted to leave work early to go to the concert with me she asked him if she could leave and make up her hours next week. He was resistant at first but she persisted and he eventually folded after giving  her a lecture about how she can‚Äôt just make up her hours anymore. So she really put effort into seeing that concert with me. She didn‚Äôt even know the bands that we were going to go see. 

Eventually we got to the concert. A few songs into the opening band‚Äôs set she held my hand. We even held each other at the waist with one arm, side by side, swaying to the beat during a power love ballad. Unfortunately, we both got wasted at the show. We were way too caught up in the moment while the drinks were flowing. But she even bought me a couple of drinks and of course I bought some for her too. I bought most of the drinks but she did buy me some though. Anyway, after the show there was a moment that felt right that lead to me kissing her. She even kissed me back. We kept drinking though and eventually the bar tenders refused to serve us any more. 

So the night should have been over right there but fate would not be so merciful to me. I told her that I was too drunk to drive us home. There was a hotel nearby. I offered to pay for an Uber or she could stay with me. She agreed to stay with me in the hotel room. So we‚Äôre in the hotel room and our room had two queen size beds. We were on one bed making out and I was getting real handsy and she was going along with it. Then out of nowhere she pushed me away and yelled ‚Äúget off of me!!!‚Äù So I asked her what was wrong and she said that I was a bad kisser. I‚Äôm not used to being told that. The woman I mentioned hooking up with at the beginning of the story unsolicitedly told me I was a good kisser. So I told Nora let‚Äôs try again and show me how you like it. So she showed me and I just had my mouth open and did absolutely nothing with my tongue whatsoever and she said, ‚Äúmmmmm.‚Äù She liked me not doing anything whatsoever. I guess she wanted to do all the work? So we went at it again and I decided that this time I would try bare minimum tongue in this kiss. So I did. And that pissed her off!!! ‚ÄúDamn it! You did it again. That‚Äôs it! I‚Äôm done. It‚Äôs over.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt want it to end though so I asked her what was wrong and tried to reason with her. I told her that I‚Äôve liked her romantically for a long time and I was hurt by her past rejections. I told her that the night was going so well and that we both had a good time and lately she was giving me the impression that she was becoming interested in me. This is where it gets ugly. She bent over the desk and started shaking her ass at me. 

HER: ‚ÄúDo you want it?‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúYes, of course!‚Äù
Her: ‚ÄúHow bad do you want it?‚Äù
Me: I want it badly.
Her: ‚ÄúWhat would you do for it?‚Äù 
Me: ‚ÄúAnything.‚Äù
Her: ‚ÄúWhat should I make you do for it?‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do anything.‚Äù
Her: **starts giggling** ‚Äúgee, I can‚Äôt think of anything that I want from you.‚Äù

In this moment a memory flashed in my mind. My dad once told me ‚Äúnever beg‚Äù and it occurred to me that that‚Äôs exactly what I was doing. Then I realized that she was playing a really f-ed up game with me by making me beg only to deny me. Then I got mad and I told her how messed up she was to do this and that I was even madder because I had been going out of my way to stay away from her ever since she rejected me in the past and that she‚Äôd been going out of her way lately to get my attention. And I asked her if that‚Äôs what this was, just her needing attention? This question got her MAD!!! She blew up at me. Then she said some mean things and some weird things.

Her: ‚ÄúYou are a subordinate. (Because now she‚Äôs 1.5 steps above me on the corporate latter making $3K -4K a year more than me) and I don‚Äôt want your juices, your bodily fluids, for mating and procreation.‚Äù

I was kind of like WTF?!? Who talks like that. Why is she trying to talk like she‚Äôs smarter than what she is? She was very pretty but not very smart. But I can‚Äôt escape the fact that what she said still hurt. My heart stopped and I‚Äôm sure that was reflected on my face but she just looked at me with a cold, blank stare. She sat down and lit up a smoke. (One of mine because she ran out of hers.) I sat down on one of the beds all sulky with my back facing her and she said something that just got under my skin worse than anything else she said that night. 

Her: ‚ÄúWhat? You‚Äôre just gonna ignore me and sit there and pout for the rest of the night?‚Äù

I‚Äôm sure you can understand why this pissed me off. She lead me on for almost two weeks. She shuts me down in bed while there was all this steam going on between us. She said some mean things, flaunted her posterior at me and compelled me to beg for it. Now she‚Äôs gonna call me out for pouting after she made me feel like sh!t? So I got up and I did something that I really regret doing. If I could take it back I would but it was in the heat of the moment and it was a crime of passion. I walked over to where she was sitting and I said everything I wrote a few sentences ago about everything she did to lead up to this. This was the regretted action that I took in the heat of that moment. I said ‚ÄúYou know what? Forget you!‚Äù And I pushed her head with the tips of my fingers.

It wasn‚Äôt excessively hard. It certainly didn‚Äôt leave any marks or hurt her. I doubt she even felt it a minute later but I knew in that moment that I f-ed up! 

You see, what she did to me that night was mean, nasty and awful but it certainly was NOT violent. My reaction to what she did to me was violent though. That little head push was a violation of the NAP (non-aggression principle.) The NAP states that all violent threats are death threats because violence taken to the logical extreme leads to death. As drunk as she was she could have fallen out of her chair and hit her head on the corner of a nearby desk and possibly died. What she did to me did not deserve a death penalty. 

Her: ‚ÄúDid you just push me? You did! You put your hands on me.‚Äù 

Then she got up and started screaming, throwing things across the room and shoving me around. So I knew that I messed up and now she‚Äôs making so much noise and screaming that I was certain someone in a nearby room would call security.  As she started shoving me around I kept my guard down and let her get her shoves in and tried to convey that I‚Äôm not going to be a threat moving forward. When she shoved me for the last time she said...

Her: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever put your hands on me again!‚Äù
Me: ‚Äúok, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

She went to lay down on one bed and I sat down on the other. I was certain that hotel security were on their way up. I pulled out my phone and I started to write down details from the evening in my notes app so that I could remember things when I sobered up. Then the fear of false accusations entered my mind. So I texted my mom and a few friends letting them know that I was in a hotel room with Nora and we were both wasted and an incident occurred and I was now worried that false accusations would follow. I was aware of the ‚ÄúMatress Girl‚Äù incident at that time. This was just an attempt to secure an alibi and leave a digital time stamp incase false accusations did occur. 

I then continued to write down details from the evening in my phone. As I was writing in my phone she was lying in the other bed muttering unintelligible things and laughing to herself. One of the things I wrote down was ‚Äúapparently she‚Äôs not attracted to me. Well then, I guess she should invite a guy who she is attracted to to go see Green Day.‚Äù Eventually enough time passed and security hadn‚Äôt come to our door leaving me confident that they just weren‚Äôt gonna come at all. Then I stood up and said ‚Äúlook, I have two things I wanna say before I go to bed. First, incase you may be planning on making false allegations against me I just want you to know that I texted my mom and some of my friends and I told them where I am and who I‚Äôm with. Second, you can find someone else to go see Green Day with you!‚Äù

Her: ‚ÄúWhat!?! You told your mom? And you‚Äôre not going to Green Day?‚Äù Then she started crying. That made me feel a sense of petty satisfaction. I then turned out the light and crawled into the other bed. She then got up and grabbed her purse before storming out of the room. I eventually woke up and for a second I didn‚Äôt know where I was. I looked down at my phone and I had text messages from my mom and my friends expressing concern and advising me to go sleep in my car or the hotel lobby. I looked around and Nora was gone and the room was trashed. I wasn‚Äôt sure if Nora was coming back. Maybe she went to one of the concession stands in the morning and she was gonna come back for a ride home? So I texted her and told her ‚ÄúI have to check out by noon. Not sure where you‚Äôre at. Let me know if you‚Äôre coming back so I can check out before then if you found another way home.‚Äù I waited till 11:55 and finally checked out. Several hours later I got a text from her saying, ‚Äúsorry for leaving like that last night. I do that when I‚Äôm drunk. But I want you to know that I did have a good time.‚Äù I did not reply to the text.

I felt so awful in the aftermath of that night that a few nights later I ended up on the phone with the national suicide hotline. The counselor told me that due to the fact that there was so much alcohol involved that night I should just talk to her. I took the counselor‚Äôs advice and texted her and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for my part in what happened that night. I‚Äôd like to talk to you face to face about it. Would you be willing to meet tomorrow after work?‚Äù She replied and agreed. She proposed that we meet at a park near work at 10 pm. So we met and I explained that my desire to have something romantic with her after I confessed my feelings that one time never went away. I would treat her like a queen and spoil her like a princess (stupid, I know!) She in turn apologized for not having reciprocal feelings. I told her that I will accept that but I was not capable of being just her friend because I couldn‚Äôt just dispose of my other feelings for her. I also told her last time we had this conversation she was just way too friendly with me afterwards and I felt like her extra friendliness was just rubbing the rejection in. She apologized and promised not to do that this time. Then we parted ways.

A few weeks later the ‚Äúme too‚Äù movement and Harvey Weinstein made the news. The hotel room part of the story hit a little too close to home for me. I know that I did do one thing objectively wrong in the hotel room that night but it wasn‚Äôt rape nor was it sexual assault. It was violent assault but it wasn‚Äôt sexual assault. The fear of a false accusation resurfaced and one night at work I suffered a massive panic attack and had to leave. These panic attacks kept reoccurring so I went to see a doctor and I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder. 

About 8 months later I discovered the Red Pill community on YouTube. The knowledge shared in the community offered revelations that cured the depression that I was carrying over my lack of success with women and pushed me into self-improvement modes. I‚Äôm doing a lot better and my GAD really improved. 

It‚Äôs been a few years and I‚Äôm doing much better. I changed political parties and learned about the NAP and embraced it as one of my core values. She and I can even talk if circumstance demands it and even be civil. Her promotion was a desk job position though and she ended up gaining a bunch of weight in part because she goes home every night and drinks beer in excess. Many of the male supervisors and managers that were so crazy for her got demoted or relocated to other departments and she stopped getting preferential treatment at work. She actually went on a business trip with some other co-workers and her drinking lead to her making a complete and utter @$$ of herself on that trip. Word got around and her name was removed from the conversation for further promotions. She recently switched departments and no longer works at the same building as me. With my new found knowledge and outlook in life I‚Äôve forgiven both of us to a certain extent.",51,1

Owning nothing; Owned by no one,"In the 21st consumerist high-debt civilization called the united states,                                        committing to anything will trap you.

"Narcissists, Psychopaths, &amp; Manipulators Are More Likely To Engage In ""Virtuous Victim Signaling"", Study Finds","I came across this article and was a bit blown away... it seems to accurately describe the prevalence of white women at Black Lives Matter movements.

New study links virtue signaling to ""Dark Triad"" traits. Being accused of ""virtue signaling"" might sound nice to the uninitiated, but spend much time on social media and you know that it's actually an accusation of insincerity. Virtue signalers are, essentially, phonies and showoffs‚Äîfolks who adopt opinions and postures solely to garner praise and sympathy or whose good deeds are tainted by their need for everyone to see just how good they are. Combined with a culture that says only victimhood confers a right to comment on certain issues, it's a big factor in online pile-ons and one that certainly contributes to social media platforms being such a bummer sometimes.

So: Here's some fun new research looking at ""the consequences and predictors of emitting signals of victimhood and virtue,"" published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. The paper‚Äîfrom University of British Columbia researchers Ekin Ok, Yi Qian, Brendan Strejcek, and Karl Aquino‚Äîdetails multiple studies the authors conducted on the subject.

Their conclusion? *Psychopathic, manipulative, and narcissistic people are more frequent signalers of ""virtuous victimhood.""*

The so-called ""dark triad"" personality traits‚ÄîMachiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy‚Äîlead to characteristics like ""self-promotion, emotional callousness, duplicity, and tendency to take advantage of others,"" the paper explains.

And ""treated as a composite, the Dark Triad traits were significant predictors of virtuous victim signaling.""

This held true ""even when controlling for factors that may make people vulnerable to being mistreated or disadvantaged in society (i.e., demographic and socioeconomic characteristics) as well as the importance they place on being a virtuous individual as part of their self-concept,"" the researchers note.

*They point out that virtue signaling is defined as ""the conspicuous expression of moral values, done primarily with the intent of enhancing one's standing within a social group.""*

Meanwhile, victim signaling ""may be used as a social influence tactic that can motivate recipients of the signal to voluntarily transfer resources to the signaler,"" they explain. More from the paper's theoretical background section:

An emerging literature on competitive victimhood documents the prevalence of victim signaling by various social groups and provides evidence for its functionality as a resource extraction strategy. For instance, victim signaling justifies victim groups seeking retribution against alleged oppressors. Retribution often takes the form of demanding compensation through some kind of resource transfer from nonvictims to the alleged victim. Claiming victim status can also facilitate resource transfer by conferring moral immunity upon the claimant. Moral immunity shields the alleged victim from criticism about the means they might use to satisfy their demands. In other words, victim status can morally justify the use of deceit, intimidation, or even violence by alleged victims to achieve their goals. Relatedly, claiming victim status can lead observers to hold a person less blameworthy, excusing transgressions, such as the appropriation of private property or the infliction of pain upon others, that might otherwise bring condemnation or rebuke. Finally, claiming victim status elevates the claimant's psychological standing, defined as a subjective sense of legitimacy or entitlement to speak up. A person who has the psychological standing can reject or ignore any objections by nonvictims to the unreasonableness of their demands. In contrast to victim signalers, people who do not publicly disclose their misfortune or disadvantage are less likely to reap the benefits of retributive compensation, moral immunity, deflection of blame, or psychological standing and would therefore find it difficult to initiate resource transfers.

The effectiveness of victim signaling as a resource transfer strategy follows the basic principles of signaling theory. Signaling theory posits that the transmission of information from one individual (the sender) to another (the receiver) can influence the behavior of the receiver. Signals can refer to any physical or behavioral trait of the sender, and are used by the senders to alter the behaviors of others to their own advantage.

Their results suggest that:

""a perceived victim signal can lead others to transfer resources to a victim, but that the motivation to do so is amplified when the victim signal is paired with a virtue signal"" and ""people high in the Dark Triad traits emit the dual signal more frequently.""
""a positive correlation between the Dark Triad scores and the frequency of emitting the virtuous victim signal.""
""evidence of how these signals ‚Ä¶ can predict a person's willingness to engage in and endorse ethically questionable behaviors ‚Ä¶. frequent virtuous victim signalers are more willing to purchase counterfeit products and judge counterfeiters as less immoral compared with less frequent signalers, a pattern that was also observed when using participants' Dark Triad scores instead of their signaling score,"" and ""frequent virtuous victim signalers were more likely to cheat and lie to earn extra monetary reward in [a] coin flip game.""
""that a dimension referred to as amoral manipulation was the most reliable predictor of virtuous victim signaling.""
""frequent virtuous victim signalers were more likely to make inflated claims to justify receiving restitution for an alleged and ambiguous norm violation in an organizational context.""
The authors stress that they ""do not refute the claim that there are individuals who emit the virtuous victim signal because they experience legitimate harm and also conduct themselves in decent and laudable ways.""",56,1

"If you don't have good friends, that needs to be a serious goal before any kind of long term relationship with a woman. They can save your life.","This is the forth attempt at making a post talking about something so simple as friendship between men. Every time it went off track because I am still so angry after my recent breakup after five years.  Long story short I had great friends before her, I became depressed and anxious before and after my son was born, I expected her to care about my needs much more than I should have, and became a nervous angry wreck of a man and broke my own rules and standards of conduct.  Mental illness was a big factor looking back now. 

 I won't pretend she kept me away from them. She actually encouraged me to see my friends on numerous occasions, but I was too busy to do so, at least I thought. I tend to isolate from friends for long periods of time of depression, and felt embarrassed for my standing in life.  It was over the last year I ended up working with a guy who was probably the best friend I ever had.  We had some things in common, but a lot of differences, and we could work together for 8 hours, sometimes 13 hours if we had side jobs, and resolve conflicts, help each other out, just get along great.  I am an only child and this was when I found out what it's like to have a little brother.

 I would feed him red pills about his failed relationship and he would use them to move on.  One of my proudest achievements was being the guy he called for over 30 minutes one night when his ex wife was driving him crazy with their divorce, and helping him through that. She was a really crazy one, ended up with an abusive gang member in New York and would call my friend to come rescue her and torture him with the idea of getting back together. He really needed a strong influence to stay away from the pitfalls of that kind of drama. ""You should be sooo grateful bro. This is a lesson, and you got out easy. No kids. Nothing to keep you attached to her. You are so lucky, yeah it hurts, but you're going to be okay and now you know the truth about this type of woman.""

It was months later when he was back on his feet, dating another girl, and I was the one calling him, overwhelmed with all kinds of shit after my breakup. And he was there to guide me through it. That means the fucking world when you're stuck in your own head and it feels like everything is falling down around you. It's after trying everything else: lifting, running, writing on here, driving around, music, meditation...  And you still don't feel okay.  You need to talk to someone, man. Someone who has been there before. Your male friends are your most valuable assets in life. 

Gym, money, friends, plates, hobbies.  There is a real lack of emphasis on friendship and brotherhood on the red pill these days. Alpha wolf is different from lone wolf.  Make it easy on yourself. Go out and get some friends who you can respect and trust and build a support system for yourself. Seriously, the benefits of having friends will make a woman so much less important in your life, and we know that is great for your game. The difference between her flaking and you staying home being lonely that night, vs. she flakes so you call your friend and go out to find ten new women to replace her. Or having a full schedule of adventures with your friends for the next week, so you don't have to fake having a full life. Women really don't care if you're learning piano and two new languages Tuesday through Thursday. You might still be forever alone. 

If you have a ton of stories involving your friends, it's always easy to have something to talk about. You can even use them in openers, like wave at a girl and say ""oh sorry I thought you were my friend's fuck buddy."" That right there is enough to keep her mind moving for ten minutes. 

Anyways it's been said here before that your woman can never really be your friend. But you can find friends who really fill the need you have for that kind of support. And I recommend everyone to do so if you do not have that. Go get some friends, or upgrade your friends if they are idiots.",148,1

Negging is Dumb.,"If you‚Äôre read any sort of ‚ÄúHow to date girls‚Äù or ‚ÄúPickup Artist‚Äù advice, you‚Äôve probably heard of the term *negging*. A ‚Äúneg‚Äù is an insult or passive-aggressive comment made towards a girl to bring her down a few pegs, when you sense she might think she‚Äôs ‚Äútoo good for you‚Äù. Some examples:

*‚ÄúYour clothes don‚Äôt match. Should have worn brown shoes.‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúYour roots are showing.‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúYour nose is a little red. You‚Äôre like an Eskimo. Cool.‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúYou look like my little sister. Weird.‚Äù*

The idea is by bringing her down, you‚Äôre showing her you‚Äôre not intimidated by her beauty/confidence, and you‚Äôre also showing that you‚Äôre more confident than her.

Except, negging is fucking idiotic.

By making a snide, passive-aggressive comment, you‚Äôre subconsciously telling yourself you don‚Äôt respect the girl, or you think she‚Äôs a bit of a bitch or too arrogant/mean‚Ä¶ but she‚Äôs still worth your time. You‚Äôre actively choosing to talk to, spend time with &amp; try to have sex with somebody you don‚Äôt respect (do you insult/make snide comments to people you respect?)

You‚Äôll also only screen in girls who don‚Äôt mind if you insult them. Any girl with a modicum of self-respect is going to think you‚Äôre autistic for insulting her, as if your parents didn‚Äôt teach you basic social skills or tell you to be polite to strangers.

I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs healthy to spend time with girls who require you to neg her in order for her to bestow upon you the gift that is her pussy. It‚Äôs a hoop I personally don‚Äôt want to have to jump through just to get her, &amp; I think any man with any self-respect should be better than that. If you can‚Äôt get her without negging her, then good riddance ‚Äì you‚Äôll go find a cool girl instead.

Look I get the rationale for it. I get that if you meet a girl who‚Äôs ‚Äúguarded‚Äù and a bit bitchy at first, it sounds good on paper to disarm her with a neg and show her you‚Äôre not going to take her shit. The issue is, *there are other girls out there in the world*, and you don‚Äôt need to be focusing your time on the bitchy or guarded ones. There are plenty of hot, *sweet &amp; friendly* girls who don‚Äôt require a neg just to talk to them. Focus your time on filtering in those girls instead.

Advocates for negging say it‚Äôs just a simple way to show you‚Äôre not intimidated and nervous by a beautiful woman. But hiding your nervousness isn‚Äôt even that important ‚Äì I‚Äôd argue it doesn‚Äôt really even matter. The way to get laid is to hit on a *tonne* of girls (‚Äú[play the numbers game](https://killyourinnerloser.com/go-talk-to-more-girls/)‚Äù). You DON‚ÄôT need to make every girl like you, and it doesn‚Äôt matter if sometimes you‚Äôre nervous, or intimidated, or say something stupid ‚Äì just move on and go hit on another girl. I‚Äôm nervous and intimidated by plenty of girls ‚Äì and so are all of my mates who regularly get laid ‚Äì it literally *does¬†not¬†matter*. You can be nervous and still get laid if you hit on enough girls (and have your fashion sense, body and style somewhat sorted).

Ironically, by embracing your nervousness and being ok with being intimidated by hot chicks, you accept the nervousness, which in itself gives you an air of confidence. Sounds strange, but *you‚Äôre comfortable being nervous*. I say to girls all the time, ‚ÄúHey you‚Äôre really sexy and I‚Äôm nervous talking to you, but I‚Äôm Andy. You single?‚Äù Me being totally ok with my nervousness makes me less nervous and I appear very confident ‚Äì not to mention I don‚Äôt have to sit there stressing and overanalysing every single word in the conversation.

The only way to really improve your confidence is to talk to as many girls as possible (and be ok with the fact you‚Äôll be nervous/intimidated for quite a while). Over time, by hitting on hundreds/thousands of girls, you‚Äôll *become* confident and less intimidated by their beauty. You don‚Äôt need to fake it with stupid lines and lame insults ‚Äì in fact, these will only make you more self-conscious and nervous, because you know you‚Äôre just putting up a front.

Bisexual or she fucked me over?,"Hey I'm new to the sup and I'm (20m) and she is (26f) I got to know her after she broke up with her boyfriend. I soon learned that she was bisexual and she told me that people come to her (chase her). I heard from her friend that she was into older guys. Then I invited her to a party at my place and she pulled the first move on me, she asked if she could place her head on my shoulder and I knew she wanted the D so I told her ""I think you need a kiss too"". I gave her what she wanted that night, then next week I contacted her on Facebook ""do you wanna come over to my house"" and she said sure and she said she had plans with her friends and she canceled them to meet me instead and so I fucked her again.
Then Corona virus came and fucked shit up so we spoke on Facebook and I called her occasionally... Fast forward to june after me sending some sexual texts to her which she seemed to like them. Later that night she reminded me that she was bisexual and that she had another guy on her mind nut at the same time she told me she found it weird to hangout with guys but at the same time she told me we could still be friends and she would cuddle with me. When she started hanging out with friends again after quarantine I wrote to her suggesting we meet and when the came the time came she told me it was her sister birthday and the week later knowing we were going to meet, she told me she planned something with her friends to go to the park to celebrate her own birthday and she made it sound like I would be the only guy attending the birthday, and what I would like to know is how I should respond to this by either going to her birthday or not and if I should bring a present (Marilyn Monroe coffee cup) she said she likes Marilyn Monroe and I also got her a pink cover to sleep with.

How to remain emotionally uninvested -- The definitive guide.,"*Summary : Hate--not women; but their cheating, home-wrecking, dick-chasing, nature that has been ingrained in them through evolution.*

&amp;#x200B;

Body : I recently saw a post on asktrp, asking about how can we remain emotionally uninvested in women. While others have given some really great ways -- become abundant, become sought after etc etc. It might be difficult for the beginner to actually maintain a strong frame and show very little emotional investment.

Since we have a chicken-or-egg paradox, we need a simpler method. We need a way to emulate the physical response that makes us emotionally uninvested.

&amp;#x200B;

The answer is simple really.

&amp;#x200B;

Rollo quoted Xpat Ranting‚Äôs blog : ""I really, really, really hope the myth that girls are the hopeless  romantics gets kicked to the curb ASAP. Everyone needs to realize that  men are the ‚Äúromantics pretending to be realists‚Äù and women; vice versa""

I don't fully agree with this. 

**We men, ARE logical beings while ALSO being the true romantics; but women ARE emotional beings TRAPPED in an illusion of being the true romantics**.  

If you notice closely, the original quote states that women are relaists/logical. But they truly aren't. A woman will stay loyal to an abusive thug and not give a shit about the good guy who would have loved to treat her like a princess. She will face every abuse and mistreatment, just to be with the thug. Even if you give them TRP, they'll still stay with the abuser.

I don't call that logical. In fact, I feel very sorry for them. 

The men on the other hand, ARE logical beings while ALSO being the true romantics. But the reason we had to suffer through our bluepilled days, was due to our false assumption that women would also be logical like us. We now know better.

Now coming back to how we can be emotionally uninvested. We simply need to hold women to our logical standards, even though we know that they aren't logical in nature. It seems very counter-intuitive, but it's the truth.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you ever feel it's difficult to remain emotionally uninvested, just ask yourself these questions :

* How can we love a woman, when we know she'll only love the scumbags who treat her like garbage?
* How can we love a woman, when we know we can never lean on them for support?
* How can we love a woman, when we know that she'll cheat on us the moment she gets a chance?
* How can we love a woman, when we know that she truly doesn't love us, she just loves an illusion of us?
* How can we love a woman, when we know that the marriage vows mean absolutely nothing to her, and she'll destroy her own family, just so that she can ride on some strange dick?
* How can we love a woman, when we know that while we're fighting wars and putting our life on the line to protect our country, she's getting her guts rearranged by the jobless musician that might has a couple STDs?

**These questions serve one purpose : Create some hatred in your heart.**

It's not violent hate, it's not dangerous, it's just  a form of disgust that we feel--not towards women. We know that they can't control their behavior. We feel disgusted by the darkness of reality. We feel disgusted that if we ever become weak in our frame, she'll be jumping on dicks like they were the cure for COVID.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**So, how can we ever feel emotionally invested in something that disgusts us to our core? The best we can do, is to accept women's nature and guide them so that they destroy their own lives and take us down with them.**

&amp;#x200B;

Female Coping Strategy: A short analysis of FDS's main copes,"It's been a long time since I checked FDS, but it seems they are up to the same strategies since I left. Every now and then I like to see how the sociopaths will try to manipulate and guilt me into marrying their decaying corpses- how it's actually better for men and all that hilarious hoohah. Here are 2 classic copes they use on each other (also hoping men will see them and be tricked). Remember FDS only came out as a mirror to the red pill. They love that we are watching them.

1. FDS loves to bring up those meaningless surveys  indicating the happiest demographic is single women. Ignoring how useless surveys are, that survey is based on subjective feelings of happiness which are meaningless. A crazy old spinster can delude herself into thinking shes happy, or she can scream at the world that shes happy, but it doesn't matter- happiness is a transient state and has nothing to do with living a fulfilling life. 

My grandmother is old and unnatttactive but that doesnt matter because she has descendants who love and respect her and will always be there for her in her old age. These crazy spinsters will never know what it's like to be the respected and loved matriarch of a family. You see, only a woman's husband and her sons will love her in old age because only men have honour. Men know that if you gave us your best years, we should honour you by taking care of you in your old years. If you were not there for us when  you were fertile and nurturing and beautiful, we owe you  nothing when you are decaying. The most satisfied and fulfilled demographic is overwhelmingly successful married people with big families, theres no dispute over this. As men we make peace early in life that no one cares about us for who we are, for women it's a shocking realization as their fertility fades and they realize they arent actually a queen by birthright.     


2. FDS contributors love to imagine guys like us as middle aged alcoholic losers who are coping online but I promise you brothers that is pure projection. They make fun of us for saying life gets better for men with age, because they want us to keep needing them. In reality, what happens is that a MGTOW man finds hobbies that he loves and pursues them while the single women party train runs off a cliff. Let's say at 30 years old he gets into carpentry. As time goes on, his dick has less control over his mind, he is less horny and thus more immune to the sexual power women have over him. He laughs/ pities the 22 year old dudes who are slaves to their dick. Every day his mind spends less time drifting to the thought of women and  more time on his hobbies. Now hes 40 and an amazing carpenter. Hes excited for his new projects, hes making good money, having fun by building things with the friends he made also into carpentry. Maybe he even has a YouTube channel and a little fame. He dates when he wants but he no longer feels such overwhelming urges that he used to. Meanwhile that hot girl he was obsessed with at 30 has aged 10 years and her sexual power fell off a cliff. She wasted her time on subs like FDS so she has no actual skills or abilities that make her marriage material- she isnt loving or nurturing, she cant make a home beautiful, she can barely cook( and dont u dare Imply she should); all she has are sociopathic manipulations to try to trick dudes into thinking shes a good wife. She now has more than just one glass of wine with dinner. She feels good for a moment cause she read a post on FDS about how its actually middle aged single men who are unhappy not her. Our middle aged guy is outside working on his deck, having a cigar with his buddy. He wants to have a kid but hes selective with his women and doesn't let his dick pick for him. Life's good.

So you see MGTOW men, the suffering ends and life gets better as long you have the courage to move in the direction of your dreams. As you get older, you will realize how insignificant vagina/ sex is. Its just another worldly vice like drugs, decadent food, and all other pleasures. Sure they have their place, but ignoring them and pursuing real world accomplishments will always leave you vastly more fulfilled. Let the FDS crowd bask in their wine induced, delusional ""happiness"".",74,1

You Play The Game To Win,"Battle of the sexes. What an appropriate term. That's because this shit is a battle. Love is war after all. 

That's why it'll always be your imperative against hers time and time again. 

---

A few years back I had just broken up with my (then) ex and (now) baby mama and I began seeing (read: fucking) a single mother. 

I hit her up on a dating app. Told her to make that hour and a half drive to my place. We smashed and I expected the end of it. 

Slowly but surely she started talking about her divorce, her nine year old daughter, her future plans, etc. All that shit went into one ear and out the other. I didn't give a fuck.

Then she asked me questions like what I wanted to do. I told her that I was thinking about becoming a doctor (I legitimately was no lie) and then she turned to me and said ""That's great! While you're in school you can just focus on that while I stay at home and take care of everything."" 

Man I did the biggest mental face palm.

I was thinking like, you were so fun until you opened your mouth and said that. To me she was the fun fuck buddy I used to hit bars with when she didn't have her daughter for the weekend. But now she was another one of those buzzkills and shit. 

But I was like fuck it, we can keep hanging out. 

One weekend I went out with her and two of her friends. One of her friends knew that she liked me a lot so she kept her distance from me. 

Her other friend must not have gotten the memo. 

This chick was younger, thinner, and a lot quirkier as well as dorkier. Typical nerdy white girl. Nothing special. But as she continued to (not so subtly) hit on me I was like 'Okay, I can change her life for a night.' 

By the end of night I had exchanged numbers with her, but the single mother was pissed. On the way home after they dropped me off the single mother got into a fight with the much younger girl. Gave her a black eye and shit. 

She called me telling me about it. I was like ""That's pretty funny,"" and laughed. 

As we kept hanging out she became more and more entangled with me. The last straw was when we fucked and she turned over and said ""I love you."" 

Oh man you should have seen the look on her face. 

She was killing herself for saying it. Started trying to back track and shit (""Oh no I meant I love your dick""). 

Because she knew, and I knew, that spelled the end.

I slowly distanced myself from her. If we weren't fucking then we weren't gonna see each other. She started blowing up my Snapchat and shit, and I just blocked her and that was that. 

She had her imperative (commitment) and I had mine (no strings attached sex) and I wasn't gonna give that up. 

------ 
Fast forward a couple of years. 

You ever been with a bitch that you knew was a thot, but didn't have the balls to admit it? 

Like you just know. After the first date, the first fuck, you just know deep down. That hoe alarm going off like the Dragon Radar when a Dragonball is near. 

When I was in college taking some classes I met a bitch like this. Light skinned, short, nice tits. I bought weed off her and she used to smoke it in a hotel room. We hung out, smoked, fucked, and drank. Then proceeded to live our life the rest of the week like nothing happened, even as we both walked into the same class together. 

She knew the proper procedure, which meant that she (*gasp*) must have done this before. 

Sometimes she'd let it slip that she had a few flings, a couple of LTRs, a ONS, etc. Just a little sprinkle of truth here and there. The entire time I played it cool. Of course she'd never tell me the whole truth so, why should I do the same to her? 

Then an idea popped into my mind. What if I lied and told her that I wanted to become a doctor? That really seemed to get bitches goin (per my previous experience). 

So after a fuck session I told her that I wanted to be a brain surgeon because my dad is a doctor (he really is) and I wanted to be a doctor like him. 

She immediately jumped on me and started riding that shit like a rodeo. 

A few weeks of this goes by and Thanksgiving break is coming soon. She asks me what I'm doing, and I really didn't know so I shrugged. She then asked me if I wanted to hang with her and her family and I said no. 

She flipped her shit. 

I was accused of leading her on, saying that she thought we were getting more serious, etc. I just looked at her, let her vent, then she stormed off. 

I just sighed. 

Welp, that was fun while it lasted.

Blocked. 

------ 

In this battle over imperatives, I didn't care if I lied, misdirected, lead on, whatever. Because that's what they'll do to you to fulfill THEIR imperative. 

That's why sexual strategy is amoral. In all of my years of dating, I've gotten exactly what I wanted. I have no complaints. Because I knew how the game went, and you just gotta do what you gotta sometimes. 

And yes I'll lie, cheat, mislead, misdirect, whatever the case may be. Then when the bitch is used up I'll go on about my merry way and find me another one. 

I chose to knock up my baby mama cause she was domesticated. She spent most of her life looking after children (her nieces and nephews) and she wanted to have my child really badly. As a mother, she's picture perfect, as an LTR, nah. She has her role and she feels fulfilled with being a mom. 

Every bitch has her role. That's the way I see it. Winning is the getting the most out of them while putting in the least. Small investment, big return.",18,1

Men subconsciously know about the red pill but they don‚Äôt realise until an event ‚Äòawakens‚Äô this area of consciousness. Men KNOW that women are less fertile for a shorter period of time. They KNOW that they lose out in their early twenties because women are at their peak fertility and thus their peak attractiveness. However, due to the fact that schools/universities specifically cater to women now (a combination of women having peak fertility from the age of 16-23 and historic patterns of men benefitting from the education system) men specifically chose to become more Beta/submissive. However, one demographic has shown that men can have it all their own way. 

Black men in the West can pick and choose who they want. White women love them due to their bigger penis size, black women love them due to their sense of ‚Äòownership‚Äô. Thus black men realised pretty early on that they can control the CC if they want to. Evidence of this: the vocabulary of Black Rappers since the conception. They know that if they have money, influence and aren‚Äôt in jail they have the pick of the women riding the CC. Even if they want to settle down they can still be an Alpha in a LTR. However, there is a catch. 

Examples like Will Smith show that if you believe in the Beta lifestyle women will become the Alpha to compensate. They‚Äôll believe you earned all the money because THEY deserve it. An example of this is in packs of lions. Few males compared to LOADS of females in a pack. The females exert all the energy just so the men can enjoy the spoils of the hunt - having their full before anyone else. 

It‚Äôs not a coincidence that the Father in the Bible is described as a lion and the son is described as the lamb. Men are supposed to sacrifice when they‚Äôre young so that when they mature into sexually desirable men (26-45) then can choose who they want to marry and reproduce with. It‚Äôs no coincidence that majority Christian countries focus on strong men and the more they become atheist the more they lose out (Nazi Germany, the USSR, Communist China and North Korea are notable examples).",2,1
Gender-Role-Play,"This ended up a bit too lengthy for me, but after the TL;DR it's just some over-explaining for the newbs.

Field-Report flair because this contains examples of frame, and Gender Roles

**TL;DR:** Women with good fathers, alpha mates, traditional upbringing all have something in common. 

They know WHEN to switch gender roles. 

Women are **masculine** when they feel that they NEED to be. You ever notice that the ""assertive"" boss lady is a tender kitten at the holiday party when her masculine husband is within ear-shot? 
She no longer feels that no one else is there to protect, or lead her.

**Body:**
There was a post about women being generally angry towards men that I 100% didn't relate to. I recognize why i didn't get it: 

I do manual labor. The PEOPLE I've worked for hire me because I'm MASCULINE. **Not because I'm stronger than them.** It's because they don't know wtf to do, and they need someone to step in and lead.

I'm not saying that JUST to humble brag, but to point out where gender roles become VERY clear.

**Example:**
I had a lady the tell me to open a package because carrying the whole thing would be too heavy.(It was maybe 50lbs max) 

I said no, leave it in.

That situation went down like this:

She, being feminine, tried to help. Good.

She, being a modern woman, tried to lead. Bad.

I nudged the package to see how heavy it was before it was time to move that package. (The map given **wasn't** the territory)

I went to move the other stuff.

She, being a modern woman, tried to open the package after I said it wasn't too heavy. Bad

I stopped her from opening the package.

When it was time to move the package, she FINALLY saw me lift it, toss it on my shoulder, and start casually walking with it.

She, being feminine, went to make sure the path to where it needed to be put down was clear. Good!

**Another example:** I was hired by a woman who had her brother and boyfriend helping her. I woke up late, and rushed there because they ""needed"" me to move some of the heavier items...they thought it'd take 3 people.

I get there are start moving these items alone, while they watch. I see this all the time. 

The woman stops leading, lifting, SHE STOPS BEING MASCULINE. 

Now she's saying ""I want this to go here"" (In a suggesting way, not in a ""It makes the most sense here"" way), ""Could you please...""

Now she's being a girl again ""maybe i don't want this"" she runs to her husband to ""talk"". No matter what they're talking about, in **most** situations it's the ""it's ok baby, he does this a lot he's just used to it"" talk. The feminine man stands down, and becomes feminine.

**Last example, I swear** A MAN hires me. He knows his modern young son isn't strong enough to be the only person helping move this fragile item.

I get there, he has a game plan. He knows where we're moving it will be difficult to maneuver, and it was. (The map given **was** the territory) I am now within his frame (You can call it being more feminine if you want; That's the language I established here) 

He is **leading** with competence, and confidence. As a good leader he switches his frame whenever there's a problem he didn't for-see, and asks for my input.

We start moving it, and run into trouble. Here's where women and a lot of men start saying ""I don't know if this is possible"", or ""Maybe we'll just toss it"". His son starts doing this. His son's seemingly geeky friend starts helping, and thinking of good solutions.(Masculine without being Mr Stoic Liftzalot)

We move it TOGETHER as men. The son's wife goes outside to watch the van (rather than watch her husband be helpless). When we reach the point of it being easier. The son starts being feminine. Pointing ""This goes here""(Though it's 10lbs, and he can move it after I'm done. I'm hourly) but Hell, he's paying, I can't even blame him there. The other men start helping. Doing the lifting, figuring out the situation.

**Summary:** Masculine frame is earned, and used as a tool. It's not something you claim, and use as a toy. The world will call OSHA on your ass if you play with your tools",23,1
About stability and self confidence,"#Introduction

-------------------------

There are a lot of posts about self-confidence and how to boost it. While most posts go in the right direction and advise things that will work, no post I've seen so far actually explains the science behind self-confidence. 

#Body

**Animals**

Animals have some pretty simple ways of defining their rank orders. Most animals that live in herds basically define their rank orders by fighting against each other. When an animal loses a fight, something interesting happens; its serotonin levels decrease massively. Because of this, most animals will begin to literally hunch over, making themselves as small as possible, so others won't attack it again. With each fight an animal loses, the probability of it fighting another animal sinks. 

If you give a defeated animal some anti-depressants (which basically increase the serotonin in its system), it will go right back and fight the other animal again with more confidence. It will also change its body posture to go more upright.

With those fights, animals find out pretty fast where in the rank order they are placed. The lower in the order an animal is, the more nervous it is. It is more anxious, it will turn down fights, it walks with a more defensive posture, it doesn't even try to attract the ladies, it will literally become depressed. The animal knows, that stronger animals could fight them at any time, and would also definitely win. 

Animals that are higher up in the rank order feel secure. They know that they will win fights, so they know they can defend their home, their stuff and their status. The ladies see status they have, and will choose to pair with them. So the alphas don't even need to try to attract the females. They feel self-confident. Literally. 

**Humans**

You will already have realized some parallels between animals and us humans. The problem with the comparison is this; men don't fight each other anymore for their stuff and for their ranks. That's why we have developed a pretty smart system in our brains, that constantly scans how other people treat us, and then decides where in the rank order we currently are. If other people treat you nicely, respect your words, ask for your opinion, don't insult you etc., your brain will begin to think ""my rank must be pretty high here"". If other people walk over you and generally don't care about your existence, you will think, that you're low in the rank order (because you are). 

This becomes a downward/upward spiral. When you're high up, you will (unconsciously) walk more upright, be braver, more assertive... Because you feel strong. The primitive part of your brain knows, that if someone were to fight you, you would defeat them. This in turn means, that other people will treat you even better, women will love you, you will not have to do anything for female attention, thus rising your status even more. You will more likely be able to withstand temptations like drugs and other short term gratifications, because you feel safe, you will plan for your future, because you can afford to.

When you're low in status, the opposite happens. You will walk more and more hunched over, trying to seem small. You will be afraid of social interactions, because your brain tells you, that other people could attack you at any time, and they would also win. You will not speak up for yourself, you will live more and more in the now, because maybe you will be dead tomorrow, because someone very strong decided to fight you. You will be more susceptible to instant gratification, making everything even worse.

When you're on the lower end, you won't get attacked currently by other men, because we have evolved as a species. But the primitive part of your brain will still expect it all the time. This is a very stressful situation. 

Now what could a low-status men do? Well obviously you need to raise your perceived status. And that's where the other posts get many things right. If you go to the gym to get ripped and start walking more upright, other people will treat you with more respect. This means, that your brain will tell you ""hey look, they treat you nicer, this means you're raising your status"". 

What will also help? Stability. Remember, an animal low in the rank order will live in a constant state of fear and uncertainty. It's very unstable, because not even his pathetic, status-less life is save. Nowadays you won't get attacked, and you won't lose all of your belongings when you're on the low end. This means this fear is irrational (more or less). If you build yourself some stability in your life, you will inevitably feel higher in the rank order. What kind of stability? Any. Literally any. Get in the habit of getting up on the first alarm in the morning. Make your bed directly after getting up. Do this every morning. You WILL begin to feel more stable. Develop micro-routines. Get up at the same time, go to bed at the same time, eat more or less at the same time, choose a day a week to clean your room/apartment, track your macros, brush your teeth 3 times a day... Anything. Those are all things you can start doing TODAY. You don't need anything you don't already have.

These things may seem mundane, not-that-important, boring. But they are incredibly important and powerful.  

Grow your status. Trick your brain into being more self-confident. Become an alpha animal.

* Serotonin regulates your self perceived status. And vice-versa
* Betas are unstable, alphas are stable
* Self-confidence = stability

Transcend the Decline.," 

I, a Red Pilled man plan to fuck these hoes and get one thing: *Female validation.*

I help contribute to the downfall of society for I lack self-respect and have these self entitled women think they can even sleep with a guy as fit as me. All my hard-work is so I can get off to women using me as a sex worker. Except I don't get money!

All women are sluts, hence why I encourage their lifestyle.

**My purpose?** To fuck white, Hispanic, and black holes.

I'm free to be a slave to my impulsive need to have sex.

Lot of guys on this sub-reddit act like me you see?

Why live a life of self actualization when you can live a life of pussy annihilation.

I'm simply saying *(for those autistic)*. Don't use women as an excuse to not be better. Read the manipulated man and focus on things that actually benefit yourself.

Women are a pleasure for you to have every once and a while.

**Fuck the world harder than you fuck women**.

Dominate at whatever you set out to do.

The two greatest warriors are time and patience; a man can do anything if he has those. 

Use your time wisely and be patience for results.

Plant your garden right, and the seeds will grow.

Read books, workout, eat healthy, practice your craft, and enjoying learning.

There are no experts only learners.

Amber Heard used her Assistant's Rape Story as Her Own,[removed],0,1
AITA delivers again: SIMP doesn't know he's dating a sugar baby.,"&gt; Before anyone gets upset, I am not insisting that she quit this job, and if she chooses not to, that is her prerogative. I just asked her to consider doing so.

God forbid a man has any input over his gf's decisions.  If she won't submit to your headship she is not LTR material.

&gt; My girlfriend, Ana, is currently a law student, her second degree after qualifying in a language degree. During the summer, she works for a family friend named David. She calls her job a personal assistant, but it seems much broader than that - she is his translator and interpreter, she goes to events with business partners as his ""date"" or ""partner"", and when clients visit David at home or go to dinner with him, she entertains their wives and makes drinks or entertains or cooks, etc. When David hosts events, Ana runs them, wrangling guests and arranging seating plans and so on. In essence, it often appears she is a kind of ""hired wife"". I have never encountered a job of this kind before. David is mid-30s and unmarried. Ana has alluded to him hiring escorts when they are abroad. I have never met him, but this made me feel very uneasy.

The lack of self-awareness is mind-boggling.  You can tell that due to his blue pill conditioning he thinks its perfectly okay for his gf to be some other guys ""date"" or ""partner"" but deep down inside beneath of it he know it is wrong.

&gt; For the whole summer, she is with him - there is a room in his London house she calls her study with a sofa she sleeps on, and they regularly travel abroad together. I never see her during this time, she claims to work from 7am to 11pm six days a week and says David does not like her to use her phone during work hours. She also said David does not like her to eat during work hours either but he counts her going to the gym as a valid use of work hours. On top of this are ""business expenses"", such as David buying her clothes. Even when she is at university, she is frequently getting phone calls from him at all hours of the night, which she says is due to the time difference.

This obviously is not a real job, this is just her whoring.  The fact that the guy still doesn't get it as he's typing this out says a lot about how insidious BP conditioning is.

&gt; Two nights ago, we had a big fight over this job. I told her she looked like she had lost a lot of weight and she just brushed it off and said she had a stressful job. I said it seemed like a very weird set of duties, and she got defensive it had started out as a more normal job but that she had taken on more duties as David had started to depend on her. How much can he depend on her when she's still at university for a third of the year? She let slip during this conversation David was funding her law degree and paying her a stipend even when she was not working, and I told her that I found the whole arrangement to be very suspicious, asking if she was sure it wasn't something sketchy or that she wasn't being exploited in some way, not saying in what way. I told her she might want to reconsider a job which basically turned her into a non-sexual escort and that I was uncomfortable with the whole thing.

She lost weight only because wealthy alpha David prefers her skinny, and unlike her beta BF she does what he says.  Her duties include staying attractive for and having sex with David.  Unbelievably, he still thinks she's a ""non-sexual escort"" whatever that means.

&gt; She shut me down and told me that I was being a controlling AH and that her job was her own, and that even suggesting she consider what a weird occupation she had was a massive dick move on my part. But me, I genuinely feel like I'm going crazy anytime I try to explain her job to others... and even when I think about it myself.

When they say you are being ""controlling"" they typically mean ""you are making it hard for me to keep you from knowing that I am fucking another guy"".  That she is with him 96 hours a week and beta cuck still doesn't get it means she been having an easy time of it.  Even the normally feminazi commenters on AITA can see it.",124,1

Shift Your Fear (A must read for Incels/Virgins/BluePilled),"So guys,

# ‚ÄãSHIFT YOUR FEARS

Are you afraid of that special beautiful her rejecting you?

**You should be more afraid of living a boring, sexless life.**

I'm a comp-sci student who trained himself to lift once a 2 days, so hear me out.

I was bored as hell, and went out skating. I was wearing very generic clothes, nothing special. A pair of jeans, some tee. I even forgot to put my watch on, not to talk about any other accessories.

As I changed my mindset and gone out skating, this happened. On my way home, I saw a random stranger looking for books in an exchange point. **As I went by, smiled and said ""Hi""**(Kind of a cold approach but without all the cold approach awkwardness), we immediately clicked. She said ""Hi"" back and asked me some questions. So there we go, we talk about literally anything, for more than half an hour. She was giggling, laughing, smiling. She was clearly into me. Fast forward, and I have a number close and scheduled a date.

Though I didn't get laid the very same minute, the whole interaction was pretty wholesome for me. That was my first successful cold approach **which created good emotions for both me and her.**

**And I know that even if she wouldn't be FWB with me, she will for sure introduce me to her friends. That creates a MASSIVE outcome independence.**

Warren Ellis Being Publicly Shamed for Withdrawing Attention from Women He Was Orbiting,"Google will turn up a fair amount of links on this.

I think this is noteworthy as a new low in turns of what a prominent man can be accused of.  It's a trial balloon of sorts, an attempt at shifting the Overton Window.

tldr; He wasn't accused of anything illegal, merely of paying attention, presumably in the hopes of some sexual activity, then withdrawing it unexpectedly, causing psychological trauma.

Basically, Warren Ellis, a somewhat famous comic book creator, attracted the attention of ""aspiring models"" and other attention hungry women.  This led to a lot of online chatting, and attempts by Warren to extract nudes, or sexually provocative pictures, and maybe consensual favors.  Nobody is accusing him of rape or sexual assault, or anything illegal.  Instead, he's being accused of psychological abuse because he would pay attention, then withdraw it, presumably, if he thought he wasn't going to get what he wanted.

But where have we seen THIS behavior before, hmmmm???  To all the guys who have invested inordinate amounts of time, energy, money, attention, or whatever, into a supposed relationship with a woman, only to be ghosted, gaslit, or told to fuck off when there was no advantage to the association, in accordance with Briffault's law.  Do we see the women being accused of some moral crime?

What's hilarious, is that each of these women probably has 20-30 orbiters of her own that she extracts from, and who do the orbiters have?

The women were attracted to Warren because he was a famous celebrity who opened himself up to mentorship requests, albeit apparently from attractive women.  He actually helped a lot of these women with their careers.  But, since he was juggling so many of them, and is also married IRL, which he disclosed to a fair number, if not all of them (What the hell were supposedly moral women doing reaching out to a married man?  Let the motherfucker get a divorce first, or don't waste your time.), so he couldn't possibly pay attention to all of them at the same time while keeping up with his work and family responsibilities.

For many of them, this may have been their only brush with greatness: knowing a celebrity.

And then of course, they experience massive entitlement, and want to bootstrap attention off of him in perpetuity.

So, they put together a website, and most of the accusers are anonymous, and the usual suspects pick up the accusations and amplify them.

The women claim that they want to get rid of the power dynamic that created the ""abuse,"" but they were the ones that elected to kiss up to a powerful man in the hopes of career advancement, and who even played along with his little sexual fantasy games.  Only, when it didn't work out how they expected, they get angry and butthurt at having their expectations dashed.",36,1

"Bugman Life: For the disposable male pleb, the city is strictly commercial and has little to no refuge from mammon","- Summary:

The majority of household wealth built up on Long Island over the past 30-odd years was accumulated by union workers such as teachers, police, civil servants, electricians, truckers, plumbers, etc. It was not done by a 35-year-old restaurant manager still struggling with college debt and paying $350 for a monthly railroad pass. So what possessed these gentrifying woke worriers to come to New York, only to share a studio apartment with a total stranger and catch bedbugs from Mr. Iqbal Alam on the 2nd floor?

Ah yes, but there is New York‚Äôs appeal to the ambitious: ‚ÄúIf I can make it there, I‚Äôll make it anywhere.‚Äù This stems from an amalgamation of influences on the two sexes.

One of them is the career opportunities offering an illusory portal to wealth. All these young, impressionable, newly minted college grads jockeying for position. Sadly, for most, their big-money fast aspirations will dissipate as they find themselves stuck in lower- to middle-tier management, with those in the upper echelon patronizingly assuring them that ‚Äúthis is good job experience for you.‚Äù 

Second is peer and social pressure. Parents want to live vicariously through their children. They want the best for their next of kin and want them to do better than they did. So they begin to project their fantasies and rightfully so, after all she‚Äôs a star! Captain of the Marist College track team, she returns home on break to take part in various virtue-signaling events. He finished top in his class with a Regents with Honors and is a talented guitar player. No parent wants to explain to their neighbor that Brittney is a hairdresser at the corner and Robert is working in sanitation for the county. What a crowning achievement to slap a university sticker on the back of the family SUV. The pressure to perform is the backbone of proletariat culture.

- TLDR:

American women have been raised like men minus any form of responsibility (hypoagency) because no matter what they do, daddy‚Äôs Visa or Mastercard tab is open and bottomless. In recent years, daddy has been supplanted by the sugardaddy. There is this fictitious idea that she can work corporate, marry a man who does not exist on the socio-sexual hierarchy and live happily ever after. This is what I like to call Perpetual Disney Dreams. City ads help foster this dream during her daily drudgery. ‚ÄúDucking out for an early lunch? Shh! No one will know. You got this girl!‚Äù

Millennial woman consciously pine for a bygone era, the idea of being a part of the leisure class, which was fostered by Hollywood with such works as Breakfast at Tiffany‚Äôs, Gossip Girl and of course Sex and the City. But today‚Äôs cinematic New York is no longer about all-you-can-drink champagne brunches but rather 2 Broke Girls, or worse, SMILF.

Men on the other hand look to suffer short-term, working and living to shove off in their later years for greener pastures. Look no further than Hispanic union workers with dual citizenship. They delay gratification to build compounds in their respective homelands but at a heavy cost. 

For the disposable male pleb, the city is strictly commercial and has little to no refuge from mammon. His environment is hostile as he tries to navigate the concrete jungle of HR, sociopathic employers, alphabet soup bureaucracies, radical feminists, slumlords and a constellation of foreigners. He has volatile interpersonal encounters where the behavioral rules are fraught with contradictions. 

For some men, the FOMO effect coupled with the bleak long-term economic outlook gives rise to YOLO city indulgences such as lavish meals and visits to the Lucky Lucky 777 Golden Foot Spa. It would take much longer for these types to dislodge themselves from the city rat wheel. 

Nightlife? How does blowing it all on drinks with a 300% markup at a gay bar or a bar that‚Äôs not supposed to have gays in it but still has gays in it sound? $50 covers cool with you? How about a concert where performers phone it in because the crowd (usually gays) is unenthused or easily distracted. Did I mention gays? Getting home? The subway service is always out of operation for never-ending repairs after 11pm; hell, it can be out of commission during rush hour. 

Lifestyle? For her it isn‚Äôt too bad considering she‚Äôs at peak sexual market value, but she is quickly discarded by men because she has developed a bad habit of sleeping with married hedge fund managers, unbeknownst to her friends or family. Despite her status as a failed InstaThot, she‚Äôs still able to upload a photo of her flashing the V-sign in Dumbo, a Michael Kors bag slung around her shoulder ‚Äì provided by you guessed it! 

- Conclusion:

For him it‚Äôs about finding a niche and cutting costs and corners. He‚Äôll indulge in pot smoking, porn and mind-numbing video games as his work routine leaves him mentally exhausted into the weekend. He cannot have any toys because his living space is too small. Maybe he will get a motorcycle (hopefully it doesn‚Äôt get stolen) and uploads a picture of it with a jacket he bought on Madison Avenue. Naturally all this runs its course, the man leaves, has a midlife crisis and indulges in his own form of retail therapy. Buys a condo or reinvents himself as a haggard sexpat in the Far East or South America.

She regresses and becomes a social hermit popping SSRI‚Äôs or the well-known wine cooler aunt in upstate New York, maybe moves back in with her parents and rescues a dog(s).

City life is a series of unstable flickering images and its serfs are finding it more and more difficult to achieve continuity and permanence. Fahgettaboudit!

"Why would you need ""game""?","In the area where I live (SE Asia), when you see a scantily-clad girl dancing in a nightclub or bar, you just have to guess for how much she would do it.

I just tell her: ""Look. I find you cute. I'll give you $100 if you come to the hotel with me tonight for an hour or so."" 

Some girls would do it for less, like $30 or so, when they are older, or don't look as fresh any more.

These girls are not professional prostitutes, but they are certainly not virgins either.

So, they've got nothing to lose. On the contrary, many of these girls are often short of cash. For example, if she needs to get her motorbike fixed, and she has already run through her student allowance for the month, she will be inclined to say yes.

Therefore, why waste time on ""game""?

I don't want to spend hours in a row bullshitting to a girl, when I can also get the job done for a few greenbacks.

These girls almost never say no. Only virgins do, but they usually don't hang out in these clubs and bars. Sometimes it happens that the girl wants more than I think that she is worth, but in that case, I tell her that we will do it next time instead, because I did not bring enough cash. At that point, she will usually just ask ""So, how much did you bring?""

I don't know how things work in the USA, but in Europe, if the girl is Eastern European or Russian, I know from experience that this approach works like a charm.

Conclusion: In my opinion, you don't need game to get hold of casual sex. You just need money; and not even that much.",85,1
Need help Sueing for false accusations,"A couple weeks ago I posted something about being falsley accused of rape. Yes it happened and no I am not a troll.

"The ""Insatiable Alpha Window""","I posted this as an answer to a comment elsewhere but I don't know if I've ever written about it. The ""Insatiable Alpha Window""

The reason you want to avoid women with high body counts, and older (always single) women.

The higher the body count, the more likely she's alpha widowed (i.e. all subsequent partners are overshadowed by 'the one' who broke her tingle meter). 

But, as the number grows and she ages, she reaches a state I call the ""Insatiable Alpha Window."" Like an alpha widow on steroids.

So here's the theory:

Women tend to be hypergamous, that is, their goal is to get the highest quality partners they can. The easiest way to measure ""higher quality"" is by comparing mates to each other.

First guy makes a little cash, drives a beater. Second guy drives a Bugatti. Second guy wins.

First guy is strong, second guy has abs. Second guy wins.

First guy has a good sense of humor, second guy is locally famous and everybody knows him. Second guy wins.

And so on.

Women like men who are better than other men. This should not be a surprise to you.

Well, over the years, women might date a lot of guys. Some buff, some rich, some charming, etc.

Eventually over time, she will start comparing new men, not to a single previous partner, but instead, to all partners. 

She dated a rich guy, a funny guy, a strong guy, and now if you don't compete in all 3 categories, then she thinks she can do better. And she has done better... just not in one guy.

But for her, that doesn't matter. She is now subconsciously comparing you to multiple guys and will be disappointed when you don't rock her the way each one did.

The strong guy was better at sex. The funny guy had a better sense of humor, etc.

She has been alpha widowed. But not by one guy. By all the guys.

""Insatiable Alpha Window""

This leads to the thousand-cock stare, but is also why women in their late 30s+ tend to be more independent and less likely to settle down (unless it's to a beta bucks). They can no longer get the tingles from any particular guy except maybe a super hero but her chances to land one diminish as she speeds well past the wall.

Eventually, at a particular age, she will either settle into an unhappy marriage, or rationalize why she's happier alone.

But she will never be truly happy with any mere mortal again.",138,1
How to soft next on the spot: STFU and EJECT,"Something I've done many times and destroyed many relationships with women in my bluepilled days was to LASH on her ass the moment she does something disrespectful towards me. I thought communication was key and we had to understand each other in order to have a healthy relationship, but to my disappointment, that never worked. It only got things worse. When you lose frame she stops respecting you entirely and it's only a matter of time she'll leave you after. 

But then knowing TRP and having multiple options constantly, I'd say that now I can handle girls disrespecting me in a better, more respectful and more appropriate way than just hurling emotional insults at her. 

My recipe for an effective soft next is to 

A. Point out what is making you pissed calmly and as objectively as possible

B. Eject from the situation believing in your core you'll never return to her until she proves you wrong because you most likely have better options. 

I can't guarantee this will work all the time because it really depends on how attracted she is to you. So in case she's not attracted to you and she disrespects you and you don't tolerate it and eject, she'll retrospectively ghost your ass and you'll never hear from her again. But then you won your self-esteem. 

You showed her you can't tolerate that shit and if she wants to stay with you she'll have to be more respectful. If you bite on your lips and stay instead of nexting even after disrespecting you, you're in for a shitshow you're much better off without. 

It's really all about your attention. If she's being a good person who's treating you right, if her shittests are still teasing and shake you a bit but not offend you and so on, then she's worth your time and awesome company. It she disrespects you, you teach her that you can't tolerate that and eject.",22,1

The Trans-Humanist Agenda (Blue Pill NeoLiberal Indoctrination),"In essence, liberalism is about ""liberating"" oppressed factions from domination.

The liberation of children from families, instead giving them to the state.

The liberation of women from men, instead giving them to soulless corporate jobs.

The liberation of immigrants from borders, instead giving them free reign to invade and not assimilate.

The liberation of people from God and connection to divinity, instead giving them Science!‚Ñ¢ and degenerate morality.

The liberation of the sexually healthy from sexual norms, starting with same sex, then tran-sexual relationships, and soon, pedophilia.

The list goes on.

*Today, we will be discussing Trans-Humanism, the liberation of humanity from itself, and how it relates to you, as a red pilled man.*

***

**Trans-Humanism is the name given to the idea that  new technologies will be used to improve characteristics in humans such as physical and mental capabilities.**

It is a generously funded and highly organized movement with the intention of replacing all aspects of human beings - meaning the physiology and biology, all the way down to our unique individual thoughts we possess. This includes the replacement of all existing religions and spiritual beliefs with a new religion of their own, a one world religion.

Many people have trouble understanding what the true Trans-humanist movement is all about, and why it's so bad. *After all, it's just about improving our quality of life, right?*

**Ever since the beginning of our childhoods, we have been psychologically conditioned by Hollywood blue pill TV shows, movies, music and other media to be highly materialistic and heavily reliant on technology.** Even to this very day we are still being conditioned, and the role of technology is helping to push the acceptance of implanted RFID chips, [and even romantic / sexual relationships with robots.](https://youtu.be/c6ZSZGUlHZ8?t=37)

Simple examples of this phenomena can be found in many movies or TV shows which include robot or android characters. They often make the viewer feel sympathetic toward the robot and in turn this makes them feel emotional, if say, the robot were ""killed"" by a human. It's also worth noting it's almost always a human causing these robots ""pain.""

We'll take a quick look at two Hollywood movies, aka sources of ideological indoctrinates to shift average people into the NeoLiberal globalist world view. ^I ^am ^aware ^rule ^6 ^says ^no ^examples ^from ^fiction ^however ^I ^believe ^this ^falls ^under ^the ^exception ^clause ^which ^states ^Discussion ^of ^overarching ^popular ^culture ^themes, ^however, ^is ^on-topic ^and ^makes ^for ^an ^interesting ^analysis ^of ^the ^shifts ^in ^cultural ^thinking.

The robot characters in the examples below are shown to have good morals and human like emotions throughout the entire movie. As a result the viewers are conditioned into attachment to the robot, and show compassion and sympathy towards them.

**How The Blue Pill Indoctrinates And Pushes Cultural Narrative Through The Music Industry**

The universe is made up of matter vibrating at different frequencies. In essence, the universe is made up of sound, and this includes us human beings too. Sound is widely used as a therapeutic tool and can alter mental and physical states in human beings. Music activates nearly every region of the brain. The limbic system in the brain begins to fire off when we have pleasurable experiences. When you cum in a hot thot, it's your limbic system going crazy at dat ass making you want to do it again. That same network of neurons also fires when we listen to music which we enjoy. Those neurons help modulate levels of the neurotransmitter ""dopamine"" in the brain.

Dopamine is one of the neurotransmitters in the brain that makes you feel ""good."" *So when you listen to music you like, you get an actual change of the chemical levels in your brain.*

**Once a person identifies they like or have as their favorite, they begin to imitate and mimic them in many ways.** This is an example of the blue pill indoctrinating the average person to live in a *simulacra,* a simulated inauthentic reality. 

Anyways, if you don't believe people imitate their favorite artists, take a look on askTRP and see how many unfortnate people try to imitate James Bond, Tyler Durdan, or other media alphas. Or look at the effect thug hip-hop has on the African American community.

**The artist's songs and videos are designed to influence the listeners and viewers so that they imitate the artist.** This applies to TV shows, movies, and music.

*This is why the music industry is now being used to push the Trans-Humanist agenda.*

**While you watch porn and stroke your wiener, you are in a highly suggestible, hypnotic trance. Listening to music is no different.** By having nearly every region of your brain active, you begin easily susceptible to psychological attack, even by your favorite artists.

The examples of the Trans-humanist agenda being pushed by the music industry are endless, so I've picked out a few for you to view.

[A prime example of the Trans-humanist agenda can be seen clear as day in Rihanna's live performance of ""Rude Boy,"" where she performs on stage with dancing robots.](https://youtu.be/ySC9-AHXwag?t=73) *The robots have nothing to do with the song, which is extremely sexual in nature.* [Why involve robots with sex?](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/05/10/47C69F2F00000578-5238357-Dr_Cathy_O_Neil_from_Harvard_University_claims_females_of_the_fu-a-1_1515148177406.jpg)

The purpose of that dance routine is to make the viewers feel as though the robots are sentient beings. **The whole idea of the Trans-humanist agenda is to make humans view inanimate objects and technology as being on the same level as human beings.**

This leads us to our next topic.

***

**Sexualizing Technology**

By now you should have realized that the Trans-Humanist agenda is not about the improvement of the human species as many incorrectly believe. **It, much like all other facets of blue pill indoctrination, is about the manipulation of the human consciousness,** so that human beings no longer see themselves as human beings, but rather much like a piece of technology, to be used and discarded when obsolete - [bugmen,](https://pics.awwmemes.com/bugman-fantasy-pac-arvel-soympod-amazon-home-pod-living-delivery-66569978.png) economic units whose purpose is to [drone, consume, and serve.](https://i.imgur.com/aDnwO1g.jpg)

*If I saw you - my loyal reader - as but a dehumanized piece of technology, I could do to you as I please without feeling bad about it.*

**This phenomena holds serious consequences in terms of the evolution of human consciousness and humanity here on earth.** Successful indoctrination into the blue pill, and subliminal psychological manipulation by George Soros and the Open Society Foundation in support of the Trans-Humanist agenda [leads us to view each other as inanimate objects and thus we no longer feel obligated to show common decency or compassion towards one another.](https://archive.vn/H4bv)

*Here are a few more examples of the Trans-humanist agenda at play...*

[Drake becoming a cyborg](https://youtu.be/mh6vHoyBs58?t=22)

[Chris brown is unironically optimus prime](https://youtu.be/VN3MqudFUOQ)

You might be thinking, *""oh, this is just coincidence that they became robots, it just innocent harmless videography.""* But you must remember they hire professional teams to work in think tanks to design and promote certain ideas. Every element of a music video is chosen.

**Hollywood, General Media, the Music Industry are the Blue Pills three most powerful tools and they are extensively used for reaching out to the masses.**

These tools are used by the Blue Pill master-minds to carry out evil agendas in order [to condition people into a certain way of thinking.](https://youtu.be/t4zYlOU7Fpk?t=29) The Trans-Humanist agenda is just one of many being pushed by the Blue pill through Hollywood, the music industry, and the media.

In order to be successful with their agenda, proponents of Blue Pill Ideology use every resource at their disposal - Hollywood, the music industry, and the media. However, they also have advertising agencies (ever notice how 9 times out of 10 relationships on commercials are inter-racial?) and *the video game industry* at their disposal. These fucks even have control of Reddit, which is why you should create an account on TRP.Red before our forum gets nuked. If the proponents of the blue pill did not have control of nearly every industry, their success at indoctrinating the masses and shifting culture to their twisted ideals would not be as successful as it is now.

***

**Here's where shit gets creepy**

Most of the artists promoting the Blue Pill agenda are under *Monarch Mind Control.* Monarch Mind Control is basically a subsection of MK Ultra which was a CIA mind control experiment officially running from the 1950's to the 60's, and unofficially to the present day. The Official government documentation have been declassified and you can read them on Wikipedia. 

*If you don't want to read the entire documentation, here's a breakdown:*

Basically, the mind control is brought about by traumatizing events, which may include torture, electro-shock therapy and other forms of abuse. This causes the victim to disconnect from reality so the programmers can create an alter personality which allows thoughts to be programmed or implanted into the victim, to make them do as required.

This is a type of mind control which is so horrendous that it dehumanizes a person and makes them like a robot, an expendable piece of biological machinery that can be used by those in power and thrown away. A useful idiot. This method of mind control is also almost totally undetectable.

When a person is undergoing trauma induced by electroshock, a feeling of light-headedness is evidenced, as if one is floating or fluttering like a butterfly. A quick google search and you will see all the butterfly symbolism used by celebrities in hollywood. The butterflies - hence the term - *Monarch.*

**What you can do as a Red Pilled Man**

*""The basic underlying philosophy of Red Pill, imo, is discover and think for yourself.""* -Innaskillz2k10

If you don't see that Red Pill has ALWAYS been political, you're an idiot.

Red Pill was 'sexual strategy' as men who were ill-effected by feminism. The strategy, guides, readings, Rollo were all written in a context of modern-day (at the time) feminism. It is hugely political and ideological. Red Pill always has been, always will be. If you haven't had your head up your ass for the last six months you'll see the political landscape has gone up shit creek.

A red pill man must be aware of what media he consumes, *""for the mind is a garden that one sows seeds into,""* - Thrice Greatest Hermes.

The music you listen to, the books you read, the shows you watch will shape you into an intelligently engineered pseudo-person if you are not careful to **consider what it is you read and watch, apply critical thinking to your shows and see how blue pill proponents want you to accept their vision as the new normal.** A red pill man must be aware. 

The media would have you believe it's cool and in-style to be an uneducated, illiterate, weak-willed beta male - ready to serve the most powerful masters and mistresses. **The blue pill wants you to give up self-improvement and buy an automated fleshlight, AKA an android companion.** Robotic companionship is evolving in the form of Virtual Reality dating simulators.  I'm here to tell you that it's cooler to question your reality, swim against the current and be a strong, healthy bodied red pill swoldier. [Be an alpha male by having sex with real women, against the party's wishes.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ubv-wvlFiuQ/hqdefault.jpg)

"""My Boyfriend is Upset I've Destroyed My Ability To Pair Bond by 21, AITA?""",""" *I‚Äôm a (21f) dating my bf (23m). I understand some people don‚Äôt like their partners body count and it can be a deal breaker in some cases but my boyfriend asked me what my body count was and told me not to lie to him and I was completely honest to him. My body count is more than 10 but less than 20,* ""

So she's fucked 19 guys by 21. Lets assume she started fucking at 18 (lol), that's like 6 guys a year for 3 years. 

There is a saving grace to this story:

"" *he got upset right away and stated since I‚Äôm a woman I should hold myself to a higher standard. He has said that woman who are promiscuous deserve to be treated like ‚Äúthots‚Äù*  ""

Fucking based. 

A good rule of thumb, or at least I think so, is to treat any woman who you don't explicitly know the sexual history of as if they have a body count higher than their age. This will save you trouble. Specifically it should help you keep your guard up so you don't fall too hard for a hoe. 

Another thing you should totally be doing: Vetting your women. This guy is doing the vetting AFTER he made a commitment to this woman (ie made her his girlfriend). That is poor management. Listen, if the girl is fucking a guy every other month, I don't think he needed to commit to her to get some strange. Why buy the cow, etc.

Further to that point, look at the loss of frame this poor schlub must live with. Because (judging by the numbers) this is probably the first guy to give this girl commitment *without her having to earn it,* she doesn't feel she needs to 'walk on eggshells' as it were, with him. This is not a good state of affairs. The girl should live in a state of fear re: the foundation of the relationship. ""If I fuck up doing this, this guy WHO HAS STANDARDS is going to leave me, so I better act properly"" is the mindset they should have. But look at this situation, she feels comfortable enough with this guy to freely tell him that he is dating the village bicycle. Contra your feminist indoctrination, this is not a good state of affairs for their relationship. She doesn't even have enough dread/respect for her man to lie to him. 

So in summary: assume all women are hoes until you have evidence of the contrary, vet your hoes before granting exclusivity (making her your girlfriend), and don't grant that exclusivity easily. 

PS: And if you have standards, you need to live by them. This guy went on a rant about how women with high body counts are thots, without immediately demoting his thot to a plate. So basically this guy has no standards, you bet your ass her hamster has picked up on this, and she will treat him accordingly. Don't be this guy.",335,1

GiaMay is a nineteen year old free spirit. Communist in a way most other leftist will never be. I challenge her beliefs in communism with a simple question;

*‚ÄúHow do you handle the problem of human nature and people being selfish and lazy?‚Äù*

Her defense is the most honest thing I‚Äôve ever heard from a self proclaimed ‚ÄúCommunist.‚Äù

*‚ÄúWe gather all those people up and kill them. Eventually they all die out or people learn to not behave that way.‚Äù*

This statement is so straight forward and raw that all I can do is give her props for her honesty and move on from that topic.

10 minutes later my cock is shoved in her mouth with tears rolling down her cheeks. Every time I pull her head away she begs, *‚ÄúPlease daddy, deeper!‚Äù*

I sit at my computer, completely unsure of what to do or where to turn. This had been a small disagreement but for some reason the piling up of things had made this the straw that broke the camels back in my mind. I open up a web browser and start to type:

*‚Äòmy wife gets offended by people disagreeing‚Äô*

I honestly can‚Äôt even remember the chain of links and pages after searching that phrase over five years ago that led me to TRP‚Ä¶ but what ever path I took to get there‚Ä¶ it saved my life. The next morning I bought No More Mr. Nice Guy. By the end of the week I was looking for a group of like minded men, and thankfully found one.

I realized that week, that my life would never be the same.

*‚ÄúSlap me!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúNo, in the face.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHarder, pleeeeaase hit me harder!‚Äù*

She was not my first, last, or even an overly memorable girl in the string of women over the last few years. Save for the interesting behavioral stories she would provide me with‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt even remember her name. She was just a girl, plain and simple. 

The most surprising and memorable thing about her had been her brutal Machiavellian honesty in response to my question on human nature. Things most guys get excited about:

* Her age: 19 (Almost 20 years my junior)
* Her slim toned body: Perky tits, tight ass, 5‚Äô10‚Äù height
* Her willingness to meet me for a first date in a hotel suite: I booked it just for this date.
* Her submissiveness in bed: See above

Stuff like this didn‚Äôt shock me or stick in my mind anymore. I‚Äôd seen it too many times from too many women over the last few years. When I first read AWALT on TRP, I thought to myself, ‚ÄúNo way!‚Äù

Experience had taught me a much different lesson.

I finished NMMNG very quickly‚Ä¶ I knew what I had to do. The past 30+ years of my existence had been a sham. I was playing a character I thought people wanted me to be. Doing things I thought others wanted me to do. Never really asking myself, ‚ÄúWhat do ***I WANT*** to do?‚Äù

Those days were behind me now. I was determined that from that point froward I would live my life according to one simple rule: Do what you want to.

The last five years have been a journey of me trying to live that way.

I stood on the edge of cliff five years ago and had a choice‚Ä¶ ‚Äú**Jump or Die**.‚Äù

I wouldn‚Äôt have died a physical death, but it would have been a spiritual and mental one, slowly, agonizingly as I wasted away from what I could be into‚Ä¶ what? I don‚Äôt know, and I‚Äôm glad I never found out.

I am who I am because I jumped.

After a few hours of hanging with GiaMay, I‚Äôm spent. Physically and mentally‚Ä¶. Have you ever had to sit and listen to nineteen year old talk for a few hours? It‚Äôs horrid. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love the shit out of ‚Äòem but I don‚Äôt want them around for long periods of time.

I roll over in bed after looking at my phone and let her know it‚Äôs time to go. She‚Äôs not surprised, sad or anything. She hops up, a smile gracing her face that would challenge the Cheshire Cat, and gets dressed. She never had any expectations of this other then what is was. God‚Ä¶ did I mention how I love nineteen year olds?

As she gets dressed and gathers the few items she brought with her. I think to myself, *‚ÄúIs there more to life than this? There has to be right?‚Äù*

I don‚Äôt have the chance to contemplate the ramifications of that thought before she‚Äôs ready to go. As any gentlemen would, I walk her to the door, give her a kiss on the cheek and wish her a good evening before ushering her out into the hall‚Ä¶ never to be heard from again.

Girls who do ketamine,"Gentlemen, I have oddly discovered that in this year alone, a lot of young women I know do ketamine. 
I live in New York and have family in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 

I know these two places usually tend to have more of that crowd, but by god, it is more abundant than I thought. 

Excuse me for showing my opinions too openly, but this ketamine addiction is more contemptible than it is tolerable. 
The woman who engages in ketamine is one usually of childish character. She is the kind that flees from reality and into the precious arms of a blissful intoxication. From herself. 

A man speaking to a girl who takes ketamine suddenly asks himself ‚ÄúWhat sort of reckless life has she been living?‚Äù and consequently, she spews out all the details of her life and her ‚Äútastes‚Äù. 

The cosmopolitan young woman is one of immense privilege and immense opportunities. She knows very well what a fabulous lifestyle is. She takes ketamine perhaps out of boredom, perhaps out of depression, perhaps even out of out vanity. 

But isn‚Äôt life too short for them to be vividly wasting their youth on such drugs? And for what? To make them forget. To make them stop remembering  their fleeting youth.",33,1

"""Have A Mission"" is...nuanced","I used to think I liked smart girls.

Now, don't get me wrong, I do, but what I realized I *actually* liked was that smart girls liked *me*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're a thoughtful sort, TRP can really change your outlook on a lot of things.  A lot of people become less interesting---where before they seemed chill, now they might seem aimless and distracted.

Whereas you, you're *directed*.  The mission comes first!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's a pitfall you can fall into with mission-first thinking, though---it can make you *too* aloof.

 - The thing is, a girl can't have sex with your job, your startup, your house, your degree, or even your PR's (and while she *can* have sex with your mannerbund, you don't want her to!).  Don't get me wrong, all of those are good things---but you want her to have sex with *you*.

 - So what are you?  Basically: a brain, in a body, in clothes.  What is the experience of being around you?  Are you lively, or lost in thought?  Is the body she sees strong?  Is it relaxed?  Have you slept?  Are you smiling?

 - My point is that focusing on a mission can compete with all of those.  I was up until 2 last night working on a project, and it kind of ruined me today.  Don't get me wrong, I was getting stuff done!  It was worthwhile stuff!  Will pay off in the future!  But a girl can't have sex with your future---and even if she could, you wouldn't want her to.

 - What I'm basically looking for is: is a girl pleasant to be around?  Will I get a stiffy just from walking behind her?  Is she affectionate?  Can I talk to her?
 - Women want the same, or the male equivalent anyway.  Yes---more is required of you *in the long term*.  But you're not trying to check off boxes, you're trying to create an *experience*.  And you---you, in the physical world, *are* that experience.

 - So take care of *you*.  Get enough sleep.  Eat well.  Dress well.  Seek cash*.

 - You need less of a mission than you think.  *She can join you* on your mission!  So many chicks out there have no idea what to do with themselves they go to law school or whatever.  
 - Lots of girls out there would be perfectly fine with ""He makes money, and I cook, clean, and fuck him""---*if* the ""He"" in that sentence is cheerful, well-dressed, and has a plan.  If he's withdrawn, mind on work, etc., this becomes much, much less true.

Basically, TRP has different messages for different crowds:  if you're just kind of doing nothing with your life, you need to change that, not just for her, but for you.  But if you *are* doing something, you'll get more bang for your buck by paying attention to what it's like to be around you.

Fix the stuff you're worried about.  Be kind to yourself before you adopt a self-sacrificing mission (looking at you, Christians and NRX guys).  Get good sleep, don't be afraid to pursue cash.

The man with a mission,"Another dawn approaches as the man awakens for a fresh new day. Upon arising from his bedridden slumber he closes his eyes and lets his thoughts flow in and out of his mind until the timer goes off. Meditation complete. The man‚Äôs mind is clear. 

*Ding Ding* His phone chimes and the message reads: 

Her: *Hey what are you doing today?*

*No time to fool around, I have a mission* He thought to himself as he laid his phone down on his dresser and went downstairs for breakfast, the most important meal of the day. 

The man drives to his local gym to become stronger because life is tough so he must become tougher to face it head on. He grinds away on the bench press, and finishes with a few other arm strengthening exercises. 

As he‚Äôs leaving he sees a woman that catches his eye. *Another potential spinner* he thinks to himself. So he chats her up and eventually finds out she‚Äôs not interested. *No big deal* he thinks to himself. There‚Äôs plenty more exquisite china to go around. But fool him not, the plate is only a decoration to the house as a woman is only an accessory to the man.

He arrives home with his mission in mind. *Become the best ME.* He cooks chicken and spinach as his post work out meal, eager to feed his body the proteins it needs to build muscle. He puts on a documentary to wind down while still absorbing new knowledge. 

Finished with lunch he checks his phone to make sure no one has died or called for an emergency. 

The girl‚Äôs message from before still lingers there, awaiting a response. The man feels that he has a bit of time so he responds.

She responds almost instantly:

Her: *nvm u took too long* 

*Perfect* the man thinks to himself, now I can focus on more important matters. He slaved away at his dream, a financially free entrepreneur, every day, piece by piece. He has no time for games for the games being played will never be won at this rate. 

The man has done enough as he sees fit for the day and plans to meet up with a woman he met earlier in the week. A man‚Äôs mission must be his top priority, but fun must be had from time to time or life is simply not worth living. 

So the man and the woman do what men and women are made for, and the day is now coming to an end. He says his farewells and heads home, for he has work in the morning. 

The man‚Äôs mission makes him strong and gives him a purpose. Don‚Äôt let anything get in the way of your goals and dreams, but do have fun. Life is too short to grind away everyday.",32,1

There are some people with manipulative and disruptive ideas on RedPill, myself included. Obviously I don't support Reddit's quarantine of RedPill or banning of other subreddits but for the most part, I could see that there were enough toxic elements on those subs to at least justify a ""ban"" at face value.

I was wrong. They were right. This really is a culture war against men, you can't make any rational argument against it anymore.

**They're not even trying to hide it anymore.**

PornFreeRelationships was banned, a sub dedicated to (you guessed it), porn free relationships. How can something like that possibly be toxic?

NoFap is going to be banned next. A sub that is dedicated to ending porn addiction. What the flying fuck. How can something like that possibly be toxic when the porn industry itself is known for ruthlessly exploiting performers?

The West has decided that free thinking men are a threat to the power of those in charge.

Fuck Reddit and fuck SJW culture.

I absolutely agree with everything now:  TRP.red and Forums.red are the life rafts that men need more than ever to learn the fundamental skills to succeed.

**Learn, learn, learn as much as possible from this subreddit and any other ""men's improvement"" subreddits you go on before it's too late.** 

**Save all good posts in Google docs so you can access them after they are erased.**

An 18 year old trying to figure his life out...,"**A teenager ranting about his thought process..**

""You're lucky you're so young, I'm in my 30's still trying to figure life out"" &lt;-- I've heard this said to me quite a lot of times now. Although I try not to take my age for granted, it still bothers me a bit that the age thing is used as an excuse. I don't want to think I'm better off just because someone else is still trying to figure stuff out later in their lives. I try my best not to compare myself to other people.I don't know how to start this off but lately, I feel as if I'm not sure what to think and how to react or be around others and when I'm alone.

When I'm happy I think to myself ""Oh, what was I worrying about 2-3 hours/days ago? There is nothing to worry about""...then when something comes up I totally forget about my 'clear mindset'. This is one of the reasons I turned to stoicism 2-3 years ago, I feel as if a lot of people my age especially men are trying to figure themselves out in life due to media showing different things about masculinity and whatnot.

I'm quite an extroverted guy when I'm out and can be in solitude when I'm alone, but when I'm out I tend to be the guy in the group who talks the most..I guess that's just a habit I've developed. I have no problems being confident, yet I'm still a bit of the goofy guy that loves to make jokes, both good and bad. At the same time, when I'm more reserved, to myself, I tend to smile a bit less and people around me think something is up because I'm being quite, and I know I'm forcing it a bit as I try to observe what's happening instead of reacting to everything, it doesn't feel natural and people aren't as happy around me when I'm more calm and grounded. My whole life I've been asking people older than me (older friends and my dad) stuff but never get satisfying answers and then I realize, they too are just trying to figure stuff out as well. I feel like I'm ranting right now, and even as I type this very moment, all this seems like it has no purpose so I'll try my best to be coherent.

Currently, I'm big on self-improvement, I want to be the best version of myself, and if I really try, I can stay disciplined and stick to my good habits for maximum a week, then I go back to being my old self. I still go to the gym, I eat healthily but I feel like I'm stuck in this endless cycle. With no progress being made in the past few years, apart from some more friends and a new environment. I've always had a 'not caring about other people's opinion' personality and doing whatever the heck I feel is right, but that makes me a bit more 'negative'? I'm not really sure what I mean by this rant...I feel like I wanted to be headed down the right path before I turn any older, I try meditating as well, and though I haven't been consistent I still try to do 10-20 minutes daily.

I want to do a lot with my life, be in sales, make music, be an actor, model, everything. At the same time, I get moments where I'm like 'Why not just go live on a mountain in solitude? Life is all internal and these external things won't mean anything' If anyone can give me advice...I don't know I'd really appreciate this if people want I can edit this in the future, and add on to it but for now, I feel like I'm ranting...another example is..I was literally scrolling through Instagram 20 minutes ago, seeing people's stories of them drinking and having 'fun' but I thought to myself ""Why don't they stop flexing/put the camera down and genuinely have fun?' but why should I care? It's their life...I sometimes do the same thing...also a lot of times when I'm alone I see myself coming up with scenarios in my head which I know will never happen in real life.

Edit: Stuff is just coming to my head whilst I do other stuff, another thing that comes to my head which I guess revolves a bit around stoicism is the corona, what's the point of me seeing how many people have it, the news for it, etc. if nothing can be done about it, why do I care so much, then I stopped looking at it...but then when someone brings it up like my friends or family and they talk about x amount of deaths somewhere, I raise the question ""Why care about things that don't affect us?"" and I get a response like, ""well then why care about other things, it's just nice to talk about"". I feel like...stoicism makes me...I don't know the right word..maybe dull/boring? All these things I wanna be, it conflicts with the personality of stoicism...I may be wrong, I just need some guidance..

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit but thank you to all the people who read the whole thing!",46,1
Creating a Sexual Vibe in Your Tinder Profile: Body Language Analysis,"One of the biggest mistakes that I see while reviewing Tinder profiles is failure to create a *sexual Alpha vibe.* I realize this concept sounds extremely esoteric and woo-woo magical, but I'm going to do my best to break it down into something more concrete. **In this post, I will examine facial cues that telegraph Alpha and Beta vibes in pictures.** 

# The Split-Second First Impression

Here I will share two images. The first is of [Aziz Ansari](https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a5b93b40ba3dc230ebe7673/5:3/w_1200,h_720,c_limit/aziz-ansari-golden-globes.png). The second is of [Russell Brand](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/670b57d37bfb02cb41748cc8cde54d62a8b8e19b/0_567_4096_4448/master/4096.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e18ea4e74f0849f6a0b2a9754529ee6f). For those of you who don't know, both of these guys are famous comedians. Click on both of these pictures and look at them for a second.

Ansari is known publicly for his ""woke"" attitude, nice guy persona, and support of feminism, and ironically got caught up in a #MeToo scandal due to Blue Pill beliefs. Brand is famous for his outrageous behavior, ""misogyny,"" and smashing a ton of models and other hotties over the years.

Ansari is a Beta male. Brand is an Alpha male.

But you knew that instinctively. I didn't need to tell you anything about their background. You inferred their positions in the sexual hierarchy, immediately and subconsciously, from body language and facial expression. We evolved these instincts over millions of years. Although the idea of a ""first impression"" is just common sense wisdom, modern science has shown that it is all too real. We make sweeping judgments about a person [within a fraction of a second](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/how-many-seconds-to-a-first-impression). The thought is in our brain well before we're consciously aware of it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; A series of experiments by Princeton psychologists Janine Willis and Alexander Todorov reveal that **all it takes is a tenth of a second to form an impression of a stranger from their face, and that longer exposures don‚Äôt significantly alter those impressions** (although they might boost your confidence in your judgments). Their research is presented in their article ‚ÄúFirst Impressions,‚Äù in the July issue of *Psychological Science*. 

# Body Language Cues

Let's go back to Ansari. What, exactly, about his look telegraphs Beta?

First and foremost are the eyes. If you Google Ansari, almost every picture shows his eyes opened almost comically wide. Wide eyes are an expression of fear, surprise, and vulnerability. They are a [feminine](https://s3.envato.com/files/194796211/3-590.jpg), submissive trait, which is why Disney cartoonists draw big, [wide eyes](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c1a4c63d628c2f3866cc3eeebcb9dae71d0d6f27/c=0-563-4434-3068/local/-/media/2017/05/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636303004069925580-Bambi-2017-Bambi-Thumper-Talk-CYMK.jpg?width=3200&amp;height=1680&amp;fit=crop) to convey innocence.

Then there is the awkward, exaggerated, closed-mouth smile. A smile is a complex facial expression used to convey emotion. Most Alpha males sport either a self-satisfied smirk or avoid smiling altogether in pictures (more on that later). Ansari appears to be going for the former, but fails miserably.

Now let's examine Brand. His brow is slightly furrowed, making his eyes appear to narrow. Using the Disney comparison again, [narrow eyes](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/6/66/Profile_-_Scar.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20190312021344) are traditionally the sign of a villain. Guys on incel forums often talk about the ""[hunter eyes](https://incels.wiki/images/thumb/e/e9/300px-Konstantinos_laios_face.jpg/200px-300px-Konstantinos_laios_face.jpg),"" because a predator narrows its gaze to better focus on a faraway target. Brand's facial expression is also neutral, conveying little emotion.

# Alpha/Beta Expression

Looking ""confident"" is really just the PC way of saying looking Alpha. So how do we look Alpha? Yes, I realize how cringe-inducing that sounds. Do you want to get laid on Tinder or not?

There's a reason why I hire actual models and can't just use my handsome friends to display the products that I sell in my business. This shit takes talent and emotional intelligence. It isn't just about being extremely attractive, although that's certainly a large part of it. Models and actors are experts at generating the right vibe and feelings. 

Look at [Leonardo DiCaprio](https://www.romania-insider.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_large_image/public/2019-11/leo_dicaprio_by_id_151273604_denis_makarenko_dreamstime.com_.jpg), who plays Alpha males in films and is also one in real life. Again, note the subtly furrowed brow and narrowed eyes. Notice the mouth, which is upturned so slightly as to be almost imperceptible. But the effect is dramatic - you can see the emotion conveyed through the smile lines in his face. It's a self-satisfied look, like he just nutted in some young model's mouth an hour before...which he probably did.

Now let's look at a smile with teeth. Here is Britain's [Prince Philip](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/Prince-Philip-1290476.jpg?r=1591190398541), another noted Alpha, demonstrating both the smirk and the smile. Having an actual smile is okay, probably preferable in most instances. Not everyone can pull off the ""looking into the distance"" scowl, which usually ends up looking like a laughable ""fake Alpha"" pose. 

Whatever you do, a big, open-mouthed smile is a major faux pas. Avoid at all costs. 

**Head Position**

Awhile back I got to talking with a guy at the gym who trained police officers in ""command presence."" Here's what he told me:

*Dominant:* chin tilted up and your eyes appearing to look down at the target.

*Submissive*: chin down, eyes looking upward.

Never look up at the camera like you're about to give head to the viewer. That's a [female position](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/12RKq7SGeDquZBMD9zXMuoB0HwZy3VuVD6CGIhwEYphuDJjgA8GuIIP5pBiUX0_YmtbUwBcHjRqDcmTgsOEe15idEioKEYCgQ-WIqWm14YF6xGQ36T-9xarV). This [graphic](https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2019/downwardhead.jpg) displays the three positions - sub, neutral, and dom. Don't exaggerate it. Aim for something between the second and third pics. 

**Alpha Expression**

* Furrowed brow and narrowed eyes
* Little emotion - neutral expression, smirk, or only top row of teeth showing. 
* Dominant/neutral head position

**Beta Expression**

Now let's look at [Ross](https://sites.google.com/site/friends2365/_/rsrc/1472782816039/home/ross-geller/ross-geller_480x360.jpg), the Beta character from *Friends.* I have no idea if this actor is Beta in real life or just plays one, but it's a good example. While Ross is objectively a handsome man, you know from his body language - again, instantaneously - that he is a Beta male. He's smiling with only the top row of teeth, which is good. But there is zero expressiveness in the eyes. Note the raised brow, which gives him the Disney doe-eyed appearance. Ross looks like the type of attractive guy who would become some Alpha's prison wife. 

To summarize the Beta look:

* Raised brow and wide eyes
* Big or open-mouthed [Beta smile](https://www.returnofkings.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/soyboy-smile.jpg) conveying too much emotion.
* Submissive pose

# Execution

Remember that this shit takes practice. Before I take my Tinder pictures, I practice my expression in the mirror and turn on music that gets me in the right mindset. You want to be relaxed. That's why a good photographer is friendly. Most people are awkward in front of the camera, which is why ""candid"" shots look better. 

I snap 30+ pictures, with the knowledge that most will be shit and 1 or 2 will be good, if I'm lucky. Search this sub for more in-depth guides on picture taking. Then I take a few pics that I think might work and get them rated on Photofeeler. It's difficult to judge yourself, so you need some honest ""hot or not"" feedback. Set rater age range up to 24 - we don't give a flying fuck about what older women think. 

# Conclusion

Some guys will argue *none of this shit matters, just have 16 inch biceps and 10% body fat and you'll get endless matches.* And you know what? They're right. You can look Beta as hell and still get matches if you're an SMV 9. But profile vibe still makes a difference in how girls will respond to your advances. My Chad friend gets an assload of matches no matter what vibe he conveys. But even he reports that he gets more girls messaging him first and more sexualized conversations when he looks more ""Alpha."" 

Recently I did a post titled ""Why You Aren't Translating Your Tinder Matches/Dates Into Lays."" This post is the prequel to that guide. She goes into the conversation/date with an expectation of how you will behave based on her initial first impression. You're going to have a much harder time if your Beta profile is *incongruent* with your Alpha approach.",63,1

She Had Me Fooled,"I am listening to a midwestern sadboy music mix, and I started feeling. Its red pill to feel things, right?

I'm a youngster, and I ain't much of a plate kinda guy to boot. You can call me a sentimental bloop, but I enjoy companionship, fun times, bonds and memories. Sex might be part of it, but it just aint everything to me.

In fact, the thing I miss the most is the intimacy, sex is everywhere, deep connections arent.

Anyways, I was just doin my thang on Facestagram, sharing dank memes, posting selfies, getting lots of likes comments and shares. Life was good in 2016.

The same day I got 100+ likes on my profile picture update, I received 3 DM's from some pretty cute girls. 3 dates, 2 plates, 1 stayed.

This story is about the girl that stayed, the one I'll never forget, the one I think about while I'm fucking other hoes. That bitch tattooed teardrops on my brain.

Her opener was something about me looking familiar, so I played along and said I know one of her friends. Eventually she just straight up asked me ""So do you wanna hang out with me?""

Fuck, I guess this whole red pill SMV thing must actually be working!

""Yeah sure, just make sure you wear pretty underwear,"" I texted without much thought.

She played coy, ""Now why would I wanna do that?""

A quick look through her profile and I see her posting the classic ass shots in the bathroom, showing off her titties in a bra in her bedroom - ""Well, it's not like I haven't seen it before.""

She responded with the &gt;.&lt; emoji, and our date was set.

I have a routine for first dates, I take her to a bar I'm a regular and half the people know me, (shout out to Tito for letting me in without carding me) then take her for ice-cream, then go for a walk, then back to my place.

Everything went perfectly. We danced at the bar, kinoed with the ice-cream, made-out on my bed, and fucked in my living room. I busted a nut so great in her round ass that it broke the condom. She was hysterical, on the floor crying, bitch was talking nonsense.

I, on the other hand, never felt so calm in my entire life. ""It's gonna be okay baby. Come with me to CVS we'll get some contraceptives. You are gonna be fine. Come with me, trust me. It'll be okay.""

""O-o-o-okay AFTSOV.""

My first real test of frame. Months later she would still bring up how much she loved that moment, she said it defined her attraction to me, but as you'll soon learn, how the fuck could I trust anything this bitch has to say now?

About 3 months into our relationship, which consisted of TV, Fucking, and walks through nature, she brought up the ""us"" situation. It was also the first time she told me she actually loved me.

I decided, let's do it baby. Lets make it US now.

Things only got better from there. She was an artsy goth girl, a fantastic artist at that - and she loved drawing pictures of us together. She even painted a portrait of us together. Among her drawings and paintings were poems and love letters she would send me through the mail as little surprises. Fuck, I think she really loved me.

And how was the sex? Well it was the best goddamn sex in my 17 years of living. Random, passionate blowjobs in the middle of the night - waking up to her riding me, I got to fuck her any time, anywhere, anyways - anal on roofs, handcuffs in public, blindfold and ropes on my bed, anywhere. She even took birth control so I could nut inside since we both liked that.

About a year and a half into this shit and I'm thinking I might have actually found the one to start a family with - this bitch supported me in all my dreams, everything I pursued she was right there on the sidelines cheering me on. She always found interest in my hobbies, always wanting to learn and participate with me. She was more than a fuck, more than a LTR even, she was a partner. She was on my team, and there's nothing more valuable to me in a woman than that.

One day, I was browsing through snap chat and I saw her story, it was a black image with the text ""why cant guys just take no for an answer"" on it. I asked her what happened, and after several minutes of prodding, she finally confessed that she had been raped.

I was furious - I ask her who is this fucker so I could find him and murk him. I tell her to lay out exactly what happened so we can figure shit out.

""Well this guy I've been talking to invited me over to his house. We had wine and played cards on his bed. One thing led to another and I ended up naked and he was inside of me. I told him no, I told him I had a boyfriend, but he didn't listen.""

What the fuck man. I just hung up. She spams my phone for the next couple of minutes, then arrives at my house via uber. I still don't know what to say at this point. ""Damn,"" Was all I could reply to her exasperated explanations.

I let her in and night draws nearer. She falls asleep on my bed and I decide to do some reconnaissance.

Her password was easy to guess, and man that was a treasure trove of heart-breaking red pills for my young and dumb ass.

She had cheated on me god knows how many times over the course of our entire relationship. What the fuck?! How could I have ever seen this coming? Everything I've ever read told me the signs would be distance, lack of love, star-fish sex, shit just wasn't adding up. And It wasn't just one guy she was fucking around with, it was Andrew, Blake, Maury, Peter, Zack, William, and¬†David.

Me and this bitchboy David had beef and she fucked¬†him?

I put the phone down and wake her up.

""How many times did you fuck David?""

""What?""

""How many, times, did you have sex, with, David?""

After a long winded blow-up on her end, I got the answer.

Six times.

All the while she was writing me love poetry, drawing pictures of us together that I had framed on my wall, she was fucking this bastard.

""get the FUCK out of my house, now""

""But it's night time and I dont have a ride and-""

""NOW!!!!""

At this point my parents were awake, and they barged into my room to see her naked on my bed, and me seething with wrath. I punched a hole into the wall. My parents jumped to her side, telling me to calm down, to never yell at a lady.

""Yeah AFTSOV can't you see that I love you!?"" She cried out.

I exploded, ""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU SAY"" and charged at her, my mom throwing herself in between us.

My dad yelled and cursed for her to get out of our house, so she ran outside naked in the cold winter night.

I broke down.

I've been cheated on before, but that was easily explainable. I was acting in beta ways, I was too involved, cared too much about the relationship, no boundaries, the girl was half hearted about me, the works.

But this? I couldn't have seen it coming with a magnifying glass.

I cried, for a long time. Years later, sometimes I still tear up. Infact today I had a dream where I was crying about her.

If I can be treated like a king and still get betrayed, what can I do?

Looking back I could see a few red flags - half naked selfies on her social medias, but what girls dont do that in this age of modernity? She didn't ever take any mental illness medications, or allude that she had one. She always struck me as a loving young girl.

I've never met another girl who supported me like she did, and I always wind up comparing new prospects to her. Today I was fucking a different girl and kept repeating the cheater's name in my head.

If that aint the most gayest shit you've ever read, I just don't know bro.

Homies ask me, ""Dude she burned you, how tf can you still smile with all that pain?""

I just say ""Shit, life goes on nigga.""",2,1

"CLOSE, CLOSE CLOSE: The Importance Of Killer Instinct","&amp;#x200B;

**The Importance Of Killer Instinct**

Chances are, if you've run any kind of game, you've come across times where women give excuses for why they can't go home with you or why they won't have sex once they are at home with you.

""I can't leave my friends""

""I can't have sex, I have to get up early tomorrow""

""I'm tired""

If you are inexperienced, you'll take whatever she says at face value and ""respect her boundaries"". And then you'll wonder the next day why she's only giving one word answers in texts and ""went cold"".

If you are really beta, you'll continue to text her, chasing her harder and harder, thinking ""persistence"" will win her over eventually. After all, you felt a real connection with her, right? Didn't she come home with you just last night?

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bottom Line is Persistence Only Pays Off In The Moments Leading To Sex, Not After:**

Many many inexperienced men, myself made this exact same mistake while starting out. They would listen to the girl's objections leading up to sex, and then when sex failed to develop, they would try being more persistent and aggressive to try to bring her out again, since they were ""SOOO CLOSE"" last time.

From my experience, this never works. Most Western women are blessed to live in a country where there are still enough aggressive men who will take any steps necessary to close when the opportunity presents itself.  Look at the average girl living in an American city. She really doesn't have to take much action to get laid. Chances are your competition is aggressive enough so in order to not fall behind, so you must match or exceed their aggression levels.

Part of the problem is that inexperienced men think they are special, unique snowflakes and that the girl will love them for their ""deep connection"". The truth is, any woman living in the West has a lot of options and if you fail to close in the brief timing window that presents itself, that window closes forever and you lose the girl.

The key is to stop being aggressive and chasing the girl after you already failed to have sex with her by  ""respecting her boundaries"" when you had the opportunity.

Do everything possible to secure sex on the same day you bring the girl home. Assume that there are no second chances. It's either you have sex or you never see the girl again. Are there exceptions? Yes, but for the most part, this is the aggressive mentality you should be operating from. Killer instinct. This is a key ingredient a lot of guys are missing and they wonder why they had such a great connection but the girl won't go out with them again.

Don't ever settle for a weak No! Either get a Yes or a firm No. Weak Nos are just maybes that could have been a Yes if the guy was aggressive enough.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dealing With Her Objections In A Socially Intelligent Way:**

Now that we established the need to persist aggressively when the opportunity for sex presents itself, here is how you overcome all her objections:

**1) Acknowledge the objection** \- Don't ignore her objection. Make her feel understood and listened to. This will establish that you're a good guy and not trying to take advantage of her.

A simple phrase like ""I acknowledge"" or ""I understand"" works wonders. ""I understand you're feeling tired right now..."" ""I acknowledge that you have to get up early tomorrow...""

**2) Use a Joke to diffuse the Tension** \- I've been using this to great success. The thing is, when you try to overcome an objection, girls can sense this and their defenses will be up. Nobody likes being manipulated or having their mind changed about something. Using humor will diffuse the tension, allowing you to really play aggressively when dealing with the actual objection in the next step:

""Yeah, you're right, I have to get up early too. Make sure you set an alarm to wake us both up tomorrow morning, okay?""

""Honestly, when's the last time you met someone has handsome as me?""

""You're probably not used to being around people as charming as me. That's why you're tired""

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Use one of the Objections Dealing Formats below -** If the girl still won't have sex, pull back, relax, and use another format. The human brain is like a lock. Every person has different ways that they can be persuaded to do something. You just have to find the right format for the right person:

CLOSE, CLOSE CLOSE. If the girl doesn't respond to one of these objections dealing formats, pull back and use another one. LOOP, LOOP, LOOP, and never give up until you either get a Yes or a firm No. Do not ever settle for a weak No!

""What's the worst thing that can possibly happen? All I'm asking for is 30 more minutes. Worst thing that can happen, you made a new friend, right? But I want you to imagine how awesome it would feel if you finally met that person you can laugh with and go on crazy adventures with. That'd be a life changing experience, right?""

""Look, we're not going to do anything you don't want to do tonight, okay? I promise, you're free to leave any time you want. But I know we're both gonna have so much fun tonight, and it's these crazy experiences and memories... that's that life is all about. If we have even HALF as much fun as I know you're going to have, believe me, you're going to remember tonight for the rest of your life. Sound fair enough?""

""Look, I really don't say this very often but I really like your vibe, &lt;girl's name&gt;. Do you like my vibe? Let's just spend 30 more minutes together, then you can go. I promise""

""I get the feeling you're not really interested in having a real connection and that you're more interested in playing games. If that's the case, I'm not sure if I really want to continue either. So why don't you tell me. Why should I continue hanging out with you right now?""

&amp;#x200B;

**How To Avoid False Rape Accusations:**

Some guys think that doing this aggressive style of closing will lead to false rape accusations. This is not true.

False rape accusations arise when women feel like shit after sex happens. Typically, in order for false rape accusations to happen, both of these 2 things need to occur:

**1) Lousy sex** \- If you suck at sex or blow your load in 3 strokes, the girl will be like ""what the fuck did I just do?"" Luckily, very few girls will give you a false rape accusation just from lousy sex, but it is something you should be aware of.

Use the sex god method as a basic guide to improve:  [https://www.masculinedevelopment.com/give-amazing-sex-using-devi-sex-god-method/](https://www.masculinedevelopment.com/give-amazing-sex-using-devi-sex-god-method/) 

**2) You made her feel worthless and devalued after sex** \- This is where the vast majority of false rape accusations will arise. The guy is not only bad in bed, but also completely ignores her after sex, falling straight asleep.

Women are at their most emotionally vulnerable immediately after sex. Cuddle with her, stroke her hair, do all that lovey dovey stuff to make her feel comfortable. Go out to breakfast the next day. DO NOT FUCKING FALL ASLEEP and for the love of God, NEVER EVER KICK HER OUT AFTER SEX.

Women use their emotions to make decisions. If you sleep with her, give her shitty sex, and make her feel worthless, who do you think she will blame it on? You!",70,1
Some things I've come to believe,[removed],2,1
PSA: Your frame dies when the Inner Children die.,"Ah yes, welcome to another one of my epiphanies I had, brought to you by an anonymous account I meant to throw away but Reddit won‚Äôt let me on TRP from my actual account. :‚Äô) Let‚Äôs cut to the chase, shall we?

When a woman is with the right man; an alpha she is comfortable with, she feels free to express herself. After all, you have to build this level of trust and *sense of safety* with a girl for her to be comfortable enough to express her body and her sexuality with you, Captain Protector.

And the same goes for you, mister man. Tit for tat; you are an alpha because you know you are the shit and you are comfortable with yourself and your own skin, and you feel safe enough to do this. (Protip: Lifting is great if you have anxiety.) And thus comfortable with your own sexuality and vulnerability. Hence the quid pro quo.

See where I‚Äôm going with this? You and her are just people that are having a fun time, enjoying each other‚Äôs company, different forms of expressions, bodies and sexuality. Vulnerable together yet stronger feeding off one another, the union is made. A bond no different than horny children having fun together.

My days browsing asktrp, I saw many posters asking if they fucked up or whether their frame is wrong, blah blah blah.

Look man; if you have to ask, then yes, you *subconsciously* already know that you fucked up. Let my post be here to save you the time of seeking validation. Either you or her were backed into a position where you lost that sense of comfort to express your inner child, and are now stuck in a corner of repression and/or anxiety. Acknowledge it, own it, learn and move on.

That said, let me serve you some fresh hot science, brothers. For starters, if you‚Äôre being confident and truly expressing a DGAF attitude, you are expressing your inner child, I.e. being authentic, congruent with your personality, true confidence, etc. After breaking down any shit test/ego defense/resistance walls from the girl, if any, then you should reach this core of her personality as well. Behold, the centerpiece of one another‚Äôs angels and demons. That may, perhaps be another post. But this core is the Inner Child; it is the true you, the true her, the oblivious innocence of one‚Äôs personality that was imprinted from and expressed since one‚Äôs innocent youth and will be carried on for the rest of their lives. Many young men and women alike fall to the tragedy of the repression/death of this Inner Child. Be it one‚Äôs work life, a crappy LTR, loss of or abuse from family, incompatible safe spaces, (que ‚Äútribalism explained) etc. One‚Äôs ‚Äúinnocence dies‚Äù and many never recover this inner child. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs hopeless. If you are stuck in a pit of negative emotion, you can redeem it. There are many resources online that you may look into; both on The Red Pill and perhaps even some writings from students of Carl Jung or the man himself. But connecting with one‚Äôs own soul is generally a journey that is unique to each individual, I can‚Äôt tell you how to do this. I digress.

Wanna know why good ole Mother Nature and papa God designed it that way? Think about it. Sex is a natural function of reproduction, therefor produces children. If you feel safe; she feels safe enough to express that inner child, sexuality and all, then behold, the cosmos say you two are compatible to have children. And if it‚Äôs safe enough for your soul, then it‚Äôs safe enough for kids. That is the natural purpose of the Inner Child, and will be the source of social imprinting of your own biological legacy as well. And so the cycle of human evolution goes on to evolve another generation of children growing into adult children. Rinse and repeat.

So along your journey of self-improvement, between working hard and lifting, make sure you spend time getting in touch with yourself, and have some fun. But not too much fun. Unless you have lotion; keeps the friction burns away. üòâ 
Stay safe, kings.",27,1
Do You Tremble Carcass?,"Do You Tremble Carcass?

In response to my comment on ""Quality Women and Alpha Males: Two Examples from my Family"" by u/Psychological_Radish and requested that I include which passages from Nietzsche I was talking about in my original comment by u/barnowl5 and u/edge_lord_super_17

Do You Tremble Carcass?

""Carcasse, tu trembles? Tu tremblerais bien davantage, si tu savais, o√π te m√®ne."" -Turenne

It translates, ""You tremble carcass? You would tremble a lot more if you knew where I am taking you."" spoken by Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne while addressing his soldiers before battle.

Nietzsche chose to include it as an aphorism at the beginning of his fifth book in the Gay Science titled, ""We fearless ones"" as if to make allusions to his philosophy, that these ideas are dangerous and these Truths, difficult to accept. Similar to red pill theory, his writings can be seen to have many congruencies but are much broader than just social and sexual dynamics. 

Start by reading Nietzsche's book, Beyond Good and Evil. Make sure you get the Walter Kaufmann translation for Everything Nietzsche. I've drawn on The Gay Science and his essay on the Genealogy of Morals regarding slave morality and master morality

Pertaining to this comment and post- The Gay Science:

Read:

Book one-21- ""to the teachers of selfishness""

Book four-290- ""One thing is needful""

Book five-345- ""Morality as a problem""

Beyond Good and Evil and Genealogy of Morals:

Essay two is where Master and slave morality are discussed. I've also wrote this comment with the sections above from the Gay Science in mind. I might make a post on this but wanted to start here to allow for discussion.

My original comment: ""Alpha act based on what they want. Betas react to what women think they want a man to be and try to mirror that. Fundamentally, it‚Äôs a matter of identity; the alpha knows who/what he is and builds upon that. He‚Äôs taken time to figure that out for himself. The beta has not. The beta lacks internal identity and so reacts to other people‚Äôs responses and and shapes his false self image based around the validation from others. Nietzsche talks about this along similar lines in more depth in the Genealogy of Morals , being the difference between Master morality and Slave Morality. Slave morality is always reactionary and in the case here, OP shows how women are not attracted to this way of thinking with two good examples and actually resent it in men. So how do you become more Alpha? Refrain from beta-making-behavior i.e pmo negative self talk etc and then 1. Reflect, 2. Become more disciplined, and 3. Implement new, more self-serving behaviors that may not be easy but allow you to grow. Nietzsche also talks about his distain for ‚Äúself-sacrificial virtues,‚Äù virtues that put the good of the whole over and above the good of the individual. In OPs terms, these virtues make betas and naturally lack boundaries. I‚Äôll stop here; might deserve a post on its own.""",3,1

all you [redacted] zombies reduxe,"Note: I was instructed by the moderators of this sub to revise my original statement for quality purposes. 

In my and some other's opinions the quality of the written content on this sub has begun to dwindle. From what I've read as of late, there is too much blaming and not enough ownership. 

From my perspective, I believe this sub was for the purpose of creating success for ourselves and other men within this community.  Not for regularly citing complaints against the females who we decide have wronged us in some way, shape, or form.

I've noticed that some of us have impulsively taken trivial slights they have experienced personally and regurgitated them into the discussions we have here.  From all the reading i've done, it seems that many of you are so fixated on having the upperhand that it defeats the purpose of everything we have learned thus far. In other words, YOUR EGO'S ARE GETTING IN THE WAY of your own progress. 

When you complain about how the women you interact with in life are not giving you the attention and validation you feel entitled to, you are neglecting the entire point of what taking the red pill means. At this point you have already lost your frame, as you have become a frequent victim to opinions/outcomes you have no control over, and should not care about in the least. Not to mention that these women who are not living up to your expectations can sense this about you instantly. 

It is imperative for you all to understand that this whole mating dance/sexual conquest concept is a numbers game with applied theory and strategy. (There are exceptions and this may or may not apply to them). We are making bets based on observable behavior and the outcomes we are aiming for are subject to every single variable no matter the situation.  

In Reality, there's no code to crack that's going to make everything you want happen.

There is no free pass because you punched the numbers in the right combination. 

You are not special. You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake, and no one owes you praise or acknowledgement at any point. 

The opposite sex operates entirely in a manner where you matter or don't matter for a million different reasons which fluctuate constantly.  On top of this, every woman has their own incentives driven by numerous and diverse forces which you have no place in. 

So if all of these statements bother you, then how did you get this far? You can write your little reports on the state of the world and how women are decadent, solipsistic figures of a decaying culture all you want-but its not going to change how they interact with you. This isn't a war for the minds of the female race, we're not conquering nations of women and brainwashing them so we won't have to deal with the problems they cause anymore. We are operating with realistic information that is supposed to help us better our personal lives and get us the things we want.

I think all of us, myself included and especially , need to focus on what we do as individuals and how we choose to react to the things or people that do not serve us. Most importantly, accept that we are external nothings in someone else's point of view the majority of the time, and our place will always be contested in one form or another. If we embrace this, we can become free of all the shit that deters us from our manhood. 

TLDR We shouldn't expect ourselves to matter to everyone. Thinking this goes against everything we learned and doesn't make us look cool or get mad puss.",7,1

"Wherever your priorities lies, always do it with strength","I'm not one to preach to you about ethics, about the intelligent thing to do, or hell, about the cultural values you hold

But whatever you decide to believe in, always do it with strength, from the position of strength

If you believe in the power of man, then you should always strive to lead or support your family or your tribe to greatness. To actually make a positive impact.

A weak man would whine and complain about how women would not let him lead, that they no longer respect him, that it's a symptom of the fall of civilization that women are independent from you. That other men are weak for letting this happen.

Spending your time listening to other men telling you of the decay of society, spending countless hours finding evidence of the decay of society, this isn't what a man does. 

You're even weaker than the ones you called plugged in, since you knew the truth but aren't doing shit about it.

What are you actually doing against this? Do you improve yourself? Do you have people who love you, and love you back? People who you will fight for as a man?

And same goes to the other side.

The men who believe in feminism, that women shall stand alongside other men(or higher , I don't care), then you should do your best on your own to make that a possibility. To actually fight for the people you think are oppressed.

The soy boys do nothing but support their m'ladies, they do not contribute to the women's fight, hell the only thing they do is just to listen and let the girls fight the fight.

 Ever seen a video of any SJW event? the males just stands there, shouting or silent, either way, not bringing any actual positive impact to their beliefs, too weak to do anything.

Whether you believe in God, in food, in nature,  for country , for your family, or for yourself, whether you are a neo Nazi, or a SJW, if every single one of you reading this, fights with actual strength for your beliefs , you *can* make an impact

The Long Haul,"The red pill, good servant, bad master. So dunno if y‚Äôall have seen that Will Smith drama. So here is the low down.

&gt; Will Smith is husband to Jada. Four years ago when Will was knocking boots with Margot Robbie ^unconfirmed/s Jada went into a relationship with her sons friend who is about 23 years her junior. Dude apparently has some life threatening disease. So in a damage control interview, Jada puts Will on the spotlight to try hamster her way out of the allegations.  She leads and basically makes the dude say it was not an ‚ÄúI‚Äù thing but a ‚ÄúWE‚Äù thing.. https://youtu.be/qB9BwdBG3GM

Anyway, it struck me hard how much his life though in the public eye, is macro similar to any dude that has had the unfortunate experience of marriage. Will is ten to fifteen times net worth more than Jada. But this guy has to sit and listen to his wife publicly say how she rode dick for a purpose, because they took a break. Watching that video was a stark reminder why there is no purpose to marrying someone. Dude is definitely lifting, looking good, confidence and all plus money. But he knows that even though she is the one that rode another dick, in the event of a divorce, he would be fucked... MAJORLY. 

If you look at his Instagram he has been focusing on his self, hobbies, traveling the world etc. But his one anchor, the one thing that she has used to kibosh him, is to actually bring up shit about her own cock carousel to force him to address her. I got one thought he did do it gracefully. 50 Cent published private messages between them asking why... totally fucked up to do that but the question is valid. 50 is no where near Will Smiths net worth. Will understands the fall back.

Don‚Äôt fucking get married.... never, especially without a prenup. You will end up having to pretend to be full beta in front of millions just so that you don‚Äôt lose your hard earned money. Remember how the same shit happened to Hulk Hogan. Wife brought in a 19 year old. Took his house and made the dude suicidal. 

Good servant... don‚Äôt rush to flip. Frame comes in different ways. Don‚Äôt Chris Benoit yourself when your wife ends your turn. Use tact. A lot of people think Will is a pussy, but to me, that is absolute frame.... for now.",162,1

It looks a lot like as if some of you are so fixated on having the upperhand to the point it defeats the purpose of the conversation we have here. 

YOUR EGO'S ARE TOO FUCKING FRAGILE FOR ANY OF THE SIDEBAR TO TAKE HOLD AND FUNCTION. 

When you whine that the SJW barista scowls at you, or write a whole post complaining that some random woman you'll only see once in your life and doesn't worship the ground you stand on-you're neglecting the entire point of what taking the red pill means.  You might as well have thrown your frame out the window with all this shit. They can smell it a mile away. 

This whole mating dance/sexual conquest thing is a numbers game with applied theory and strategy. That's what this is. If you're a 10/10 maybe its something else. Realistically there's no code to crack that's going to make everything you want to happen magically every time because you punched the numbers in the right combination. If you get bent out of shape because the opposite sex operates entirely in a manner where you matter or don't matter for a million different reasons which fluctuate constantly and has their own incentives regardless if they make sense or not, then why are you even here?

Surprised to learn some gang bangers in my neighborhood were naturally red pill.,"(I live in Brooklyn) 

I have recently started talking to the gang members in my neighborhood. Besides the occasional dap, I have always avoided then mostly, but in an effort to open my mind to new perspectives, I wanted to see if I could get to know some of them. It has been a couple weeks and What I have noticed is that gang members either see thru most if not all of the bullshit, or are buried sooooo deep under it. Very few in between. However, even those buried in ignorance, lean towards the red pill. 

For example while sharing a joint with one of them. We were talking about girls and he broke down a lot of game to me which basically boiled down too ‚Äúif you treat her too nice/act too nice, she‚Äôll think your a bitch‚Äù. This was co-signed by the entire gang. This was information that I thought only a chosen few had internalized. 

I would‚Äôve assumed that these guys were just unconsciously moving in an alpha manner and were generally unaware of exactly why they were found so attractive by other females. Meanwhile here there are completely aware of why and how their behavior attracts girls. 

I would even argue to say a huge motivating factor TO their lifestyle is the girls..but that‚Äôs a whole other sub. 

But this isn‚Äôt the only time I‚Äôve over heard them  discuss things with a red pill perspective. Over the past couple weeks I‚Äôve learned that, they view the world very similarly to us, just add an irrational lust for wanting to break the law.

Gang culture on a whole is extremely fascinating to me but that is also a different post.",8,1

Censorship is not about the bottom line. It's ideological. Gillette didn't use misandry to sell razors. It used razors to sell misandry.,"When you walk through a college and see that more than half of the students are studying some shit lib major, you should not assume that these people just go away once they graduate. Many of them do go on to work at Starbucks, but some of them get to become HR ladies that influence who gets in the door for an interview. That affects who gets hired and it affects future hires that this newly hired person will one day hire. When this blue haired liberal gets a job, she's not going to say, ""No, fuck my own personal morals. I need Pepsi to make more money this year!"" She's going to hire diversity and shit libs.

-

There are also diversity quotas. Employees in a hiring position that are not specifically against diversity will have to check and see if they are hiring too many people of conservative demographics, such as white males. Reddit's giant ban wave followed in the wake of one white employee stepping down to have a black employee take his place. Reddit hired a black guy who's worked for the NAACP and they banned all the pro-white subreddits. Do you think this new hire was just purely in it for reddit's bottom line and that his entire career of advocating for blacks had nothing to do with it? No, he probably didn't care.


-

One of the ways in which the ruling class has always kept its powers is by spreading various myths about themselves to gain credibility. They have historically said they were sent by God or that they descended from a special bloodline.  We don't accept those arguments today because we live in a capitalistic society that respects money. What these people say now is ""We do this for money and the reason it makes money is that the people want it!"" These companies though are largely giant monopolies that made their money and gained their status long before they became censorious. They did not make their fortune by doing this. 

-

What people are missing is that corporations don't necessarily try to become as profitable as possible. They try to become profitable enough. Starbucks knew that shutting down its stores over those black homeless guys would lose it money and alienate some customers, but Starbucks had enough money to choose not to care. Gillette knew that making a commercial where they said ""Fuck men"" would have the effect on its stock that it had, but it wouldn't kill the company and the feminist in charge of the marketing campaign didn't care.

Quality Women and Alpha Males: Two Examples from My Family,"We're all familiar with the traditional conservative (Trad Con) masturbator. 

You have a guy that comes on this forum and at least partially unplugs. However, he never fully embraces his burden of performance. The prospect of transforming himself into the Alpha guy is too daunting, so he hamsters away the need to make any real change.  Yeah, those Red Pill guys are right, but only insofar as sluts and damaged women are concerned. A real *Quality Woman* ‚Ñ¢ cares about more important things, like religion, building a family, and pursuing a relationship.

**These women don't exist. They never existed.** 

The  *Quality Woman* ‚Ñ¢ myth is really just the fantasy that there are women who will respond to Beta behavior in the same way that other women respond to Alpha behavior, and reciprocate with the same level of intimacy and genuine desire (NAWALT). Yes, there are women who want a husband and a family. There are women who don't go through 50 dicks in college (no, MGTOWs, not *every* girl has an n-count longer than a CVS receipt). There are women who are faithful wives and good mothers. 

**The most dangerous fallacy lies in the belief that these ""good women"" want Betas. Wrong. They want Alphas.**

Let me give you two examples from the era that Trad Cons idealize and worship. 

I had two older aunts who grew up in the 1950s. Both are now deceased, but they were the embodiment of what most men on this forum crave in a LTR. In their younger years, they were quite beautiful. One was an actual beauty pageant winner. They were nurturing women who enjoyed being mothers. They had sweet, feminine personalities that just made you feel so relaxed and at peace. They possessed the social graces and charm so lacking in most young women today - not an ounce of abrasiveness. They did all the domestic shit like cooking, and were happy to play host for family and social events. Neither were ""careerists,"" instead taking low-stress jobs in the teaching profession. Both married in their early-20s, and by all appearances were profoundly satisfied with the relationships. 

Now let me tell you about their husbands. 

""Phil"", who married the beauty queen, eventually became a high-ranking corporate buyer for a large retailer. He frequently traveled internationally, and made enough money for the family to purchase a large Victorian home in an expensive town. In his younger years, he enjoyed fast cars. According to my mom, he ""drove like a bat out of hell."" I was too young to know him while he was alive, but others described him to me as very self-centered. Apparently he was often more interested in his own hobbies, which also included photography, than being the stereotypical supportive father and husband. 

The other aunt's husband, ""Tom,"" was an athlete at an Ivy League school. My mom described him as ""hot"" and a ""stud"" in his younger years. He later had a successful career as a military officer, retiring as a general. Like Phil, he loved fast cars and also drove motorcycles and flew planes. Now in his 70s, he has the energy of a much younger man and is still wonderfully charming, funny, and just generally awesome to be around. 

That said, he lives life on *his* terms and is undoubtedly his own mental point of origin. He can be flakey when it comes to making plans. Sometimes my mom will get frustrated and say things like ""Uncle Tom is such an asshole!"" Still, all of the women in my family, from my early-20s sisters to my late-50s mother, subconsciously acknowledge and defer to his masculine authority while in his presence. They seek his approval. We drove down to visit him once, and before we arrived my mom pulled the car over so she and my sisters could put on makeup before greeting him. 

Both of these men were obviously consummate Alpha males. Their relationship success had nothing to do with the fact that they found a *Quality Woman* ‚Ñ¢. Yes, my aunts were fine women, no doubt.  But they weren't wooed by Betas. They were wooed by masculine, fun, exciting Alphas. 

Too many men try to circumvent hypergamy by focusing on one side of the equation - the woman. They don't look in the mirror and honestly assess whether they are the type of guy that men want to be, and women want to fuck.

Anyone notice women out in public are straight up rude if not hostile these days?,"Maybe it's the overall political climate or the shitshow that feminism has mutated into, but over the past few years women I encounter in public are rude or hostile toward men even if they are with their wives or children. 

For example, went into a higher end store at the mall with my wife a few years ago, and the female salesperson greeted my wife, complimented her profusely, and didn't even acknowledge my existence and ignored anything I had to say during the sales process. 

More recently middle aged women at the grocery store will run you off the aisle even when I have my baby in a stroller. 

Another lady started yelling at me when she parked over the line and couldn't open her own car door. 

The irony, stupidity, entitlement, and superiority are all so misplaced and uncalled for, especially when they claim to be so mistreated by systemic whatever nonsense.

Has anyone noticed social issues started collectivizing themeselves as soon as feminism reinvented itself in the age of the internet?,"I find it funny that nobody notices that feminism is pretty much the only social ideology to derive its caricature from the literal component of identity. However literally no other group does this. Where's blackism or for that Africanism? Where's gayism or homosexualism? Where's Islaminism? 


Social issues like racism, bullying or homophobia were more localized and not as standardized because of regional differences and a different purchase of political, social and corporate interests 


Women on the other hand feel the need to get leveraged by the mainstream more than any other demographic because 1. Women feel very uncredited according to what I am always told and 2. Women technically have no actual platform advocating for them. Where as social issues with more recorded proof such as racism or homophobia, would make sense for more justice-driven platforms and charities to take them seriously 


However I do think women succeeded the political shit test of the late 20th century and as a result gained momentum over the ground of social issues. I feel like BLM is trying to emulate a similar tactic here.




Let it sink in, how women literally cannot even do decisions without someone always suggesting them something, which is why feminism is become the next big cliquish to arguably car or gaming culture

Be grateful for adversity.,"A lot of people here talk about generic redpill advice in regards to women, but I noticed that  the peace of mind and one's soul are badly neglected. Being a stoic is preached in the community but not talked about enough.

Today I wanted to share with you a stoic concept that helped me deal with the ""bad"" in life. It's called Amor Fati which roughly translates to ‚Äúlove of fate‚Äù, or ‚Äúlove of one‚Äôs fate‚Äù.

Amor Fati is the practice of accepting and embracing everything that has happened, is happening, and is yet to happen. It is understanding that the nature of the universe is change, and that without change we would not exist, we would not experience any of this.

How do we apply this concept ? By loving every single thing that happens, be it good or bad.

‚ÄúYou cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.‚Äù

The key here is to not only accept the bad things that happen but to love them. It might seem crazy to think like this at first, but the more you practice it you realise that it's your only option when it comes to dealing with adversity.


Your loving girlfriend that you had oneitis for cheated on you ? **Amor Fati**

You lost your job ? **Amor Fati**

You were making great progress at the gym and got injured which led to you losing all your muscle ? **Amor Fati**

Your best friend betrayed you ? **Amor Fati**

You went from having a big social circle to being stuck in self isolation because of a global pandemic ? **Amor Fati**

Loved one passed away ? **Amor Fati**

Realise that all the adversity you come across in this life no matter how bad it is will either crush you or make you stronger. Learn to love every single awful thing you experienced, are experiencing or will experience by understanding that it will sculpt you into the better man of tomorrow.",24,1
Why you should pace your lifting,"Before I start, I just wanna say I love lifting weights. It's the best antidepressant for me and gives me time in the day to be selfish yet productive.

With that said, there seems to be a destructive myth that you must spend HOURS in the gym at a time. Not only is this not true, I find it extremely unproductive to squeeze in more lifts than necessary, damage your muscles more than necessary, and just spend 3+ hours a day working out that you could be using on other productive things(studying, working, spending time with friends/family). 1 to 2 hours every day will get you much better results than 3+ hours 3 times a week. 

short but effective workout sessions will be long enough to be a nice break from the rest of your life, but not feel overwhelming. 

Make a schedule for different muscle groups

go the gym and work out that muscle group(s)

if you are done it may be beneficial to roll out sore muscles from previous days on foam rollers at the gym. 

That's it. You're done for the day. Go home, take a shower, do whatever needs to be done for the day, and come back to the gym tomorrow and repeat with a different muscle group.",39,1
Robert DeNiro Divorce,"I think these news reporters do a better job promoting red pill \ Anti marriage than any of us could have. If a wealthy, famous, respected, good looking actor like Robert DeNiro can't figure out how to make the marriage work then what hope does the average joe have?

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/10/robert-de-niro-cuts-estranged-wifes-card-expenses-actor-claims/

Actor Robert De Niro has claimed the coronavirus has decimated his finances and he ‚Äúmay only make‚Äù $7.5 million (¬£6m) this year, as he fought in court to limit his estranged wife‚Äôs expenses. 

The Irishman star‚Äôs former partner, Grace Hightower, has **claimed in divorce proceedings taking place in Manhattan, New York, that De Niro ‚Äúunfairly‚Äù cut her monthly credit card allowance from $100,000 to $50,000.**

Lawyers for De Niro, 76, say he reduced Ms Hightower‚Äôs American Express card limit because he has taken a huge financial hit as Nobu and Greenwich Hotel, two restaurant chains he has stakes in, were forced to close or partially close during the Covid-19 lockdown.

He also says he has been limited in his acting work by the virus. Caroline Krauss, his attorney, said a film project that he was scheduled to begin filming this summer in Oklahoma has been put on hold.

Ms Hightower, 64, a singer and actress, also alleged that she and their children had been banned from an upstate New York estate where De Niro is staying during the pandemic.

‚ÄúHis accounts and business manager says that the best case for Mr De Niro, if everything starts to turn around this year, ‚Ä¶ he is going to be lucky if he makes $7.5 million this year,‚Äù Ms Krauss said.

‚ÄúThese people, in spite of his robust earnings, have always spent more than he has earned, so this 76-year-old robust man couldn‚Äôt retire even if he wanted to because he can‚Äôt afford to keep up with his lifestyle expense,‚Äù Ms Krauss said, adding that De Niro has begun cutting back spending ‚Äúdramatically.‚Äù

Kevin McDonough, acting for Ms Hightower, told the judge at the Manhattan Supreme Court: ‚Äúthe idea that Mr De Niro is tightening his belt is nonsense.‚Äù

‚ÄúMr De Niro has used the Covid pandemic - my words would be - to stick it to his wife financially,‚Äù Mr McDonough said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a believer that a man who has an admitted worth of $500 million and makes $30 million a year, all of a sudden in March he needs to cut down [spousal support] by 50 percent and ban her from the house,‚Äù he told the judge.

De Niro, who married Ms Hightower in 1997, filed for divorce in 2018. The couple have two children: Helen, eight, and Elliot, 21.

**Ms Hightower has asked for half of De Niro;s estimated $500m fortune, despite a 2004 prenuptial agreement that his side insists limits her to a $6m apartment, $500,000 cash and $1m a year in alimony.**

**Matthew Cooper, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice, issued a temporary ruling that De Niro should keep Ms Hightower‚Äôs credit card limit at $50,000 a month** and pay her $75,000 so she can find a summer home for their two children while De Niro and his children from another partner remain in his three-house estate.",98,1

Do not become a victim,"I saw a talk from a billionaire, who spoke about the changing of who we celebrate in modern society. In precious eras we celebrated warriors, battle-hardened men who went through hell and sacrificed their lives for a cause. This changed following anti-war movements, and we celebrated brilliant creators, sports figures, who excelled at games and were the top of their field. This too, has changed. Now, we celebrated victims. The sexually abused, the mentally ill, the 'suffering' of others. This is of course not real suffering, which comes from intense physical exertion and pushing yourself to the brink, but simple existence, and the pressures of life. Maybe who claim to be depressed are simply finding out that life is what you make of it, and they make nothing.

This can easily apply to us as well, of we are not careful. You may feel sorry for yourself. Oh woe is you, you were beaten down by the blue pill masses, filled with little blue pilled thoughts until you nearly burst. Many see themselves as having been victimized. Raped if you will, mentally. This is the wrong mindset. You, in truth, have accomplished nothing.

Reading about game is fine but until you out yourself into the fire, until you test your physical and mental limits, you have not done anything. Do not ever feel sorry for yourself for being blue pilled. Do not be like them. They see their tribulations not as a badge of honor, but as a way to garner sympathy. They are rodents, swamp creatures who grovel for any bit of positive attention their whimpering can attain, rather than achieving anything. Not just women but men as well. Do not associate with these people. 

Many will also believe that they work hard, as they believe stress from life equates to effort. Anyone can become stressed, but pushing through it is what seperates the weak from the strong. Do not be weak like these people.

On The Societal Shift's Increasing Pace: Gen Z Will Drive The Stake,"**On The Societal Shift‚Äôs Increasing Pace**

An outward look is by no means a substitute for looking back and analyzing the past, but for those that have paid attention, one things is very clear: the decline is indeed happening, and more alarmingly, much much faster than we probably expected. It pays to look ahead at times in order to understand the environment you'll need to navigate.

For the younger readers in high school, graduating high school, and entering college, this post is doubly important for you, because you‚Äôll be around longer than the rest of us and this is the world you‚Äôll be living in. 

Know this: while we (RP‚Äôd individuals) are already a minority, YOU are likely going to be even more so as time goes on. It‚Äôs looking highly unlikely that TRP principles will ever become ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù in today‚Äôs society without some sort of immense catalyst among men at large. With how soft and emasculated men have become - and are still becoming ‚Äì a healthier society is a pipe dream.

Treat this post as a sort of follow-up/reply to the recent Just How Fucked Are We post, because we are indeed fucked.

**The True Influencer Generation** 

Shit is getting worse and worse, and with each new generation (which arise faster than you think) the pace increases. The next Generation following Gen Alpha (today's children) is well on its way. Make no mistake, we are indeed fucked. There's no fighting it. Take solace in the potential that some day we can look back on this ongoing fucking and we can put in a false rape claim.

Generation Z is the worst generation yet. Of the 3, the other two being Boomers and Millennials, there is no competition. I pity fathers of this time. 

One can ignore Boomers, and we're already dealing with Millennial bullshit, but Gen Z will grow up right in front of you with a sort of generational angst and entitlement that rivals and will outgrow even that of Boomers. They have more potential than any other generation before them to turn the tides of *everything* due to eventual Millennials coming into political power as a whole and setting them up for it, but it is far more likely ‚Äì pretty much 100% - that it will *not* be the generation to do so. Instead, they will likely no doubt erode society much faster and harder than anything we‚Äôve ever seen thus far. 

Boomers and their bullshit? Childs play compared to what Gen Z can do, and is likely to do. Millennials? [Shit, even Gen Z doesn't like 'em](https://i.imgur.com/M2iFNUi.png). 

Honestly, we who‚Äôve seen through the bullshit society tries to peddle are much more likely to end up in the positions we want in life. The only downside to the decline for us is the fucking decline itself. 

We‚Äôll get our money, bitches aren't a problem, and we set our goals and are setting up our futures for easy/easier living. Most of us love life enough to not want to fuck it up and just keep on living, no matter how fucked society is. Others unfortunately aren‚Äôt of the same strength or they did not come across TRP when they needed it most. Pour one out for the jaded crowd. The biggest issue for a lot of us is that it simply sucks that there are few like-minded men out there to build with due to this ongoing decline. We don't need some bitches to confide in. We don't need the poison known as ""true love,"" because we know it doesn't exist. 

We need others like us that ""get it."" There are few (relatively) that you'll meet, and even fewer that will stick around, but that's life.

Luckily for Gen Z, they don't have that problem. They were born during a time where the world is more at their fingertips than any other generation before them. The Boomers are dying, and Millennials are getting older and gradually entering the political system. Gen Z is set up for life, they reap the benefits and ideas of those before them, with less struggle and less hardship.

**They're Not Concerned**

I‚Äôm surprised there isn‚Äôt a National Hug Day or some shit due to how pathetic things have been going. Shit, maybe even National Kiss a Gay Person Day where we all band in solidarity with the LGBTQ community. Wouldn‚Äôt that be nice. 

When I say the kids of Gen Z are going to be the worst of the worst (Up until Gen Alpha), I mean it. Never has a generation been THIS entitled, and THIS ignorant of the world. With some of them being born with an iPhone in their hands since birth, it‚Äôs probably hard not to. Case in point? **TikTok**.


It‚Äôs one thing to not like social media ‚Äì I for sure don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs filled with retards who‚Äôll post the best 10 seconds of their lame ass day, and people smart enough to know the value in it; people who want to sell you things. [Both of these types people don‚Äôt deserve your time](https://imgur.com/hiIxQ2t) #TiktokBan #Doggo üòçüëå 

Yet still, Tiktok has blown up to such tremendous proportions that even Instagram and Snapchat have been eclipsed. Facebook is a thing of the past, Myspace is a whisper in the wind. Tiktok is the forefront, and it‚Äôs under fire from the US government, and has a chance of being banned in the US.

For those in the know, this is obviously for good reason; literal national security. TikTok is a Chinese app, with hundreds of millions of users worldwide. The user base? Largely teens and young people, apparently 41% between 16 and 24. Young and dumb, what a convenient combo. Anyone with any knowledge of the real world knows that anything out of China that garners such a large following, or shows such immense promise is an arm of the Chinese government ‚Äì you know, that shady ass nation that‚Äôs been a threat to literally everyone since‚Ä¶ forever? Lo‚Äô and behold, Tiktok has been confirmed to collect unprecedented amounts of data on its users through their phones, more so than any other social media app out there. Yes. Even Facebook. 

Well shit, who would have thought this shady Chinese app that blew up across the world is in fact shady as fuck.

""Yeah ok, sounds Tiktok is just another social media app, I‚Äôll just ignore it like the rest.‚Äù

Yeah, sure, whatever, I for one ignore it like the plague too, but it's so big that your sister's friend's niece will invariably use it, and somehow you'll know about it. Doesn't matter man, you're not Tiktok's target. This shit is by far worse for society than Facebook and Instagram at this point. The damage done by those two has already been done, Tiktok preys on the new generation coming into their own. It's Gen Z's favored social media by far.

Whether you block that shit from your own child's phone or not, it doesn't fucking matter. Gen Z is **ADDICTED** to it. They are FIGHTING against the potential US ban. It doesn‚Äôt matter in the slightest if YOU don‚Äôt fuck with the app, or understand the implications that its continued mass use entail. What matters is that [**Gen Z is ABSOLUTELY ENTHRALLED by it**](https://imgur.com/NqBwRU3). You‚Äôve got an entire generation of the shittiest of shithead kids ignoring facts and going off feelings, and [saying the absolute dumbest shit you'll ever read or hear](https://imgur.com/Abw3dHF), off a fucking confirmed mass spyware app developed by the Chinese government?

Sad part is that you probably can't even find the fucking video because it's just one in an endless sea of equally shitty 15 second clips all with millions of views themselves. [They quite literally do not know what they'd do without tiktok](https://imgur.com/wkwVVbx), even though the app released in the US only two years ago.

They say ignorance is bliss, and Gen Z is in their own world. Who knows what hell will follow, but I can tell you right now, even the youngest kids are already being molded by this. I've walked around nice quaint white neighborhoods here in NYC, some where I was the only black person on the street. Man, I don't think I spotted a single black person in Prospect Park just a while back when I linked with some friends. Riverdale, Park Slope, Cobble Hill real nice cozy places with fucking cardinals and bluejays in the trees, and overpriced pizza spots. Man, I feel bad even letting my eyes wander a little bit with how some of these fathers' daughters are dressing, and how some of their sons operate. 

**Disclaimer**: Make so mistake - 'cuz last time I said something like this, I some here say some dumb shit like I was shit-talking white people. Listen, it's 100% no better here in the hood. I'm with you on this. I don't think I need to tell you that shit hasn't been getting better here at all either. Only difference is that the hood has always been like this, it doesn't surprise me here. But in YOUR neighborhoods, with YOUR educated and well off neighbors? **HA.** You're blind if you don't see it happening. The only  difference is that there's no saving the hood or the people here that don't want to be saved, and if there is, I don't want to save them. I'm on my way out and I don't see myself looking back. It's not worth the effort. All we can do is watch the decline while looking out for ourselves. 

It's a sad parallel with Gen Z, it's a generation that cannot be saved and doesn't want to be.

Red Pill In Action: Relationship Advice Edition,"Women want an open man who isn't afraid to communicate, and maybe even share their feminine side. It's true because I heard it on the TV.

That is actually terrible. That shit will fuck you up for life. I feel bad for the guy. I really do.

Smart move. 

"" *However, about six months ago she and I went to a wedding and both got drunk. The wedding was in my family and something was said that - for want of a better word - triggered me big time and that, coupled with me being drunk, led to me breaking down in tears and telling her what happened.""*

Oh no, you dumb son of a bitch, tell me you didn't.

""*At the time she seemed sympathetic, though I did notice she became a little more...standoffish?? Like, she wasn't mean or cold or anything. She was just less forthcoming with physical affection and stuff. I didn't think too much of it.""*

There it is. And I think we know where this is going. 

""*The message thread included things like ""it's sad, but I just don't know if I can be attracted to him anymore"" and ""I know it sounds bad but I just don't know how I feel about being with a guy who got fucked by another guy"" and ""I just don't get how he let it happen, like if it was an adult I'd understand but it was another kid???*"" 

Aaaand scene. This one is over hoss. 

Remember, women are as predatory as the guy who raped this young man was. More so. And as all predators do, they have a radar that is constantly pinging for weakness. EXPRESSING WEAKNESS TO A WOMAN IS A DEATH SENTENCE, NO MATTER HOW 'REAL' THE SENTIMENT IS. Save that shit for your homies. 

This poor idiot probably thought his girlfriend actually liked him, after all they had been dating for a year. At least his initial instincts to not tell her anything were correct. But he got drunk at a party and started crying and expressing weakness, and not a month later this bitch is ready to jump on another cock. 

Women are not interested in you. They are interested in the character they have of you that exists in their head. If you like your woman, act in a way that allows her to maintain that character in her head. Do not express weakness of any kind, no matter how legitimate, to a woman. And lastly, don't get drunk with your woman. You want to have a few pops, fine. But don't get drunk. Frame control is extremely important. Nothing we don't already know.",168,1

The Importance of Training &amp; Drills During Covid-19: How a Japanese Guy Hit Every Target His Very First Time Shooting with Real Guns,"&amp;#x200B;

There is a lot to learn from this video, which I found utterly fascinating:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQDfwyUgtjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQDfwyUgtjg)

**Summary**: Liku was a Japanese guy who had never shot a real gun before in his life. He only trained with airsoft guns for 3 years in Japan

The thing is, even though this guy didn‚Äôt have access to guns in Japan, he drilled the motions. When he finally shot real guns for the first time, he was immediately able to hit every target since the motions were already drilled in.

One of the best comments I saw at the bottom of the video was:

 **Japan** \- great at teaching ""redundancy to perfection"", doing the same thing over and over again to try to get to perfection. 

**America** \- great at making peoples dreams  come true, reasons why people try so hard to come to the United States of America. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How does this apply to you?**

Lots of people are using the Covid-19 Pandemic as an excuse to sit around and be lazy. One of my friends is doing just that. 

You hear the same exact excuse over and over again: *""I'll just wait until things get back to normal before approaching girls or going to the gym...""*

Don't fucking do this.

Use this time to train your ass off so that once everything goes back to normal, you'll instantly hit every target.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why you don't need to go to the bar or mall and open 10 girls a day to get good:**

Some guys on here still believe that game is a numbers game and if you approach enough girls, you'll get laid. They think that they need that constant feedback from real world social interactions in order to improve.

This could not be further from the truth.

Truth is, game is mostly about value. What do girls actually look for? From my experience, they look at the overall package and like a female terminator, crunch the numbers in order to see if you're fuckable or not.

Race, Height, Muscles, Face, Fashion, Body Language, Social Calibrations, Social Status, Game. It all adds up. If you're short or Asian, you need to compensate in other areas in order to get past the line of fuckability.

Since raising your value past the line of fuckability is more important than spam approaching 10 girls a day at the local bar, Covid-19 is not an excuse to do nothing. In fact, it is your imperative to be like Liku and train the fuck out of everything in order to raise your value so that once everything blows over, you'll crush the competition.

&amp;#x200B;

**What to actually do to get good:**

1. Get to a low body fat percentage with decent muscle mass
   1. I understand this may be difficult if your State hasn't opened up yet. If you don't have access to a gym, this is a great substitute. Buy a door mounted pullup bar and dip bar (you can substitute with a Senior walking aid if you wanna be cheap). Buy dumbbells (for lateral shoulder raises). Buy a weighted belt so you can do weighted pull-ups and dips. Without progressing on weights, you won't gain muscle
2. Buy all your fashion items during the pandemic since companies are desperate to sell their inventory before shit hits the fan.
   1. This is a great time to upgrade your wardrobe. I always recommend rich white chad attire (navy blazer, beige chinos, white v neck t-shirt, gold rolex look alike watch, elevator shoes), but I'm aware that people have differing opinions on this. If you have a style that has specifically worked for you in the past, get more clothes of that style. Now is the time to stock up.
3. To work on Body Language, stand up perfectly straight against a straight wall. The goal is to feel no air pockets. Try to hold this posture for as long as possible. For most people, this means sticking chest out more and throwing their neck back more. It's normal to be uncomfortable in this new posture at first, but it is essential to be aware of this and fix any defects as soon as you detect them.
   1. If you can't fix it no matter what, buy a neck brace (the kind car crash victims wear).
4. To work on Tonality and Social Calibrations, watch old episodes of FRIENDS
   1. You'll notice how expressive all these characters are. You'll notice that every word they say is accompanied by the appropriate tonality in their voice. Try to copy them exactly. Word for word. Just mindlessly going out and having conversations with strangers won't actually help you improve. You need to practice with a purpose.
5. Game
   1. If you want, you can even work on game during the pandemic. It's a lot harder to get girls to come out and meet from Tinder and other Online Apps, but I found you can secure phone calls a lot easier. Here's what you do: You initially try to sell them on the idea of a video chat. Most will say no. Then you downsell them on the idea of a phone call and usually they will say yes, since they have nothing better to do.
   2. There you go, Free Game Practice during Covid-19.

&amp;#x200B;

I said it before and I'll say it again: **You don't need to practice at the mall or at the bar with real women in order to get good.**

Use this time to train your ass off so that once everything goes back to normal, you'll instantly hit every target.",26,1
Great rebuttal to a feminist," 

I don't usually write anything on feminism. I was scrolling around Reddit when I found this comment. In today's climate of extreme-left retardation, I thought it was an excellent example of how to counter a feminist with facts, logic and a calm demeanour.

Too often we see guys steaming with rage, bitterness and Beta-reactivity.

I was impressed. Needless to say, the woman he was replying to didn't answer. This guy pulled some secret special sauce of 'knaaawledge'.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*'In our patriarchal system, women are infantalised/objectified, meaning that they are not viewed as possessors of power. Men, in contrast, possess all the power, and, therefore, the responsibility'.*

I agree that women have been infantilized. I disagree that men have all the power. I know you stated this is simply your opinion, and you are certainly entitled to that, but opinions that are not informed by facts are of little worth. Your opinion lays the blame for the infantilization of women on men, and ignores the role women, and particularly the post-modern feminist movement (""3rd wave feminism"") has played. In the 1960s, feminists demanded change allowing them to face the dangers of life. For example, on university campuses women's curfews were an hour before men's, because it was considered ""dangerous"" for women to be out later. Women protested to have the same curfew, and face the same danger. They did not demand a ""safe space,"" but instead protested to be in the ""unsafe"" space. They wanted to be responsible, have agency. Today, feminists insist that if a man and woman have a couple of drinks and decide to have sex, but the next morning the woman decides she did not want to have sex, the man has to be responsible for his actions and faces rape charges. The woman cannot be responsible for her actions. ""Intoxicated consent is not consent."" THIS is the infantilization of women.

I question your term ""patriarchal system."" What evidence do you have of a patriarchy? That term means that there is a system in place where men are wielding power over women, oppressing them. Again, this goes to my original question - how are modern women in the west being oppressed?

*'Because men ""have the power"", male victims are often mocked, ridiculed, or disbelieved. The power/responsibility dynamic is where I see our societal issues with male disposability coming from: ""women are frail and need to be protected, but men can be sacrificed"".'*

I appreciate you recognizing that in terms of office politics, there is a power differential. I'm not sure, though, that the differential comes from a place of assumed female fragility, so much as an assumption of male boorishness. Hence, in the US, the Kavanaugh hearings were accompanied by the chorus of ""believe all women"" (because infantalized feminists insisted women need to be protected). Without evidence, a man's life was damaged, and his reputation ruined. This is the power differential women hold. Victimhood is a powerful position, and modern feminists have portrayed women as victims far more than men have assumed women are weak IMO.

*Feminist issues and men's rights issues too often come from the same place: inherent sexism rooted in hundreds of years of oppression.*

The very term ""oppression"" is a way of framing things that belies a presupposition of female victimhood, and denies women's roles in creating hierarchies of roles within culture. Innately, humans are driven to reproduce and continue the species. This drives all animal species, and much of their behavior is predicated on this - humans are no different. In virtually all species, the female has the choice of male suitors with whom to reproduce, and males compete for the females. Much of this is necessitated by biology: while the males produce millions of sperm throughout their life, and release hundreds of thousands with each ejaculate, females have a limited number of eggs, and are therefore more selective about breeding. There are exceptions (like the big cats), but this pattern largely holds true. Humans follow this formula. We see it early on: the prettiest high school cheerleader chooses the dominant jock on the football team. In adulthood, women will often choose the man who will be the best provider/make the most money. Again, this is a choice of the female, and this choice cannot be understated, nor is it fair to label it oppression by males.

My question about the supposed ""patriarchy"" goes back to an early question in this thread: if men have all the power, and women are victims of oppression, why do women live longer? Why are the majority of homeless people (by a 3-1 margin) men? Why are women entering post-secondary education at higher rates? Why are women graduating at higher rates? Why do women's health issues have more money devoted to research and treatment than men's health issues? Why are the majority of workplace deaths men? Why do we talk about a ""wage gap"" but never about a ""death gap?""

I'm glad you raised the question of women in STEM fields. An interesting finding in Scandinavian countries, where they have done more than any other in the world to achieve gender equity, has found that when men and women are given complete freedom to choose, they separate themselves into more traditional gender roles:

Again, this is by choice - not an ""oppressive patriarchy.""

*I would encourage you to do an analysis of the things you can see wrong in the world, and if they appear related to sexism, see if they seem to relate to that women=powerless (no agency/responsibility) and men=powerful (all agency/responsibility) paradigm.*

And this betrays the argument: a presumption of victimhood, and a denial of responsibility. Again, how are women being oppressed? If we must talk equality, how about we look at reforming education so boys can catch up with girls in standardized testing? How about we stop the idea of ""male disposability"" (and thank you for recognizing this)? Something of an anecdote, but it bears mentioning: Boko Haran, the Islamic terror group, became infamous when they started kidnapping girls. ""Bring back our girls"" trended on social media. Michelle Obama was photographed with a sign saying so much. The world cared, and denounced Boko Haran for this atrocity. What was never printed in media was that prior to this, these terrorists were murdering boys, slaughtering them by the hundreds, sometimes burning them alive. No one cared. No hashtags. It wasn't until girls were kidnapped that they were noticed. I encourage you to watch news reports and see how events describing atrocities involving children are reported. If a gender is reported, it is ""girls."" When boys are the victims, it is reported as ""children."" Again, it is anecdotal, but it questions the presupposition that men are oppressing women.

I'll include a couple of other links that you might find interesting concerning personality differences and choices, particularly in Scandinavian countries, because, again, these are the countries that have done more to establish gender equity than any other in the western world.",7,1
"Unless You Have These 3 Things, You Need to Give Up on Dating Apps. Here‚Äôs Why.","Note: I‚Äôm writing this on a phone so I forgive me for the lack of formatting. I‚Äôll correct this when I get to a computer.

So you‚Äôre having trouble with dating apps.

Many of us have been there before. You sign up for the app, get that sweet boost in initial visibility, and maybe even get a few fish in the net.

But then the conversation goes dead.

Or the girl flakes out on you and never returns your texts/calls.

Why is that? We all know these girls had a better option but sheesh, have a little more respect for your commitments right?

Not quite.

Recently I conducted the increasing infamous challenge of creating a fake female profile using a girl I found on Instagram‚Äîshe was somewhere in Israel to avoid any catfish repercussions for this girl.

Here were the rules:

1) The girl had to be good-looking but not a model. I chose a girl I would comfortably peg at 7.5/8 on a good day.

2) I‚Äôd create premium accounts for all three major dating app (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge) and would completely fill out each profile with pics and information to increase the authenticity of the profile.

3) I‚Äôd set the profile to BISEXUAL to get a good swath of results from both sexes.

4) I would only confirm matches with girls and couples who sent me a like. I did this purely for the curiosity of seeing how/if they would approach.

Now, this experiment has been done a lot and you‚Äôre likely already aware of the results...

Within 24 hours, I had over 7,000 likes on Tinder, 100+ likes on Bumble, and 100+ likes on Hinge.

Note: For Hinge and Bumble their counters stop at 50, but after scrolling through the end number was clearly higher.

However, numbers aside, I‚Äôm not here to tell you ‚Äúwoah man, girls get way more likes than guys.‚Äù

You already know that.

I‚Äôm here to tell you that after seeing profile after profile of guys and girls, you‚Äôre wasting your time unless you have these THREE things...

1) 8+ looks (minimum)

And no I‚Äôm not counting your body. Your FACE needs to be at least an 8. Be honest with yourself. This isn‚Äôt to knock anyone that‚Äôs less attractive but seriously, any girl above a 6 (maybe lower) has SOOOOOOO many more attractive options based in sheer numbers alone (more on that later)

2) Swag

I‚Äôm using this term instead of style or confidence because it implies both. Scrolling through dude after dude in all these apps, one thing became clear: 80% of these guys looked lame as fuck. 

1/5th were fat and out of shape. 1/5th were weirdos doing stupid shit like smoking or playing with their hair in GIPHY videos. 1/5th were clearly try-hards holding a dog in their hands. 1/5th were stupidly posed next to girls they weren‚Äôt dating (friends and relatives). And MAYBE the final 20% was a mix of interesting pictures of well dressed dudes or just conventionally handsome men in decent pictures not looking like goofs.

Keep in mind that in 24 hours, I had 7,000+ likes. In this sense it was virtually impossible for me to survey ALL of these dudes. At any given time I‚Äôd scroll through for 10 minutes and another 50+ likes would pile on top. 

As a result, from a woman‚Äôs perspective, the app is BROKEN FOR HER. The sheer volume of options is so overwhelming it almost makes you want to put it down.

This means she‚Äôll only ever see the top of her likes column at any given time which means if you do get a match, you need to come correct and take the conversation off the app QUICKLY. Very likely that girl will have another 1,000 likes in the next 12 hours.

In addressing your ‚Äúswag‚Äù you really need to fix your attitude. You can tell when a guy is trying to look ‚Äúcharming‚Äù or ‚Äúfun‚Äù or ‚Äúcool‚Äù and it‚Äôs just lame. Work on your style, have dedicated hobbies, and exude am aura of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine as fuck‚Äù without trying to pose like a gay GQ model. Just be cool.

And finally...

3) A RIPPED Body

I don‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve got a 2-pack with your other abs coming in next summer. I mean you have a well-defined 6-8 pack.

I don‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve got strong biceps but a bird chest. I mean you look SOLID. If you‚Äôre y‚Äôall and built even better. 

I mean this in the non-gayest way possible but even scrolling through HUNDREDS of profile photos at breakneck speeds, the profiles of dudes that looked tall and well-built stood out immediately.

If you aren‚Äôt tall, get built anyways but keep it proportional. You don‚Äôt want to look like a 5 foot Wolverine.

If you are tall (6 foot and above), unless you have model/athlete looks don‚Äôt be skinny fat or you‚Äôll just look like a gangly dork.

Moving on to Opening Lines...

Just say ‚ÄúHey [name], how‚Äôs it going?‚Äù

That‚Äôs it.

I cannot tell you how many dudes are leading with goofy or cringey shit like heart eyes and rose emojis, or just straight up beta shit like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so beautiful.‚Äù

Don‚Äôt be these guys. 

You‚Äôre goal is to appear normal; unaffected. Just say hello and banter back and forth for a bit before you ask for the number. Your goal is to take the conversation off the app as soon as possible.

Keep the conversation light but not boring. Don‚Äôt ask how‚Äôs your day going unless it‚Äôs leading somewhere. It‚Äôs boring and dry, and again, these girls probably have HUNDREDS of ongoing convos with dudes in their inbox. 

Be humorous but not lame. I know it‚Äôs a fine line but use your best judgment.

All and all, dating apps are statistically TERRIBLE resources for men where the likelihood of you being understandably ignored, forgotten, or neglected is extremely high. 

It‚Äôs why your matches are low, your dates flake, and your plates break, etc. Women these days just have WAY TOO MANY options where the slightest incompatibility will get you cut from the team.

So, what‚Äôs the remedy?

How do we make this current sexual marketplace work for US?

You need to hone your approach game.

I need to hone my approach game.

WE NEED TO HONE OUR APPROACH GAME!

That‚Äôs it. Period. End of story. The level of abundance women have in their youth is unreal. Men will NEVER have that mindset unless we make ourselves high value and develop the mindset and charm to be able to hunt successfully for our own food in the wild (I.e. pull a girl without a damn dating app).

So in closing, I urge all of you to start by talking to strangers. Even if it‚Äôs just to say ‚Äúhello,‚Äù ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your morning?‚Äù ‚ÄúHi I‚Äôm [name], ‚Äúhows your day going?‚Äù or ‚ÄúI like your shirt.‚Äù

ANYTHING.

Then work on building the conversation out: 

- ‚ÄúDo you live around here?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAny plans for the weekend?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúHow long have you been in [city]?‚Äù

Then make the ask [the goal is to simply ask]

- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting ready to head out of here but we should grab a drink sometime.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you get back to X but would you like to grab a cup of coffee next week?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúCool. I gotta run but let me grab your number. If you‚Äôre free next weekend I‚Äôm doing X and I‚Äôd love to see you again.‚Äù
- Etc. (Find a line that feels comfortable to you)

Special Note:

Of the 7000+ matches I got, I‚Äôd say about 95% of them were dudes and 5% were girls.

From that selection of girls, 60% were couples and girls in open relationships looking for a third. However, although I was expecting a bunch of butch lesbians, there was an interesting slice of 18-24 year olds that were at least 8s and 9s and feminine looking (all white).

Fucking FINE y‚Äôall.

Interestingly enough when I reached out to them the stories were pretty similar: they had never been with a woman before but were curious.

Good reminder that even hot girls that seem feminine as hell (no tattoos or red flags) can have a bisexual streak. 

Make sure your vetting properly folks! 

Bisexuality is a slippery slope to having a history of threesomes and throuple relationships. Good for plates, bad for LTRS.

TLDR: Unless you‚Äôre a top 20% dude, you‚Äôre largely wasting your time on dating apps. If you‚Äôre still afraid to approach, work on your looks (face), swag, and body.",39,1

Society weaponizes and commercializes men's sex drive and sexuality when it is convenient and sellable,"You notice how many people like to complain that us men are hypocrites about the slut thing because we then say that women are either too shallow or too conservative with their sexuality?


Ah! But see the funny thing, you think men also are not contested with their sexuality constantly? Think again 


Who remembers the show Jersey Shore? Now granted I only seen clips of the show here and there, but it becomes one of the themes behind the show was showing off sex or making it part of your identity I believe. It was also part of the show's identity to make you think of just chasing luxury.


Also, why is it men have to be more shallow with their sexuality than women if society really wanted to take the caution of male sexuality serious? Why are their so many labels to describe our sexual rank, yet not as many for women? Why does male sexual imagery actually incite stronger reactions (both positive and controversial) than those of women? Example, remember that Dolce &amp; Gabana add pinning down a woman? Or what about the Calvin Klein Justin Beiber ad?



See women's sexuality is sellable, but also be to be protected right off the bat if women want actually make it part of their identity, but for men they need to resort to more polarizing views of their sexuality and sexual condition due to sex becoming another social status tool, which not only reeks it out of its original purpose, being reproduction, but it also damages the intimacy of both parties regardless of sexual orientation. 


Men have to flaunt their sexuality, women can just be able to express whenever they want to whether is around social circles or corporations

My mom will have her leg amputated Because i was too busy masturbating/ fueling an addiction to save her.,"

Ill preface this by saying you should avoid porn like the fucking plague. Let this serve as a cautionary tale.

              

              Ive never quite felt this level of guilt before in my life i could have helped her but i didn‚Äôt. Before i share the epiphany that this experience has led me to, ill share the story. Ive been addicted to pornography for 7 years (heavily for the past 3). Which has in turn made my dopamine sensitivity so dull, normal women and normal experiences are beyond uninteresting, furthermore turning me into a robotic feminized shell of a man which has deeply affected EVERY aspect of my life.

Since my feel good sensitivity has gotten to such unattainable levels ive gotten into some (legal) but extremely weird stuff, ill spare you of the details but it was what i was watching when my mom was trapped against the lawn mower.

She was starting the lawn mower and set my 3 y/o little brother on the seat. As she walked in front of it, he kicked it into gear by mistake and it trapped her against the side of the house as the extremely hot motor was pressing against her leg. Again, ill spare you of the gory details but by the time i got to her, bone was visible.

As i was masturbating i knew i kept hearing screaming outside through my headphones, this went on for well over 3 to 4 mins before I realized she was in pain and not yelling at my brother. As she was crying she asked ‚Äúwhere were you?‚Äù. I called for an ambulance and shes still currently in the hospital now (this happened on the 7th) and the possibility of amputation is very much an option.

Amid all the bullshit attempts at justification and feelings of shame, extreme guilt, and self hatred, by chance i came across a post that talked about a young attractive man that was training to
Be a warrior when he had a smoke spirit appear in his room which would show him whatever he wanted to see and he obviously developed a porn addiction. (Great read, probably my favorite post in this sub)

It gave me an epiphany, a man who lacks will power and a set of standards and priorities is repulsive to everyone and especially women. Our badass ancestors never had the instant gratification option (porn, junk food, youtube, etc..) but today, we do,and so many abuse it which is detrimental to masculinity. Just as in the story i was a bright young man who stopped training to be a warrior and became a loser. 

A man should always have a mission and a set of priorities. A directionless man will always become a slave to whatever GIVES him a direction. Whatever does not produce light will always produce darkness. Without a compass or an end goal i drifted into becoming a depressed loser who gets constantly shit on by everyone. 

You should be a warrior who doesn‚Äôt falter from his mission (whatever that may be) and his moral compass. A good man would never opt for instant gratification (eg: shoveling fast food in your gullet) he would wait and drive home to cook for himself. In my limited experience women can read you like a book when your weak willed and directionless.

As a conclusion, id like to say im a quitting porn for
good and you should do the same. Dont lie to yourself, you know its horrible for your brain. Doing it just 1 time and hoping for the best is akin to licking 1 gas station toilet seat and hoping you dont catch anything. Avoid instant gratification like the wuhanFlu, it will spiral into something horrible. (Like letting your mom get severely burned). 

Thanks for reading, i know it is lengthy but this was an eye opening experience for me.",9,1

Get Laid a Tonne on Tinder [Part 2] ‚Äì Setting Up Your Profile &amp; Getting Matches,"Last week (well, 2 weeks ago) I posted Part 1 of my Tinder series, covering every facet of improving your looks, taking photos for Tinder/online dating, how to pose, etc. This week we'll dive into setting up your Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/etc, every single setting you should choose, using Boosts/Superlikes, getting matches, etc.

Most of this guide assumes you're either looking to get laid a lot, or find a girlfriend through Tinder. If you're more conservative or you're at a point in your life where sex isn't your priority, this isn't the guide for you.

Again, I'll just post a link to the full article at the bottom of this post. It's waaaaay too long to copy-paste all the content here (plus I can't post photos here). Here's some of the general tips though:

# Install EVERY app:

If getting laid isn't your number 1 goal, then you can get away with just installing Tinder and Hinge and not spending too much time on them. But if getting laid is something you're actively making a priority, then install EVERY app - go nuts. In the full article I've included a list of all the apps I use when getting laid is my main mission, but the top ones are Tinder and Hinge. Your mileage may vary (especially in other countries - eg TanTan is hella popular in Asia, Badoo is popular in Europe/Asia). Experiment and see which ones work best for you.

# Tinder Web vs Tinder App:

When you make a Tinder account, you should log in via the website (tinder.com) as well as the phone app. Tinder/Gold and Boosts usually vary in price between the web/phone version, so pay using whichever one is cheaper. (You can be logged in to the web and phone versions both at the same time).

# Swiping:

I do a bit of swiping/messaging each day, but only at a set time each day (in the evening after I've finished working on my other goals). This stops me neurotically checking the app 100 times a day and wasting time. You can also do what I do; use an app-blocker like StayFocused to stop yourself checking the app outside of the pre-designated time you've set. That app also hides notifications - it's awesome.

# Choose Bisexual:

When signing up, choose *Bisexual* as your Sexual Orientation (no, I haven't gone full retard... bare with me). Don't tick *""Show my orientation on my profile""*. But DO tick *""Show me people of the same orientation first""*. I do this so I'll be shown to, and see, bisexual girls as a priority. Those girls tend to be more sexually-available (and obviously down to have 3somes, which is something I personally want). If you want more conservative girls, or girls who'll sleep around less, obviously don't do this.

# If You're Over 30 but Want Younger Girls:

If you're over 30, by default Tinder won't show you to girls under 25 unless they go in and manually change their ""Looking For"" settings. By default, younger girls will only see guys in their own age bracket. So you'll miss out on a huge chunk of 18-24yo girls (who would happily meet you; they just don't know they need to change their ""looking for"" settings) if you set your age to over 30. If you like dating women over 30, then just use your real age. But if you're specifically after girls in the younger age bracket (18-24), then sign up with your age set as 25.

I'm a huge advocate of honesty, so I advise either writing, *""I'm actually \[your real age\]""* in your bio, or using the *""Don't Show My Age""* option in Tinder Gold. If any girls ask my age, I always tell them my real age - no point lying.

# Tinder Gold:

I advise everyone to use it; it just makes things a billion times easier. Tinder Gold lets you see which girls have already liked you, so you don't have to spend as much time swiping. You also get 5 superlikes a day, which do get you (*slightly*) more matches. And a free boost each month.

# Boosts:

If you're ridiculously attractive and have great pics, you won't need to use Boosts all that much - if at all. But for most guys, Boosts are pretty much mandatory these days. No point complaining about it (I know it fucking sucks), but you won't be that bothered about spending a few dollars when you're right in the middle of boning some cutiepie, trust me.

I've fooled around with all sorts of different days/times to use boosts. What works for me and most guys in Western countries I've talked to is (in order of effectiveness):

 \- Sat night anytime from 10pm-1am works best.

 \- Followed by Sunday morning 8am-3pm.

 \- Followed by Friday night 10pm-1am

 \- Finally, weekdays 5pm-8pm.

Again, that's in western countries - your mileage may vary if you live elsewhere. Getting laid is pretty much a process of experimentation to find out what works best for you, what you like best, etc. I don't purport to have all the answers.

# Bio:

The full article has a long list of bios I've written; you're welcome to steal one and use it. I also like to add height if you're over 6ft (if you're slightly under 6ft, grab some height-increasing shoes/inserts and then you can say you're 6ft). Add in your hobbies too, and general interests. Add in anything interesting about you.

Bio doesn't need to be mind-blowingly amazing; your pics will always be the most important factor. But a decent bio does help.

# Hinge:

Hinge is awesome because if you pay for the ""Preferred Membership"" for 1 month, you can message unlimited girls - **you don't even have to match with them first**. I usually only use Hinge once every 3 months - I pay for a 1-month membership, spam a BUNCH of girls (like 200-500) usually on a Sunday morning while listening to a podcast (8am Sunday morning seems to work best for me) with a copy-paste message. That'll usually get me laid at least twice, with only one morning's worth of effort. Then I let the app sit dormant for a few months (without paying for it) so there's a new batch of girls by the time I use it again.

"Instead of cooking like their mothers, they drink like their fathers. How luxury leads to downfall","Women love silly distractions more than men. By silly distractions, I mean those silly merchandises which vendors sell. As well as obsessing over lifestyles which include boutique hotels, fashionable restaurants, selfies, parties and engagements, drinks, cocktails, martinis, etc...

Now such a society where women lead such lifestyles are societies bordering on chaos.

The reason for this is simple. When a people become idle due to luxury and no longer have immediate threats, they begin to cultivate trade, grooming, arts, gastronomy, and other such things. When this occurs, they let their guard down and their society quickly sinks to decadence and then leads to a downfall. 

During the first and second world war, it was highly shameful for a soldier's wife to be extravagant and the virtue of duty and fidelity laid stronger stress on said society. Today this can be found in certain parts of Eastern Europe, the Caucuses, the Middle east and also Asia. In those countries, a man engaging in decadent practices is incredibly shameful and a woman can engage in it but in moderation. 

 In different ages of history, we can see how absorbed a people where in luxury and trinkets and how their downfall came not long after. 

\-------  The reign of Louis XIV brought in great riches to France but by the time of Louis XVI, the kingdom fell into complete disarray and it led to bloody guillotines followed by the rise of Napoleon. 

The Austrian empire likewise suffered from this when they expanded their borders and led a society where Viennese artists and businessmen enjoyed the high life while the Serbs and other peoples suffered. Similar instance in the Russian Empire.

And who can forget the liberal king of Iran? A man who got ousted by an Islamic revolution which implemented strict sharia law in a country in which the affluent were accustomed to go to nightclubs and drink copious amounts of alcohol. Likewise the case with Cuba before Castro's coup.

The Romans fell into passivity and had their capital transferred to the East and started relying on German mercenaries. 100 years later, they fell.   ------

Look at how the women were in these lands and times. Instead of interest in virtue, they threw themselves at a shallow lifestyle or as the saying goes ""Gone are the days that women used to cook like their mothers, now they drink they like their fathers""

Now in such a society, not everybody can lead such a life but it becomes increasingly desired. Status anxiety starts becoming prominent and everywhere one sees vice and luxury becoming prominent. **A young woman starts looking for what sort of man** ***can provide her with her ideal lifestyle.*** It no longer becomes about a good wholesome relationship but rather clout, status and pleasure. 

Many girls are left out due to the unavailability of rich men and they start resorting to shameful practices such as sugar babying, webcam sex, naked photo sales, boyfriend hopping, etc.... such are the nature of women in said societies.

All women are *Taken*,"Some recent asktrp fellow said he would never fool around with any bitch who was *taken*

To think this way is Bluepill indoctrination, because no woman over the age of 14 is single in the way *you* understand *being single*

When *you* are very single, you arent getting laid and if you do have relationships with women, they are using you for validation, attention, and emotional/financial support while you *try* to fuck them.

When a woman is single, its very different. She is lacking commitment from a high value alpha male. She has plenty of Dick and an army of orbiters. If she isnt *single* she has all that and a guy who thinks he has her pussy on lockdown.

He doesn't have any such thing. None of us do.

Its all a shit test. 

Get comfortable with the fact that men are single and it means they want sex and have commitment to dangle. Women are never ever lacking sex nor male company and if you want to be a ladykiller than the answer should be obvious

Raise your game so that *Your Commitment* is worth a shit. Then make women treat you well to get a taste of that deeply valuable treasure.

The Finger or the Moon?,"Whether or not you believe in the 2nd Amendment or not, the majority of us can agree that firearms do not float above the ground and start killing people. A firearm requires that a person pick it up, aim the gun at someone, and pull the trigger. We put the person who wielded the gun in jail, not the actual gun itself.

# Firearms are a tool.

Somewhere in the late 1800's and early 1900's, women suddenly started having a ""voice"" in society. Bear in mind this is the time central banks were installed in every major country including the United Stated of America (The Federal Reserve). Today, women are deemed champions upon birth and receive ultimate entitlement in modern society. The destroy families, they destroy men, they destroy nations, and they destroy lives, yet still retain more rights than the regular man.

Our idealized society in which women didn't vote was not so distant from the past. Men didn't randomly start giving women rights in the span of a few years when all throughout history women were treated as dependents. This wasn't a natural phenomenon, this was intentional.

Instead of looking at women and blaming them for societal issues, **we should shift our focus at the enablers**. The elite, the corporations, the politicians, the beta cucks, and the main stream media.

We can sit and theorize why women are the way they are, or we can actively maximize our strategy with this knowledge in mind.

# Women can be manipulated into tools.

By all means, **educate yourself on women**, but don't waste time blaming them and theorizing why they are what they are. A greater purpose lies beyond reading this forum 24/7.

"Ironically, other Women seem to like it when you disrespect other women.","(I‚Äôm extremely new to this sub, the red pill is in my mouth but I haven‚Äôt swallowed it yet (no pun intended.))

I have recently had sex with a girl I been talking to for a couple weeks. I only wanted sex and had emotionally groomed her for a week to get it, and then ghosted her afterwards. 

Needless to say, I did not have a lot of respect for this girl. 

Anyhow, I found myself talking to a female friend, and I was talking about my experience with the other girl. I was pretty much breaking down how I manipulated her and used her for sex and she seemed to really enjoy the story. 

She expressed that she did not approve, but the expression was buried under laughs and giggles. She smilingly said ‚Äúat least you know what you did haha‚Äù. It was just strange because this friend is supposed to be a huge feminist and you‚Äôd expect her to be enraged at a story about how her fellow woman was manipulated. But instead she sat with giddy eyes and enjoyed the whole story. 

Another instance of this was when I was talking with another female friend. She was asking me about guys and hurting girls feelings. I expressed to her that I don‚Äôt really care about hurting a girls feelings because her feelings are her responsibility and not mine. When I said this she laughed so loud it was weird. And she wanted to hear a story. I told her about the same girl and she, like my other friend, just sat and listened with Glee as I told the story about how I manipulated this other girl. After telling the story for what felt like the 3rd time even I started to feel bad for the girl but none of my female friends seemed to care. They all just really enjoyed the story....

Just How Fucked Are We?,"As many of you know, I've been a champion of the free exchange of ideas for quite some time now. My mission has been modest in scope, I don't care to save the Nazis or give a platform to perverts, segregationists, or trolls. While free speech certainly entails these things, they are not my passion and not my life's work.

I have interest in one simple thing: men's interests and their ability to communicate them with each other. I had no idea when I came on board the red pill train that this would be such a cultural battle, but the writing on the wall was quite visible as soon as I opened my eyes.

There has been a constant war against the free exchange of ideas. I am not a feminist, nor do I follow intersectionality theory, but there is some truth to the old saying, the enemy-of-my-enemy is my friend.

Men are not limited to any political party or race, but they find their interests parallel to certain politics and races in our current cancel and censorship culture. The tactics used and perfected against men over the past few decades are now hard at work against whites and conservative voices. You don't have to be white or conservative to be a man, but you absolutely need to recognize the tactics being used right now don't really care if you're white or conservative if your interests are even remotely tangentially aligned.

And don't forget the cries of the racist and political movements. It's not whites, it's white men. It's not conservatives, it's the ol' boys club.

The Red Pill as a discussion forum has always varied greatly by race, creed, and political affiliation. We have large contingencies from dozens of countries, many of whom have no relation to USA politics.

But today US politics and racism are being deployed in a global battle for our culture and internet, with organizational forces that greatly resemble the very oppression they pretend they are fighting. They know they're not really resisting oppression when they yell ""words are violence"" as they assault you to prevent your ideas from spreading. The occupation knows what they are here to do, and they just hope that the smoke screen they keep kicking up will prevent you from seeing the truth.

The truth is, the race, gender, and economic wars we are in are skirmishes in a greater war. Black people don't really need to hate white people, women don't have to hate men, nobody has to do any of this stuff. But for the power grab to succeed, they need us to continue fighting with each other so we never target the people pulling the strings.

The power grab taking place is one that's happened many times before, in many different ways, as countries in history have devolved into totalitarian states. What's unique today is the battle is taking place in the world's biggest forum, and the first of its kind: the internet.

##Battle for the Internet

The internet is a clever tool. In the early days there was a saying ""the Net interprets **censorship as damage and routes around it**."" (John Gilmore) This still holds true today. It is almost impossible to completely extinguish an idea on the internet. The internet is a hell of a thing.

The battle for the internet itself I think has mostly been ceded by the opposition. But it was a fruitful fight for them, with many casualties. Copyright law was weaponized as a censorship-cudgel that paved the way for future censorship. It was based on the plausibility that surely a crime as bad as infringement must justify a network of tools to remove items from the internet.

The internet nerds out numbered and out smarted those who tried to disappear things from the internet. The Streisand effect was coined, as many elites slowly learned that the more they tried to manipulate the internet, the worse it would get for them.

Organizations that tried to ""game"" the system as they used to with traditional media learned quickly that 4chan could out-game them in every way possible. Moot became Time Magazine's most influential person in 2008 thanks to his ""not his army."" Mountain Dew's new flavor, decided by the internet, ended up being a toss up between ""Hitler did nothing wrong,"" ""Gushing Granny,"" and ""Fapple.""

By 2010, it would almost seem as though the nerds had taught the world a lesson. Do not anger the internet, we are bigger, more organized, and smarter than you.

And that message was absolutely received.

What followed was a counter attack that is still in progress today that is overwhelming and wide-reaching, and may look like the final blow that ruins the free exchange of ideas forever.

##Male Speech, Conservative Speech, White Speech‚Ä¶ Hate Speech

The first and most obvious attack was an ideological attack. The internet cells of people who disagreed and launched the measures of the 2000s and 2010s tended to group themselves along particular ideological lines.

To prevent their power, they must be disbanded and made unable to communicate with each other.

Hordes gaming internet polls and amplifying Streisand events cannot take place in any meaningful way if large groups of people (men) are unable to coordinate and communicate.

It was already culturally popular to hate on men, thanks to decades of groundwork placed by Marxists and feminists in schools and public forums. So it makes sense that /r/TheRedPill was one of the early pioneers hit by the hate speech brigade.

Reddit was hellbent on removing unsightly elements from their website, and had gone through a number of test runs, removing borderline material involving children, which was a defensible position to take, but later moving into simply censoring ideas that were counter to the new narrative.

And that narrative was that **criticism of groups was the same as hatred.**

It was an easy line to blur. Men had no public allies. Anybody willing to be honest about the world around them was now labeled a ‚Äúmisogynist.‚Äù When they got cancelled from their friends, jobs, and lives, they had nobody to turn to, as other men saw the warning and quickly aligned themselves with the right side of history.

The phrase /r/TheRedPill was blacklisted on Reddit as a whole. Mentioning it would see your comment silently erased, as an attempt to prevent new users from stumbling upon the ideas we espoused and ultimately to prevent us from changing minds. Later, Reddit fully quarantined the sub, to make sure it was invisible to search engines and make it difficult for even members of the sub to access it.

Of course, criticism is not the same as hatred. But that didn‚Äôt matter. It never needed to make sense. It never had to stand up to scrutiny. The point was to repeat the word ‚Äúhate‚Äù enough times that the group inherited the attribute of ‚ÄúHate Group‚Äù by association, regardless of the truth.

And it worked well.

Once society fully swallowed the idea that masculinity was a synonym for hatred, it was a small skip over to conservatives and eventually whites.

I needn‚Äôt give a full history of the attacks on conservative values (though maybe I will in a long-form book at some point) but the blueprint was the same. Conservative values became hate, and eventually espousing the ideas was hate speech.

Pro-life? You hated women.

Pro-family? You hate gays.

Don‚Äôt want girls and boys competing in the same sports? You hate trans.

Don‚Äôt want illegal aliens to vote? You‚Äôre racist.

Don‚Äôt want open borders? You‚Äôre a racist.

It wasn‚Äôt hard to rebrand conservative values as hatred, the path was already paved and only required small tweaks from the anti-male movement that came before it.

The next step was to rebrand racial identity as hatred. And it really didn‚Äôt take nearly as much work as I expected. BLM reared its ugly head after an isolated shooting, and **it became publicly acceptable to call for the killing of whites on the basis that the only racial identity enjoyed by whites is one of supremacy and hatred.**

There‚Äôs method to this madness. As evidenced by Reddit‚Äôs actions, and mirrored later by Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, and every other social media site, the idea was simple: as long as perfectly acceptable positions can be framed as hatred, there is ample justification for the removal of these elements from the platforms and away from public view.

And it worked well.

##Build your own Platform.

The argument bandied around after each wave of censorship is probably familiar to you. ‚ÄúBuild your own platform.‚Äù It‚Äôs not censorship, it‚Äôs not an attack on free speech, it‚Äôs just capitalism. You can always just build your own!

This was an effective argument because it embraced the position of the right, who generally are strongly in favor of capitalism. If Twitter won‚Äôt let you do it, then just make your own. Why is that so hard to do?

There are a few hitches to this, however. And we will see that a number of companies worked in tandem, with antitrust and anticompetitive behaviors.

Gab is probably our poster boy for exactly why you can‚Äôt build your own platform; at least, not a twitter-sized platform.

Gab was a twitter clone whose main claim to fame was that they embraced free speech. If it‚Äôs legal, we will host it. (*except porn)

As a coordinated attack, they were shut down by every avenue that would lead to a capitalist being able to start their own platform.

* First, their hosting was denied and seized. They were forced to find new hosting.
* Then their domain was denied and seized. They were forced to find a new domain registrar, twice.
* The domain registry fought them on their TLD, they eventually gave up on gab.io and settled on gab.com.
* They were kicked off Google‚Äôs Play Store due to ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù even though you could just as easily find hate speech online through their own Chrome Browser.
* They were kicked from Apple‚Äôs App Store, which makes it impossible to load on an iphone because you cannot easily sideload apps onto an iPhone that are not on the app store.
* Paypal &amp; Stripe banned them, so they could not take payments via paypal or Stripe.
* Visa blacklisted the owner and his family, so they cannot do business with any credit card merchant on the planet, period.

This is an abridged history, but you get the point. Building your own platform, as it turns out, is pretty well impossible unless you toe the line. Though at this point, there‚Äôs a pretty good chance competing with the big guys will find yourself with similar issues, hate speech or not.

##Start your own Credit Card.

So where does that leave a new platform? Well, after having to implement your own tech infrastructure and having no way of deploying it to user devices, you still have no way to get paid, and therefore cannot afford to run the platform.

So what‚Äôs next? Start your own credit card.

I say this in jest because I recognize exactly how much work that would take, and there is still one major problem with it. Since these companies all operate with impunity and in anti-competitive ways, I fully expect this scenario:

In order for your credit card to work, people need to accept it. To do this, you need to create the tech infrastructure, get yourself licensed as a Money Transmitter in every state (which is a multimillion dollar+ venture), and then get yourself partnership agreements with the various merchant services companies that exist. There are a lot of them.

Once you do this, VISA will inevitably threaten the merchant service companies that if they do business with your new card, they will pull out. This, of course, would be suicide for any merchant service and so you would lose.

Crypto is an option that many saw as an answer to these problems. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs got widespread enough adoption to be viable, given the critical mass you need to reach with ‚Äúnormies‚Äù to be successful.

##So how fucked are we?

This entire essay seems a lot like doom and gloom. And in a way, it‚Äôs hard to spin it as anything but. The truth is, we‚Äôre in the shit right now, and there will be plenty more casualties before it‚Äôs over.

We are witnessing global power plays in real time, the outcomes of which will have long-lasting effects on all of our lives. What can we do?

I don‚Äôt have an easy answer for this, but I do have some ideas.

Critical mass social media sites seem to be running the show right now. Many people have enjoyed a growth in following that was virtually impossible in the days of conventional media. Getting thousands of people to watch a movie or a show was an expensive ordeal. Advertising dollars, gimmicks, actors, etc.

Today, a guy with some good ideas and some ingenuity can amass millions of followers. Each thing he writes gets exposed to hundreds of thousands.

This is giving away a level of exposure for private citizens that the media companies absolutely abhor. They let this happen on their watch, and they‚Äôre hell-bent on fixing it.

However, I think the social media companies are overplaying their hands. Reddit is currently on a crusade to remove all wrong-think, and in doing so they have angered even the communities they ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to stay. As of this writing, there is a mass exodus leaving reddit and never turning back.

And I‚Äôm working on one of them.

TRP.red and Forums.red are the life rafts I constructed to give my small corner of the internet a place to communicate when all else fails. Forums.red (as of this writing) is about to launch into beta in the next few days, and we will see just how much we need Reddit.

I think the answer to this problem is not to gather your followers on a mainstream platform, the answer is the internet in the late 90s: Decentralized, specialized, and numerous.

We may be currently unable to harness the power of big payment to create larger than life platforms that slingshot us into the sun, but one thing we can do with our current infrastructure is create millions of specialized forums and websites, each with dedicated topics and communities, sharing information between us in a Hydraesque-manner.

Centralization is the wrong answer.

Separate, specialize, and overcome.

Use accounts on major media sites to push people to your specialized sites. But do not live there. Do not depend on it.

Make sure your followers have an independent way to communicate with you (and you them).

They cannot attack all of us, and *they really can‚Äôt* if each of our properties is inexpensive to run and operate, and requires little in the way of donations or funding.

I recognize the irony in saying this as I developed TRP.red tribes as a means for centralization. I offer the TRP.red Tribes (and soon to be forums.red) as a meeting place, safe for male communication and thoughts, as a means of decentralization from the mainstream companies. But the dangers are still apparent if you gather on my site instead of others, so I will be soon implementing some big changes that will help with the decentralization of the internet:

**Tribe Portability**. I will be adding an opt-in only feature for users to be able to share select data with the tribes they follow so tribe leaders can keep in communication with their followers even in the unlikely event trp.red closes.

**Direct Communication**. I will be adding the ability for Tribe Owners to communicate directly with followers, without the need for followers to come back and constantly check the website.

**Forums.red**. As I mentioned here, forums.red‚Äôs beta is about to launch in the next few days, and we‚Äôre very excited to see how you like it. More updates to follow.

Stay Safe

*""The problem is, this drives her up the wall. She says I'm being reactionary, and sometimes (if I contributed to her being upset) that I'm being emotionally manipulative. But that's the furthest thing from my mind.""*  

He basically describes to us that his woman is repulsed by this behavior. As she should be. She's been having sex with a woman who happens to have a penis. She wants a man. A rock.. a stoic who can guide her emotions, not mirror them and stress her out even further.  

**The lesson here is quite simple:** 

\-Hold Frame. Learn what that means. In this case not because of a shit test, but even easier... because she's sad or upset. Don't get upset with her. Don't mirror her emotions. That is what her girlfriends are for.

i just had an epiphany after a blowjob,"I‚Äôve been reading and learning about TRP for about a year now and for some reason after tonight everything just clicked.. 

I had this girl i met from tinder come over tonight she was on her period but all i wanted was a good dick sucking anyways after a long hard day at work.

I can‚Äôt lie and say it hasn‚Äôt been a while (I live in Florida covid is fucking everywhere and i didn‚Äôt rack up any plates beforehand) so i was pretty excited to get my dick sucked after a long hiatus.

She was a solid 6 and a half and the only reason I‚Äôm giving her the half was because she had huge knockers.

We talked in my car for like an hour (felt like eternity) she just rambled about her whole life story she kept telling me how nervous she was because she found me extremely attractive and whatnot but I didn‚Äôt feel the same about her i just thought she had amazing breasts and a cute face.

After motorboating her tits for 5 minutes straight and busting a fat load in her mouth i felt.. nothing. emptiness. like i could have been doing better things. Don‚Äôt get me wrong busting a nut is a great feeling but after a minute of sitting there with my pants down i had this epiphany that women &amp; sex are great but there‚Äôs so many more things in life that are just flat out better. Maybe i would have felt differently if she was a dime but all i could think about was every other feeling i found better than what i just felt.

Hitting my PR bench pressing was a better feeling.

Learning something new that benefited my life was a better feeling.

Getting my paycheck every week is a better feeling. 

Idk amigos but after that blowjob all i can think about and wanted to do was improve myself. The thought of that and the thought of the man that i can become is just way better than sex to me. As I stated before sex is great but it‚Äôs really not everything. It‚Äôs just a dessert to your meal. An icing on the cake. But it‚Äôs not everything.

"Suicide note from alpha widow ""streamer"" who kills herself over AF\BB and liberal culture","&gt;I dated a bit, and I even started my first serious relationship. He is a really, really nice guy. Even when things went sour, he was always nice. Always caring, always there. 

He was like, literally a brother to her!

&gt;I ruined him. 

Are you here, reading brother?

&gt;He was raised right, and he was very good to me. I was not. Looking back, I don‚Äôt even know why I treated him so bad. A lot was just anger took out on him. 3 years later, we end things for good and on good terms. 

tldr; After turning this boy into a burnt out husk, he agrees to assume dust form and blow off into the wind so that she may devour her next victim.

&gt;This taught me a lot about appreciation in my life as should everybody learn about at one point in their life.. but I guess this is where Karma comes in.

Typical weirdo women shakra stuff

&gt;I **reconnected** with somebody else that I dated.. and I guess this is where the ‚Äúmain‚Äù part of this entire post is significant. I love this guy. I mean I really, really loved the guy. 

Ok, fess up, which one of you cretens was dicking this girl down?

&gt; But again, I could never be perfect. I was jealous, I was clingy, and I was very emotional. I was blinded by his changes compared to 4 years before that I just threw everything I had for the second time. I dropped all that I had and went for it. He promised me good things, I believed. I did not do any of this because of chasing love, but rather I viewed him as my best friend and somebody I really felt supported me in my decisions. This went on for a long time, the amount of trust was unbelievable.

She literally can not tell the difference between ""supporting her"" and not caring about her at all.  Because she was raised to believe that the most amount of autonomy and men agreeing with her, rather than guiding her, is what ""caring"" is.

In this regard, it is impossible for a woman to separate being a plate and someone who actually is cared for.  Because of course, who gives a shit what your plate thinks, right?

""Oh I'm thinking of taking out a 100k loan to stream on Twitch""

*Oh wow, that sounds like a really bold and smart move for a super smart girl like you... wow, go get her tiger.*

&gt; Don‚Äôt get me wrong, he‚Äôs a nice guy to his friends and family. Nobody ever believed me when I told them the way it was at home. I‚Äôve counted 3 black eyes, unlimited bruises, countless times of being thrown on the ground, and 4 times I was choked til tears. The fights were always about the same thing, me wanting more effort on his end

Wow, this sounds horrible.  What kind of monster would just not care about someone, have no motivation to do anything for her?

&gt; or being too clingy.. or saying things that he did not like. 

Translation : *He would not commit*

&gt;He‚Äôs amazing to his peers, there for them, will go out of his way for them. Very loyal as well.. but to me, 

Translation : *I was willing to share*

&gt;I didn‚Äôt even get 5% of it.

Translation : I was a maladjusted plate.

&gt; I am not perfect. I broke things around the house, but one thing I never, ever did.. was insult him or talk down on him.

Translation : *I instigated the fights and physical violence and he smacked a bitch*

&gt; I have been called every single insulting name out there besides my real name. I have been called Bitch and cunt so many times that I feel like it was plastered on my forehead. I‚Äôve got scars on my body that taunt me, and i wake up from nightmares all the time. I tried my best to not stress him out. I tried my best to watch my words and actions, I tried for a long time to be perfect.

Translation : His SMV was very high.

&gt; You see, nobody ever saw this. Nobody believed me besides close friends who would physically see the bruises and the times I cried for help from hurting so bad. Even after this post, a lot of you will not think any of it is true and ‚Äúshe‚Äôs just being dramatic‚Äù. I am in no way trying to make him into a bad person, he‚Äôs really not. In fact out of all his friends.. I can safely say that he is the most loyal and caring for them.

Translation : Everyone knew this chick was mental.

&gt; Depression is no joke. I‚Äôve called suicide hotlines several times in the past 6 months, I have looked into therapy and anti-depressants.. and I tried to reach out about it to him. He told me that I‚Äôm pathetic and to not bring it up around him. I was a crybaby, I sulked too much. I think this hurt me the most because he was my best friend and who I looked to for support.. but instead I was thrown away like I was invisible. I guess it just all got to me. In fact, I just texted him that I felt so alone that i wanted to end my life, and again, he replied that I am pathetic.

Translation : There is no psychiatric program for alpha widows.

&gt; And you know what, I am pathetic in many ways. I am not as successful or as intelligent as him and I sure as hell am not as strong. Til this day I admire so much about him. I mean, I really did care for this person. We had a lot of good times. In the end, it was all worth it.

tldr; I am RMV0 and have no self awareness

&gt; Although this makes him seem evil, I still don‚Äôt believe he is. It was only this way to me, and it was not always this way. I held with all I had to the last bit of what I felt I could take‚Ä¶ but eventually when you‚Äôre told that you‚Äôre not cared about enough, you begin to not even care about yourself anymore. If I could just pinpoint how I could stop making all this hurt go away, I would‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here.

Translation : After sleeping around a lot, I am incapable of feeling attraction to men who care about me.

&gt; Now I know what a lot of you are thinking, ‚Äú why did she depend her happiness over one person..‚Äù entirely not true. I would not kill myself over a guy. But could I feel more broken from what has happened? Yes. Could it exemplify my emptiness and open my wounds, yes.

Translation : I'm killing myself over a guy, because nothing else that has been sold to me as fulfillment has any value to me.  My dopamine receptors are shot.

&gt; Realistically, this post may seem like I decided to end my life over a failed relationship. That is not true. It may have contributed to depression but all in all, I just feel alone. I may have had spurts of happiness, but whenever things turned sour, I returned right back to where he put me.

Enjoy the decline...

&gt; But to be honest peeps, I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm hurt to the bone and I just don‚Äôt have any will power left in me. Please understand.

What do you think the chances are if we rewound her back to more simple times she'd have written this and killed herself.

Pretty much zero.

Stupidest shit I've read all week.  Liberals will handwave this as ""mental illness.""

This isn't mental illness, this is cultural decline.  She was a value system shift away from getting her life at least halfway sorted.  Doubtful she'd be able to settle down after the CC ride she's been on, but at least for her to be able to understand how to make real friends, get a real purpose in life etc and start building something of value for *herself.*

This was a life lost to cultural decline, I'm sure of it.  I'm not mad or sad.

This is just disappointing.

If this continues on, more and more kids in households that will begin or have begun in this forum will be addressing issues like this.

Just imagine having to watch your own daughter trainwreck her life for 10 years straight into the grave because everything you tell her to try and make her happy is ""misogynistic"" or ""patriarchal."" 

This was a very honest letter.  She framed it as ""his fault,"" literally an external locus of control, but it was honest as far as she could understand honesty.

Reread this letter and my commentary and you can see how the hamster, and narratives spin.

This was a violent basketcase alpha widow with an external locus of control who was emotionally bankrupt that any man worth his salt should be able to see right through.

Me vs. a class of girls and a female teacher,"My college is dominated by girls. Much less guys than girls carry on after high school in my town.

One day I was in Sociology. There were only 2 males in the room. Me and classmate. Everyone else was female, including the teacher so maybe 8-10 females in the room. Anyway, this was a few months back so I can't remember what the teacher said but we were doing about crime and the teacher mentioned something about rape to which I responded ""But more men are raped than women in the world...."" Some of the girls in the class burst out into laughter but I hadn't finished my sentence yet so I remained calm for a few seconds and let them have their laugh and I then said "".....in prisons"" and the class fell silent. The teacher then broke the silence and said that now that I've said ""in prisons"" I am probably correct. She asked if I had a source or any evidence to back it up and I said ""I don't mean to be rude but we have Google"" so she carried on teaching and I did a quick Google search and found several sources saying that more men are raped in prisons than women in America. My claim was that it applied to the rest of the world but even though it turned out that I was wrong in that sense, the teacher and the rest of the class accepted my argument.",1,1

Focusing Purely On Lifting Or Game Is Meaningless If You Lack Social Calibrations,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In sum, on the basis of this study, which includes a large community sample, we have reason to doubt that there are robust gender differences in whether and to what extent they perceive specific emotions to be present in the face.  
&gt;  
&gt;Men do have less confidence in their own emotional intelligence, including their own ability to perceive emotions on a face, than do women.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, this lower score does not predict their perception of target emotions, but it is associated with their stronger perception of trails of emotions that were not intended, or even not present. We should keep in mind, however, that the differences that we found were small, and therefore we cannot yet speculate on social implications of these findings.  
&gt;  
&gt;More research is needed on how men and women exactly differ in their perception of subtle emotion cues. We think it is very important to gain more insight in this process, because in most daily life situations emotional cues are not so clear and straightforward as in experimental research.

In summary, while men are the builders of the world, most guys don't stand a chance against a woman when it comes to social calibrations. Even a woman of average intelligence can read your body language and facial expressions and instantly tell if you're nervous or if you're trying to get something from her. It's inborn.

Everyone on RedPill loves to believe it's all Lifting and Game! Lift, Work On Yourself, and Approach Girls! That's all you gotta do!

The truth is, everyone is looking for that next shiny game tactic, or believes that once they can bench 225 lbs, every girl they approach will be receptive. That's simply not the way it works...

If you ignore the emotional intelligence, social calibrations, and body language, you will get nowhere. You see this a lot in people with Aspergers or Autism. They seemingly do all the right things: high paying career, lift 5X a week, diet in check, approach women, but still get bad results or bottom of the barrel girls because the majority of women are instantly turned off by their shitty social skills.

Everyone on here knows that words are only 7% of human communication. 7%.

55% is body movements, facial expressions, and hand positions. 38% is voice tone, modulation, and pauses. Only 7 motherfucking percent is words, and everyone is looking for lines on what to say to a girl. They have no idea that within 5 seconds of opening your mouth, the girl already knows if you're fuckable or not. Simply through your body language and the way you sound (how loud you talk, how fast you talk, if you sound like a robot or an actual human being).

Social Calibrations also involve reading the girl's facial expressions and reacting accordingly. A lot of guys these days play too many video games and can't read real social cues as easily.

Preparing for Success,"‚Äú*You were born to win, but to be a winner, you must plan to win, prepare to win, and expect to win.‚Äù* 

\-Arnold Schwarzenegger. 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Years ago I met a girl from Tinder, only the second time ever that I had met someone from the app. This was back in the good old days where you could have a relatively shit profile and still meet hot girls. I never would have met this chick in 2020 looking like I did then. 

I didn't have much dating experience, and I was nervous. Butterflies filled my stomach driving over. My mouth and lips were as dry as the Sahara. As I sat in the bar waiting for her, I felt that my heart would pound right out of my chest. 

She was much cuter than her pictures, still an HB8 in my book as I remember. Very charming in a feminine sort of way, not at all abrasive or boorish like so many girls these days. Lots of classic IOIs - compliments, touching me during the date, that tell tale twinkle in her eye, the whole nine yards. 

I felt like I was on fire. I was succeeding beyond my wildest dreams. After an hour or so, I offered to drive her back to her place. We made out a bit in my car. I remember what she said like it was yesterday. 

*You're really hot. And a good kisser. I want to bring you inside, but I don't want my roommate to think I'm a hoe.* 

I responded extremely lamely, something to the effect of ""next time."" Of course, there never was  a next time. 

Where did I go wrong? 

Obviously there are many Red Pill ways that I could have responded in that situation. Clearly she wanted sex, but she needed *me* to be the initiator. I fumbled badly, no question. But the root cause - the core reason why I didn't get laid that night - was that I didn't prepare for success. 

It's not that I thought I would fail. It just simply never occurred to me that this HB8 would be interested in me sexually. I had no real goal for the night, other than to just go out and see what happens. The thought of a same night lay was a concept so foreign to me that it might as well have been from Mars. 

Many guys on askTRP find themselves in almost the exact same situation that I describe. They know how to approach, they know some Game, they lift and look good. They get 95% of the way there, but they inexplicably stop before going all the way. They won't take her home, or they won't initiate sex in the bedroom. They snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, then come on here wondering what went wrong for them. 

If there's one thing that I've learned in my brief 27 years on this planet, it's that opportunities are extremely fleeting, whether with women, business, or whatever. What separates those who succeed with those who don't isn't necessarily intelligence, great Game, or good looks. It's having the presence of mind and the courage to reach out and seize the opportunity. 

Thumb-sucking, dithering, hemming and hawing. You snooze, you lose. You hesitate, you masturbate. 

What happens if she's really into you?  What happens if that customer seems interested? Are you going to *ask for the sale*, or are you just going to *go with the flow* and wait passively for something good to happen for you? 

The Blue Pill conditions you not to seize the moment. Growing up, most men are classified by society as Betas, and Betas are expected to behave in a manner congruent with their status. It's not that Betas dispute that you can meet a girl off Tinder or at the club and an hour later be in her pants, although they might. More commonly, it's that the thought *never even occurs to them.* 

Yes, you fucked up by not inviting yourself into that Tinder girl's apartment. You shat the bed when you asked for that club girl's number instead of bringing her back to your place. We can point to those errors as the proximate cause, as they say in the law. But the real reason is that you didn't prepare to win. 

Prepare for success, and you will be ready to seize the opportunity.",32,1
RPU Episode 13 - Game: Part 3 July 7th at 9PM EST,"#[RPU Episode 13 - Game: Part 3 July 7th at 9PM EST](https://youtu.be/VM6Q5RAAumk)

This week we continue laying down the framework for building confidence through competence with an emphasis on Qualification and Disqualification.

Qualification is arguably the most important long-term aspect of Game as it screens for women who are a good match, drives investment, combats ASD, and demonstrates you are demonstrating interest in more than just her looks!

Qualification is the crux of building rapport and is what allows for physical escalation. Much of this will be using hoop theory as an easy to follow framework. In essence we raise our mere-exposure effect, and their investment in us, by introducing compliance tests and rewarding that compliance with good feelings and escalating levels of physical contact and intimacy. 

Hoops come in all sizes and complexity, examples of which will be given during the show.

Why MGTOW is not the way out/Why TRP is the better option.,"I was actually banned from this sub...don't remember how long ago. I have conflicting views with at least someone here, and honestly I do not care, I even started my own sub, big deal. Anyway, to the point, I lurk around here every once in a while to catch up on anything ""new"" and sometimes go into the MGTOW sub to see what is new there, and there are several distinct differences in attitude between the two camps.

Now before we ruffle anyone's sensitive feathers, let me preface with the simple fact that your life is your choice, do what ever the fuck you wan't and pay the price for the consequences. At least if you do this, you are already proving that you have a penis and are genetically, and fundamentally, male. Why? Even if you lack mental agency, the physical act of taking life on the chin will never escape men. That is just how it has always been. Make a choice, follow through, deal with the consequences. Something women, never, and will never, be able to do. Hell they can't even make a choice let alone do the rest. Okay, let's move on.

I have been diving into stoicism A LOT over the past 6 months. I feel like it is personally the right way to look at things in this world IF your life goal isn't pleasure of the body, but rather, pleasure of the mind and spirit. But, using its logical approach I have made a an inference that I fell like the majority of people over at MGTOW never make. And that, is the simple difference between them, and TRP. Hell, its a difference between them and blue pillers. What is that difference? TRP offers a solution. There was a person recently who was trying to prove to me that MGTOW is a solution to a lost battle. What I have always liked about TRP, is that no matter what the problem, it is never a lost cause and there is a way out, there is a solution. Be it mental, physical, spiritual, the fundamental goal of TRP is offer as much insight into the how the social dynamic between men and women works so that we can find solutions to common problems. TRP is not for quitters. TRP is not for weaklings. It's for those men that do not want to give up, refuse to be defeated, and even in the absolute worst situations will strive to find a way to turn profit for themselves (not necessarily monetary).

Someone who has wen't MGTOW may say something like ""well my choice is to abstain from said practices and focus on self preservation"". Then you are no better than a woman, except your approach is passive, while her's is active. It isn't necessarily a bad choice, after all, do what ever you please, but here is my point of view and why MGTOW never fully appealed to me. The slogan itself is great, men going their own way. But just like ""black live's matter"" went from slogan to communist/liberal organization focused on shoving its own mantra down everyone's throat, so did MGTOW become yet another mantra that if you don't accept, you may as well leave. Going your own way (at least back when I first found it) meant every man was looking for a solution using their own brain, and funny enough TRP was along side it always offering solutions.

Now I am definitely no alpha male getting laid like a warlord out there. I have my own beliefs and opinions, but I do appreciate the fact that there is at least ONE group of people who are trying to break things down in as much a scientific way as possible to form theories and solutions.

The next difference is the level of anger. Red pill rage is common, and the more hurt a boy got, the more angry he will be. The difference between MGTOW (and the proof is in all of their comment sections) and TRP, is that TRP teaches to push passed it, and go back out to the battle field with new weapons and armor. MGTOW comments are full of men who have never pushed passed their anger. They go to work and see a woman and immediately approach any interaction with her with prejudice, disdain, and anger. ""She is one of them"". Sure, I am not denying that in the end all women are extremely similar with slight variations here and there. But there is honestly no reason to be angry all the damn time about it. Just how stoicism teaches that emotions are important, it also teaches that one should approach emotions from an outside point of view, and see if there is any benefit from them. If your anger is neither helping nor hurting you, it is a waste. 

TRP always says to use that anger as a source of motivation to counter attack, to hit the gym and to go improve in everything one can and as one improves, their life will fill with other more important things, and that anger will no longer be necessary. Yet one of the MGTOW guys (and I am quoting his words) "" My anger is meant for MY survival first&amp;foremost, my Survival is more important. "" Cool. His anger has gotten him absolutely nowhere, because using plain, calm logic, one can do the exact same thing.  I always advocate for men to be as efficient as they possible can, and cutting out wasteful emotions that bar you from evolving. Emotion is EXACTLY what got us wrapped up in this bullshit in the first place. ""Love"" and ""Attraction"" from a blue pilled perspective will just get him divorce raped. Look at them logically and one can use them towards their advantage.

I know I probably am not stating anything new. But, I know I have talked to several new guys who keep asking me, ""what is the point of TRP if I can just go MGTOW"". It's because one is an ideology and the other is a book of problems and solutions. MGTOW says ""I can't fail my math class if I just don't sign up for it"". TRP says ""I will only fail my math class if I don't learn and practice"".

3 simple tips to ensure a good night's sleep," (skip to the first part if you are not interested in my story)

I have been suffering from insomnia when I started college in 2015. I had to wake up at 6:00 everyday to catch the bus and then get back home at 20:00 the earliest. Dine, play some videogames, do some homework or whatever, and it is already midnight. I try to sleep and I only close my eyes around 1:00. Sleep for 5 hours and then wake up the next day. It was a living hell, but I survived with damages. The damage being not being able to sleep for more than 5 hours, and most importantly, unable to go to sleep easily.¬†

I have been frustrated with it a lot, and I tried everything you could think of, from sleeping pills, to meditation, to developing a sleeping routine, and so on, but nothing worked. Some even backfired. I remember I started abusing sleeping pills at some point and it was a very bad experience, to say the least.¬†

And so, I started regarding the whole thing from a different angle. I experimented with my body A LOT and I finally came to understand the REAL variables that DO AFFECT my sleep, and they change from one person to the other, depending on your genes, developmental history, and so on.

So without any further ado, let's jump to the first tip!

#### 1. Eliminate any alarming/sedative substances. 

For me, those are caffeine and nicotine. For others it could be weed and alcohol. Whatever it is, just eliminate it.¬†¬†

I never knew that my body was that sensitive to drugs until I quit snusing/smoking and drinking coffee. My worst sleeping nights are the nights when I get nicotine in my blood and drink coffee in the morning. I tried a few sedative pills before and their effect was even worse, in that I would feel lethargic the next day.¬†

Quitting coffee and cigarettes was difficult, but it had the best results I have ever experienced thus far. This advice might be cliche, and I have read it everywhere on the web that you need to stop drinking coffee or smoking cigarettes 6 hours before sleeping or whatever, but that never worked for me. What worked for me was to quit them once and for all. So quit your substances.

#### 2. Reschedule you biological clock¬†

This is also something I found in one of the comments on some Reddit post on how to sleep better, where the reddittor is a backpacker who travels across the globe and always has troubles readjusting his biological clock to the country of residence. It might take him a few days if he does not do the following the method, but he finally figured it out. And this also helps with sleeping a lot.

Assuming you go to sleep between 22:00-23:00, stop eating food and drinking water between 14:00-16:00. Unlike a myriad of posts on the internet, what really determines your wakefulness is not the amount of light reflected on your retina, but the time when you are eating food. The logic behind this is that you are telling your body when to wake up and find food and when to go to sleep because there will be none. The same way your brain needs sleep to process the information, your tummy needs as much rest.¬†

He also recommended that you eat a good nutritious voluminous dish first thin in the morning that you will fill you up for the upcoming couple of hours and around lunch to just grab a few snacks here and there and drink a lot of water and call it a day. If you do this for 3-5 days, your body will readjust accordingly and falling sleep at night will be easier.¬†

I have personally tried this and it worked like a charm. And I noticed that not eating will automatically make me tired and that helps tremendously with sleeping. I never feel hungry at night because I was raised in a household where dinner is served at 17:00 so I never had any issues staying full.¬†

But with a lot of you, I am sure you will feel hungry at night and my advice is to fight the urge to eat at that time for a few days and it will disappear eventually for reasons that might require another post to explain.¬†

#### 3. Drink multivitamins¬†

Minerals and vitamins are as important to fall asleep as a good pillow and a bed. Unless you're going full ADHD on your mineral intake, you will always be in deficit, and that is not a huge problem per se. It will not affect you on the long run, but it does affect your sleep. So just make a trip to the grocery store and pick a multivitamin tablet and drink a pill everyday when you wake up, and it should help you falling asleep.

#### Things to bear in mind

* Not sleeping at night does not automatically mean that you will not be able to survive the next day.

Probably one of the things that hindered me from sleeping the most was the belief that if I do not sleep tonight, I will not be able to function at full capacity the next day. The irony in this is that I have been sleep-deficit my entire life and have achieved a lot.¬† However, the day I accepted that not sleeping enough will not affect my academic and professional performance is the day I started sleeping better and excelled even more at my job.¬†

* Compensate for the missing hours of sleep by taking a 30-minutes nap at some point of the day

If I do not sleep enough at night for some reason, around 14:00 I will find myself falling asleep and I usually put the timer to 30 minutes. After exactly 30 minutes, I would wake up fresher than ever and carry on with my life.¬†

* Do whatever you can to make yourself sleep better¬†

For me, I bought an old school clock with that ticking sound and placed it right next to my head. Growing up, there was an old big clock in the hall at the center of the house, and I could hear its ticking every night I went to sleep and now it usually helps to have a clock ticking around like hypnosis. It drives some people nuts, but for me it is always a plus. Figure out your own sleeping habits and do them.

Crucial Life Lessons From A Billionaire‚Äôs Superyacht,[removed],2,1
"""The Spirit Of Seeing"" - A Story About The Internet","*‚ÄúHe‚Äôll do great things that boy..‚Äù*

That‚Äôs what the village people said about him. Strong, co-ordinated, talented, smart and charming. The young man felt as though he could become anything he wanted.

He stood tall with his shoulders back and his blue eyes spoke of a steady self-confidence held deep within him. His body was strong, built through hours of intensive sword training.

After endless hours of sword practise, he began to scroll through the village back to his home. A number of girls waved to him as we walked by and he politely waved back.

Upon arriving home, he began sharpening his swords ready for training the next day.

Suddenly, a spirit appeared behind him, calling his name. The young man spun around ready to attack, only to find an incredibly plain looking spirit floating harmlessly in the centre of his room.

Neither male nor female, the spirit held an entirely blank expression. Neither happy nor sad, as though there was no emotion inside it whatsoever. The spirit spoke *‚ÄúJean of Furthershore, I am the Spirit of Seeing‚Äù.*

The young man stood facing the spirit confrontationally. *‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù* he said drawing his sword. The spirit remained completely unafraid.

*‚ÄúOnly to show you my powers. I can show you anything you can possibly imagine. For I am the Spirit of Seeing‚Äù*, the spirit replied plainly.

The young man observed the spirit carefully. It continued to float passively in the air and seemed to pose no threat. *‚ÄúYou can show me anything huh..? Show me..the stables of Furthershore‚Äù* the young man said curiously.

The spirit blew a puff of smoke, and inside the smoke the stables could be seen clearly. The image of the stables hung in the air for several moments before disappearing.

The young man smiled. *How interesting,* he thought to himself. Another idea immediately came into his mind, *‚ÄúShow me the most beautiful girl in the world‚Äù* he suggested with a smirk on his face.

Without a word, the spirit blew another puff of smoke, and in it appeared the most beautiful girl the young man had ever seen. Her long, dark hair lay delicately over her pretty head. She had big, piercing brown eyes, a delicate nose and plump lips. One hand lay perfectly on the hips of her gorgeous hourglass figure.

The young man‚Äôs pupils dilated as he stared at the girl in wonder for a full five minutes.

Remembering where he was, he cleared his throat and composed himself once again. While he felt slightly embarrassed, the spirit maintained and empty gaze seemingly unaffected by the young man‚Äôs embarrassing display.

Another idea entered the young man‚Äô‚Äôs mind. *‚ÄúShow me a great warrior‚Äù* he commanded. As usual, the spirit blew yet another puff of smoke with an image of exactly what the young man had asked for. The perfect warrior stood looking into the distance, his body toned and muscular, with a stern expression on his face.

The young man marvelled at this great warrior, pledging to himself that he too would one day be a great warrior just like this man.

The young man had had enough. *‚ÄúYou may leave now spirit. I have seen enough‚Äù*, he said dismissively as he went back to sharpening his swords.

The spirit of seeing spoke without emotion: *‚Äú I shall remain here in the corner of your room, ready to show you my powers on your command‚Äù.*

The young man shrugged his shoulders in acceptance. The spirit didn‚Äôt seem to mean him any harm.

As the weeks went by, the young man became accustom to the spirit in his room. He used it to see the weather of the day, to see what his friends were doing and he even started looking at beautiful girls with their clothing removed ‚Äî after all, the spirit of seeing would show him *anything* he wanted.

**The weeks turned into months.**

He started leaving his sword training an hour early. And then two hours early. And then three. For the spirit of seeing was far more stimulating than dull, repetitive sword training.

The girls in the village waved, but the young man stopped waving back. They were plain, he said to himself. One day he would find a girl as beautiful as the ones he watched through the spirit, he thought.

He began using the spirit to watch great battles. He cheered aloud as his favourite hero turned the tide of the skirmish at the very last minute. Watching with eagerness, thinking that one day soon he would lead his own army into battle.

He thought of these battles while he practised his sword-work. He even began reciting lines he had heard his favourite hero speak as he swung. And he would leave training after just a few hours to rush home and watch another great battle (Not before seeing more beautiful naked girls, of course).

**A year past.**

And the girls in the village had stopped waving. Some had wedded a husband. Most could be heard screaming the name of another boy in the village from the archery range each evening. Apparently he was skilled with a bow. The young man cursed and muttered under his breath ‚Äî something about real warriors not attacking from afar.

He now often trained only for a few short hours and some days he would skip training altogether. He would walk at a quick pace through the village to get home, uninterested in exchanging pleasantries with the village folk.

He had begun using the spirit to watch as a number beautiful naked women perform sexual acts upon one another. It seemed now that a single naked woman was no longer interesting.

His admiration for his favourite hero had turned into jealousy. He would watch the hero defeat enemy after enemy, the gap between himself and the hero seeming to loom ever larger.

He could no longer run much of a distance. His shield felt heavy. His sword skills no longer matched other warriors of his own age.

**Several more years past.**

The young man had given up on becoming a hero, although he would still re-watch his favourite battles through the spirit from time to time. Still unmarried he had become deeply frustrated and sad. His sword lay quietly in the corner of the room collecting dust.

On the night of his 30th birthday, the middle-aged man sat alone in his room feeling worse than he had ever felt.

The clock struck 12.

Suddenly, the spirit of seeing began to laugh. The man was startled, the spirit had never laughed before. In fact, it had never shown any emotion whatsoever. He looked up at the spirit who caught his gaze. Slowly, the spirit of seeing grew a wide smile.

For the first time in 10 years, the spirit spoke. *‚ÄúMy work here is done‚Äù* it said in a deep voice.

*‚ÄúWhat are you talking about spirit?‚Äù* the man spoke fearfully.

The spirit laughed again. *‚ÄúI shall reveal what I have kept secret for the past 10 years. I am the ultimate concentration of evil. I am root of all the darkness in the world. I am the devil himself‚Äù*, the spirit spoke pridefully.

The man became terrified. His mouth wide open and speechless.

*‚ÄúA demon will attack this village tonight. A prophesy foretold that you were the one destined to defeat it. But it is I that has defeated you. And now the souls of this village are mine‚Äù*, the spirit spoke with a tone of utter glee.

*‚ÄúWhy wait ten long years?‚Äù* , the man spoke with a shaky voice, *‚Äúwhy not fight me face to face the first time we met?‚Äù*.

The spirit let out another laugh. *‚ÄúIf I had faught you face-to-face, you would have conquered me. But I am cunning, and the slow drip of poison given to you through the means of endless fantasy has rendered you too weak to fight. And now this village is mine‚Ä¶‚Äù*

The man could do nothing other than slowly sit down onto the bed. A deep, dark pain settled inside his stomach. One that he knew would never go away. Only the devil himself could inflict the deep, tormenting inner anguish he felt pulsing through his mind.

The torture in his mind was too much to bare. He needed something to quell the pain.

*‚ÄúCan I see those beautiful girls just one more time?‚Äù*

A wide grin grew across the devil‚Äôs face. *‚ÄúAlways‚Äù.*",103,1

Are red pillers really winners?,"I don't think so.

So, what can a red piller get? Unlimited sex? Absolutely.  Confidence? Absolutely, in gender relationships. Not necessarily in other areas. I consider them close to irrelevant. Immunity from the mental abuse from women. And minimizing the effects of the scams from women. These are all created by women.

What a red piller has to pay? Going to the gym. Earn high income. Learn to game. Learn to avoid suffering from the shit-test, false rape accusations, shaming from women and other men, discrimination from the society. Pay for the date, tax to support women, pay larger portion for the family if you are getting married, etc. I am not saying some of these activities are not good by themselves, but it's still a price to pay.

What about betas? They pay much more price but get no sex.

I know red pillers are doing much better than betas. Congratulations on the effort and the results. Red pillers are lucky, without a doubt.

However, women get all these advantages of red pillers, unlimited sex and confidence, while without paying any price. They just need to be women.

The best a red piller can get is only to proximate a woman, but with lots of price. A man has to be lucky to get out of these. While women can perform their scams every day without being accused.

Which means, a red piller may be winning against the betas, under the assumption that red pill is a better lifestyle than blue pill. But red pillers are probably losing against women, or a draw at best.

This subreddit is being repressed for no reason, but nothing red pillers can do about it. Just admit it, women are not just shit-testing, or just shouting without real effects. They get lots of political power and social power, much larger than red pillers. Women are political animals by nature, they know how to play the game, and men, including the red pillers, are losing the game. You can never win a woman. Even if luckily enough, your son wants to be a red piller, he still has to pay the price as well.",36,1

It all finally makes sense - all the terms and phrases in TRP arent separate entities that you juggle in your head and try to remember. They all fall under one single mindset.,"**Intro** This is NOT about abundance mentality. This is a nuanced point about how even if you have an abundance mentality, you'll still continuously fuck up if you don't have it in conjunction with a buyer's mentality. You can deep down know, ""oh there's always more girls out there"" while still not talking to girls as if you are the buyer


**Main**

Ive been on TRP since almost the time it started. I read up the side bar and knew concepts like ""amused mastery"", ""treating ur gf/date like a bratty little sister"", ""your time is valuable"", etc but this entire time I viewed them as separate terms.


===============================================


*I went on tinder and thought, ""okay remember, treat her like your bratty sister. And be cocky funny""*


===============================================


**Epiphany**

It wasn't until recently that I realized all these terms and phrases and ideas fall under a SINGLE mindset - **that you are the buyer.**


Similar to ""you are the prize"" - except this mentality can lead men to act like dumbasses, saying whatever stupid shit that comes to their mind because they believe their 120lb or 300lb ass is some gift from god. This is NOT it.


You are the buyer means that you are out there in the dating market, as an intelligent, rational, practical selector of who you will choose to give up your time, money, and attention to.





I'm sure people are rolling their eyes thinking, *""duh bro, thats so obvious""* but i guarantee you most TRPers don't truly get this.


For example, when people tell you, ""don't txt back right away, don't use too many emojis"", **the most common** cited reason is cause you look desperate and effeminate. Although those are important reasons, those explanations don't hit the main reason - **which is that you no longer are in a buyer's mindset. **


===============================================


Think about it this way: You being the seller stops at health, hygiene, social life, and finances. THATS &gt; IT. You no longer are the seller past that point. Meaning that every interaction you have with a girl is &gt; from a standpoint of seeing if the girls good enough for you.


WHY would an outstanding product such as yourself be so eager to want to text one girl? Why would an outstanding product send a bunch of emojis and secretly deep down wishes she'd text back?? By virtue of doing those actions, your brain no longer believes you are the one who chooses. And when girls start picking up on this, they realize you're not the amazing product they initially believed.


===============================================


And because YOU are the buyer, it makes sense to be more discriminatory in online dating. It's not your job to amuse the girl into agreeing to a date with you. Its her job to sell her girly cuteness to convince you fuck and date her. She's the one who should be wondering, ""am i doing this right? should i text him again? What if he's ignoring me"". 


When in reality, you're just so busy with your life, it is inherently amusing to see that. Juxtapose this to how many TRPers think: ""hurr, i should use amused mastery.",24,1
Simple Chicken Recipe,"**TL;DR**

Chicken good. Chicken help gains. Not much time in week. Simple recipe save time!

Grab a pack of chicken breasts, throw them in a baking tray. Sprinkle over seasoning of your choice. No oil needed. Throw in oven (Gas Mark 5 | 190C | 375F) for 40 minutes. Take cooked chicken and put in containers, store in fridge. Throughout the week use chicken in wraps / meals. Enjoy.

**Body:**

These days almost every post I see is dedicated to the eternal struggle with women, relationship drama's or profound existential conundrums. Today i am going to mix things up a bit with a simple post about a chicken.

Like many of you reprobates, i am a busy man. Balancing a job, workouts, hobbies, interests, family, looking at myself in the mirror and being a social hyena is all very challenging in this day and age. So any ways i find for cutting down on wasted time are a true blessing. Here is one such tip that has served me greatly when prepping meals for the week.

This is a very simple recipe for perfectly cooked chicken, almost no wasted calories and requires minimal prep/cleanup. You can throw the cooked chicken into containers and keep it in the fridge throughout the week. Then you can easily throw it into meals, snacks, wraps etc. Bonus tip is to cut the chicken into pre-weighed amounts (i stick with 100g chunks), to make calorie counting even quicker.

**The seasoning**

The brilliance of this recipe is that you can make up whatever seasoning combinations you can find in your cupboard on the day. Always fun to experiment. My usual go-to is paprika, salt, pepper &amp; rosemary.

You don't need any oil for this, it really doesn't need it.

**The Recipe**

1. Get yourself a pack of chicken breasts, any will do.
2. Optional step: Throw chicken onto chopping board and cut off the messy bits.
3. Throw chicken into baking tray.
4. Sprinkle over seasoning of your choice.
5. Throw in oven (Gas Mark 5 | 190C | 375F) for 40 minutes.
6. Take out of oven.
7. Admire biceps.
8. Throw into containers.
9. Throw containers into fridge,

Enjoy. Now get back to the gym.",54,1
Some Thoughts About Our Future - Or Lack of One,"Obviously there's a lot of crazy shit going on currently and I've been thinking about it and had a couple of thoughts I thought I share with you about where we are headed. Part of this comes from watching Redonkulous/Terrence Popp's latest video.

It's been apparent for a few years now that there is one accepted view of the world (leftist), the media pushes it, the politicians push it, everything pushes it, from social media sites to woke corporations with their woke adverts, etc.

Anything disagreeing with it is immediately termed racist or fascist or toxic or etc and is shut down, either people are removed from social media, youtube,etc, and Facebook even ban anything mentioning certain names like Tommy Robinson for example.

Even TheRedPill is a classed as a ""dangerous"" idea that needs to be silenced, it really is getting like 1984 where for example even facts are re-spun into obvious lies and we're supposed to believe it. E.g. that car hitting those 2 women who had blocked off the road in the US.

2 white protesters hit by a black driver, and they're trying to spin it that the driver is a white supremacist attacking BLM (so black people really). It's nuts.

Anyway, I started paying attention to all of this some years ago after watching a YouTube video filmed in 1984 of Yuri Bezmenov, a former KGB officer talking about how the Communists would subvert a nation from within, how they did it, and how you could see it happening even then (I highly recommend you go watch it if you haven't seen it).

Well everything he said would happen in that video is happening or has happened, the Police are the bad guys who deserve to be attacked, the criminals are the peaceful protestors, etc, etc, etc. The older you are, the more you will recognise.

One of the main points he made was that it takes I think 15 to 20 years to subvert a country, because that's how long it takes to indoctrinate 1 generation through school, etc.

I think we're actually into the 2nd or maybe even 3rd generation of indoctrination, and it's the indoctrination of splitting people into groups and making them believe that they are victims (minority vs majority, women vs men, black vs white, Islam vs Christianity, gay vs straight, etc).

It could be racism, or homophobia, or misogynists, toxic men, the patriarchy, transphobia (that didn't even exist until recently - it effects hardly anyone but has been turned into a huge talking point by the media), islamophobia, LGBTXYZ bias, you name it there's someone victimising them.

Then you have the wage gap, rape allegations, metoo, etc, etc, etc...

And in practically every case for every group the main blame is being laid at the doors of... MEN.

All of these chickens are now coming home to roost, and the only people who could realistically stand up to violent struggle/oppression - i.e. men - are as far as everyone else is concerned the bad guy and the problem.

So the minute you resist they wreak violence on you, get you fired from your job, shut you down because you're obviously a nazi bigot - it is impossible to win.

On top of that with every alternative voice being drowned out by the media, social media, youtube, reddit, etc, the left have a massive platform from which to communicate and organise, and we have - nothing.

In that scenario we'd be in trouble.

I'm pretty certain this is what's going on, it's right out of the Commie playbook and even the Nazis used the same tactics to come to power - the brown shirts created havoc on the streets, and once Hitler had power they pulled out the long knives and executed all of the useful idiots, because they didn't need them any more and wanted stability.

But by then they are in charge and they rule with an iron fist.

I don't know who is behind it, Soros gets mentioned a lot, China as well, but who knows, but it looks to me like there's an effort to destroy the West and bring in a new order with new rulers, and men - we're going to be the fall guys.

This BLM/Antifa crap that's going on is I am sure going to escalate and we're going to be in a bad way very quickly, it's basically heading for civil war all over the West not just the US.

The covid lockdown has really helped it - people can go out on the streets instead of having to go to work, which has kept the whole thing rolling.

All you can see, hear and feel is division and anger and it's being stoked from all sides by the media, politicians and corporations.

Anyway I know that's not very coherently stictched together, but I think we're in some really troubling times and we need to step back and think about what's happening.

AWALT! A classic example from recent times!," 

A few days back I posted on MGTOW2 about one of my slovakian friends of 6 years who suddenly wants to marry me. Here is the post - 

 ""**A girl I am friends with for the past 6 years wants to marry me.** \-&gt;

 I am an Indian, 26 yr old, full stack web dev. She is a slovak studying medicine. I flirt with a lot of girls from all over the world. My current interests are two latinas, one from colombia and another from mexico. Honestly, I prefer latinas but marriage is out of the cards since I am bipolar and divorce rate is 90% for bipolar people and on top of that I don't want mentally ill kids. Now this slovak girl had a serious boyfriend for a couple of years and only few months back she started to reveal that I make her happy and I am the source of her happiness. That seemed weird to me because I am the only person who makes me happy and she got a bit hurt by the response. Only a couple of days back she revealed that she was single and I didn't even want to know. She texts me all day. And honestly I flirt with a lot of girls and post on my facebook and insta story the convos. She sees all of them. I asked her like 30 minutes back that I am confused with so many girls and don't know what to do. She asked me to just enjoy life. I asked her if she is jealous or not, she said no and it seems so weird to me. Like genuinely she wants us to get married despite knowing I am bipolar and what not. Guys, I am not stupid, I know this is a trap. But I can't understand wtf is going on right now. Like I need a red pill analysis. I am so confused as to why all these women know that I flirt and sext with other people and yet they don't have any problems. I think I am the one who is getting played here. Need a red pill analysis from you folks. ""

Now I am a very redpilled guy and you can learn a bit of my redpill journey from my stickied post on my profile to get an idea about who I am..

Point is I always knew that something was up and there is no reason why suddenly a slovakian girl would want to marry me when I am not even attracted to her. Turns out the redpilled guys in the comment section was right. She confessed to me today that she makes out with ""male friends"" and ""gay guys"" behind her boyfriends back.  
Go have a look -

But the thing is, women are most of the times 100% honest with me from the first conversation or eventually, because they realize I am not stupid and not somebody to fuck around with. I don't tolerate bullshit much.  
But this is a prime proof, that no matter how nice or pretty or decent she tries to behave, she is not an exception. There are no exceptions. Slutiness is ingrained in their nature. They can't deny that.  
I am regurgitating the same info that I learned on day one from this sub back in 2016 and that is ALL WAMEN ARE LIKE THAT. AWALT! Take the red pill and keep spinning plates. I would definitely plate her and shelve her for now. But young guys don't get disillusioned. There is nothing called love. There is only psychological manipulation. It's all a game. Either you are playing or you are getting played. Either you have the frame and game, or you have nothing.

What does Schopenhauer mean by this remark on women discriminating each other?,"Reading Schopenhauer's essay on women, he makes the following remark. 

"" with women, differences of rank are much more precarious than with us; because, while a hundred considerations carry weight in our case, in theirs there is only one, namely, with which man they have found favor; as also that they stand in much nearer relations with one another than men do, in consequence of the one-sided nature of their calling. This makes them endeavor to lay stress upon differences of rank. ""

Earlier he says that a fine lady would often behave disdainfully towards a woman of lower social position. She speaks to her as if she was a lower creature. 

This reminds me a little bit of *Mean Girls* and the main character in particular, who would often criticize other girls by how they look, how poor they are, how unfashionable they are, and the defects of their sex lives. 

Furthermore, an ex girlfriend is always outraged whenever her ex boyfriend is seeing a woman who is more humble than her. At least in my perspective. 

Can somebody elaborate on what Schopenhauer meant by his comment? Particularly when he says ""while a hundred considerations carry weight in our case, in theirs there is only one, namely, with which man they have found favor""",15,1

"""Now, what are you going to do with your life""","**TL;DR:** Mind your own business. Society is not your enemy, neither is it your friend.

I was getting home after a walk, being recently graduated I was thinking of the next steps I should take in life. At the house, family was over.

One of them asked me ""Now, what are you going with your life?""

I replied ""Have fun.""

They responded, ""You can only do that so long. You have to work.""

Another, ""Yeah, like get a job.""

I then responded ""Well, yeah, have fun and make money. Either way i'll figure it out""

I disagreed with their perspective; they viewed work as something negative. I left them and went to build some shit in solitude.

Many people have boring and/or horribly sad lives. They may act and believe as if it's not. However judge a book by it's cover and read the summary on the back. We all believe they are the main character in a movie. Truth is we're not, they are roadkill. The roadkill you occasionally see when you're driving; Or the animals foolishly on the road wanting to see what civilization is all about. To then be responded by getting smashed with a car.

Many waste their lives working for money. Do not work for money, work for yourself and mind your own business. These people can be bought. Be the man who dose not have a price.

The Majority are slaves to resource; Women, money, food, water, etc...

In the book; The Road by Cormac McCarthy, there is a father and his son. They live in a post-apocalyptic world filled with cannibalism. The father brings his boy up to have a code in a place where there is no morals. The first thing he teaches his son is how to commit suicide. It's one of the most depressing books I've read. However, also the most hopeful.

We all die, but how do we live?

Do we live to not die? Is it better to die with pride or to survive?

In the book, the father tells his son that they are ""carrying the fire"". They carry the last remains of good aspects humanity.

You can not change others, they can only change themselves. Allow others to fail, it is their right. Mind your own business and work for yourself. Learn better ways to to be better.

Questions to ask yourself when placing a woman in your life.,"tldr; When considering keeping a woman in your life, keeping her as a plate, or promoting her further, ask the following three questions:

1. Am I gaining anything at all from this relationship? 
2. Am I getting what I want from this relationship? 
3. Am I getting enough of what I want from this relationship? 

#Introduction: 

Far too many of you are entertaining women that‚Äôre giving you nothing or giving women who haven't earned it too much attention. This is obviously a problem; why are you wasting your precious time talking to women that are just using you for validation without giving you anything in return and promoting women who haven't earned a promotive spot in your life?

Whenever I find myself wondering whether or not I should keep a woman in my life at all, keep her as a plate, or promote her, I ask myself the following three questions in numeric order and act accordingly. 

##1. Am I gaining anything *at all* from this relationship? 

If you‚Äôre not gaining anything from a relationship with a woman, or anybody from that matter, you‚Äôre wasting your time and being used. Just because you‚Äôre not fucking a woman doesn‚Äôt mean you have to get rid of her. I have women that‚Äôll do my work for me if I ask them nicely enough, women who can serve as social proof when I go out, and women who will give me a place to stay if I need it. These are women I rarely talk to and only talk to if I want something.

If I‚Äôm gaining absolutely *nothing* from a relationship I burn the bridge. I don‚Äôt have time to waste and neither do you. If you‚Äôre gaining something from the relationship but not sexually attracted to the woman, you can stop here. 

If you're gaining something and you *are* sexually attracted to the woman, ask the next question.

##2. Am I getting what I want from the relationship? 

If you‚Äôre gaining something *and* it‚Äôs what you want, assuming you're attracted to her sexually, congratulations. You‚Äôre probably fucking her and she‚Äôs a plate. Don‚Äôt fuck this up by getting too clingy and having a weak frame. Hold frame and keep the sidebar principles in mind.  

If you're not getting what you want, return to the previous question and revaluate the situation accordingly.

If you‚Äôre getting what you want, your frame is solid and the attraction is rising, you can train her to give you what you want more often. Knowing if the attraction is growing is a matter of complacency and experience; if she‚Äôs complying with what you want to do and she seems to want more of it, then you know she‚Äôs into you enough to be trained properly. Which leads me into the next question‚Ä¶ 

##3. Am I getting *enough* of what I want from this relationship? 

This question is for people considering an LTR or just keeping a woman around for a long period of time. If you‚Äôre considering an LTR and your vetting skills are razor-sharp, your frame is strong as fuck, and you truly believe you‚Äôre her best option, then good luck and godspeed. Just because she seems to be giving you what you want in the quantities that you want doesn't mean you can slack; it just means she's earned more of your attention. Enjoy your turn while it lasts.

#Conclusion: 
A majority of your problems with women stem from giving them too much attention when they haven't earned it. When considering giving a woman a little more attention in order to train them or promote them, keep these questions contained in this post in mind and promote or demote accordingly. 

#Takeaway: 
Always consider the women in your life and make sure you have a proper plan for placing them in your life. Don‚Äôt promote women who aren‚Äôt worth it, and discard women who are simply using you and you‚Äôre getting nothing in return.

Daily Reminder: Smoke The Competition,"*‚ÄùAll men are trash!‚Äù*

Seem familiar? You probably don‚Äôt even need a twitter to have heard this feminist phrase before.  Often expressed by disgruntled girls who, perhaps you should know, aren‚Äôt getting their plumbing rearranged. (We‚Äôll touch on that in a bit too) There is, however, a grain of truth to this.

To start, **this phrase, along with feminism itself, is just a massive shit test.** Don‚Äôt be trash, know within yourself that you aren‚Äôt trash, and, with a little awareness of the feminine problem, you‚Äôll be stuck between finding this laughable and having a grain of pity. Because *you should know by now you aren‚Äôt trash,* but the truth is, *most* men *are.* Take note of that 1% - 10% of men are getting all the pussy statistic that gets tossed around in the sidebar. 

Most guys are simply lost. Most guys are out of shape, lacking any game, dressing like shit, orbiting some bitch, white knighting on twitter all while stroking their neck beards in one hand and dick in the other, or getting rejected by a billion girls because they just send dick pics and expect quality pussy to land in their lap. (The latter sometimes wins some lays, but as stated it‚Äôs usually low tier Alaskan trout rivers. Again we‚Äôll touch on that.) 

... (unlike those trout rivers; please don‚Äôt touch that.)

Most guys aren‚Äôt red. Most men aren‚Äôt *you* - you are, or should be, above the low standard rest. Dress nice, cultivate half of a personality, maybe spiced with some dark triad traits, and don‚Äôt drink/eat garbage so much that you get a dad bod ass looking beer belly. This isn‚Äôt hard, yet it already sets you miles ahead of the competition. Most guys have fallen so far off the path that, even being average, you stand out like a high smv male for just being healthy, in shape, and at least being able to pretend you still have some sanity. As a matter of fact, you don‚Äôt necessarily need a mission to do this - you can be living at your mom‚Äôs house and still slay by being Captain Mysterious and fucking a girl in in the woods, the car, or at her place, hiding details of your life - you have a mission because you need something more purposeful to fulfill your life with since, once you start having an abundance of pussy, you realize how much of a purposeless pursuit women are since **women are trash too.** 

Wait, what? Seriously?

Indeed. 

Let me cut to the chase here. *Most people are shit.* I know, I know, certainly a cynical statement, but it is the truth. AWALT? Sure. But AMALT? Perhaps *APALT* is more fitting.

For every neckbeard on twitter, there is a fat harpy who can‚Äôt keep cake or dick out of her mouth. For every orbiter, there is a slut. For every poor, ghetto impoverished fuckboy, there is a bitchy e-thot with tattoos, colored hair and piercings all over her body. For every disgruntled incel on 4chinz, there is a disgruntled SJW on Twitter. All in the yin and the yang I suppose.

I really don‚Äôt have to repeat much rhetoric for you to know that girls fail just as much to stay in shape, have any sentiment of charming girl game, or acquire any decent commitment to leech off a quality man to build herself. (The latter being the female equivalent of self improvement, I suppose.) Most of these bitches are just as ugly as fuck, and half the time can be just as annoying and charmless; even if you are swooning and fucking her on the regular, she is probably a better shit tester than the she is a charmer. I‚Äôve seen it; I‚Äôm quick to toss a girl out because of it too since I go softer than MyPillow‚Ñ¢ once this dark, garbage personality comes out. Any hole is not a goal, but that‚Äôs just my taste, brother. Perhaps I like the finer holes in life.

Women are completely incapable of realizing this, but they can be unattractive too. What a wasteful tragedy. The end result of this is Clown World; a shit circus of unhappy sluts who give in to the need of dick and will even fuck losers, now whom, having their loser mentality validated by their n count of 1, will continue on with being a bunch of losers thinking it will work again. Hell, some of these guys are virgins but will slut their attention out in exchange for the female attention they are so starved of. Cue the invention of social media. 

So where does that leave you, my fellow heros and outlaws? Smoke the competition; being average sets you above the bar already. Take care of your health, learn to laugh at this cosmic shit circus, and focus on your craft, and you are well on your way to that 1% life. Fuck any trash girl you please, and, perhaps if it‚Äôs something you desire, maybe even find a charming, cute girl to actually have a tolerable LTR with. There still are some attractive guys out there who are still getting attractive gals. I see you cutiepies out there, no homo. (Well, maybe a little.) 

Don‚Äôt lose hope; work hard, join the club, and *rise above.*",44,1
"Fulfillment is the goal of every man that walks this earth, and today you get to decide how and if you will take on this process","Women are an accessory to your existence. This has been known by men and women alike since the beginning of time. Technology and the industrial revolution has played a major role in giving every human on this planet a voice, but 5,900 years of history cannot come unglued in 100 years. I see smoking mirrors and your inability to ignore this, only provides fuel to the fire and a spark of insecurity within yourself.


The insecurities of women and people as a whole has become more evident due to the technological changes are world has experienced. But a lot of noise does not change history, and it does not change facts. Men have and always will have dominion over women and the rest of the earth. It is in our genetics, it is in our purpose, and it is in our hearts.


You see... life is much more than women, it‚Äôs about fulfillment. It‚Äôs about looking at yourself and feeling a sense of pride.


However, in order to get there, you will need to make your way through several obstacles. In the end, fulfillment will look different for everyone, but it is (or should be) the end goal of all men that walk this earth.


Those who do not recognize this to be the case, are weak, intellectually incapable, or immature. And, for any young men out there, you maturity comes through experience. You must be patient and understanding. 


Because it isn‚Äôt until you‚Äôve gone through these experiences that you can recognize the true beauty of growth. It isn‚Äôt until you‚Äôve grown through these experiences that you can truly accept a sense of purpose as deep as fulfillment is. But, with patience and will, you can eventually find your higher self, and as a result a deeper purpose for your life.


Women, money, social success, make up such a small piece of life‚Äôs fulfillment, but for some it isn‚Äôt until you‚Äôve experienced these things that you come to realize this. For the other, more intellectual around us, you are already on your way. 


All the tangible objects around you are merely an illusion of a life of success. True success is pride and a deep sense of self. True success comes in the form of living life, and experiencing things with a sense of deep gratitude or appreciation. True success is self love and confidence. 


For all those who have yet to feel this, you need to immerse yourself intellectually and physically in the world around you. You need to dig your fingers in the dirt and you need to push yourself beyond your perceived abilities or limits.


Most importantly, you need to experience insecurity, for it is the tool that will make you grow and mature the most. And, it isn‚Äôt until you have matured that you will be able to look at life with a true meaning and purpose.",10,1

What should be the right attitudes toward those blue pilled men?,"I have no doubt in the truthfulness of the red pill. However, I believe you guys must have been attacked by blue pilled men out of nowhere when you have expressed some opinions of the red pill.

I can understand that women attack the red pill like crazy, I normally ignore them. What upset me are those white knights. Not only do they not agree with you, they ridicule you, deride you and even humiliate you. Even other men somewhat agree with you, they don't express anything, they don't help us to fight back. We are helping them and revealing the truth for them. But, what I see is apathy, if not antipathy. If they are so happy being in blue pill, why should we help them. I am starting to think, that many men are truly weak by nature, they want to be manipulated by women. They deserve to be zeroed out by women, suffer from their emotional abuse, and  they deserve to masturbate in their bedrooms and get no women. That's what they should get. Women are definitely treating them right. They love women so much that they want to be tortured by women, like in BDSM.

If so, why should we feel unfair about women's manipulation to men? Many men love it. They enjoy it. They enjoy deficiency in sex; hey enjoy giving everything to women; they want to be lied to; they want to be humiliated and abused by women. Women are just doing their jobs and fulfilling those men's desire.

I once thought, men should get together and fight back those manipulations of women. Now I have doubt whether it's right and not to mention whether it's worth it. If most men don't care about their rights and want to be afflicted, why should I care?",45,1
How much do you really need to achieve?,"This is going to be a bit controversial here and I'd like to start of by saying I'm trying to start a discussion here, I'm not writing this to publish it as absolute truth.

I was watching Roosh's video, ""Is self-improvement necessary"" and he goes on about how all these self-improvement and motivational gurus, society or even the people here advocate this never endless cycle of getting more. He says self-improvement isn't really necessary, which I disagree with, but there are other thoughts he states that I do agree with, which is, if you're already satisfied and happy at your state, why force yourself to seek more?

A lot of people google how do I get the ""motivation"" to make more money, get more girls and etc. But I've been thinking, what if I'm already happy with the quality of girls I get? What if I'm already happy with the fact that I can pay my rent, sleep on a comfortable bed and I get to turn on the A/C if it gets too hot/cold.

They will tell you, ""hey if you do more of ***x***, you could get more of ***y***"" but I'm already happy with the amount of ***y*** I'm getting, If I need to get more of ***y*** then I will work and do more of ***x***, but if I don't, why should I work more?

If you're one of those people who just have a strong desire for more materialistic things, more women, more status and that's really what you want, then go ahead *(I do encourage you to do some soul searching, because this is unhealthy, that's up to you),* but if you're not one of those people, like me, you don't need to force yourself to do so. 

What I think people should focus on is to achieve enough money and self-improve enough to the point where you're comfortable enough, you have enough money to pay your rent and put food on your table, and you also have enough money to go do things you enjoy. If the thing you enjoy doing requires a lot more money, then work, but if not, then don't.

The point I'm trying to make is, this self-improvement journey, is never ending, you will never be satisfied if you're trying to fix every tiny bit of flaw you have. I think you need to reach a point where you're satisfied, and once you do, it's not necessary to make more.

Like an example is, game and such, once you get the premise of how to get laid or get into a relationship, why ""self-improve"" beyond that? If you do something that turns the girl off and it seemingly harmless to her or yourself, you don't need to fix that. Just find another girl who is fine with that.

As you grow older, the mistakes you do with money and women will be less since you will ***naturally*** learn without effort. You don't have to manually fix it. The same way a baby learns language naturally, the baby doesn't deliberately go out of his way to learn a language, it's just day by day, they ***grow***.

I hope my post at least made you start thinking about this, again, I'm not trying to state this as absolute truth, but my goal here to day is to make people start critically thinking in regards to all this self-improvement topic.",37,1

New to TRP- Early Success,"Past 50 divorced over 1 year, new to TRP

Was Alpha 20 years ago 19 year marriage, was trying to be good husband and dad, softened over time to be team player- became what my wife wanted- then of course it wasnt what she wanted.

Newly single tried being nice guy- what I was made into, very mixed results. Started back lifting about a year ago. Bench up to 270- I weigh 180 Then recently just tried caring less, getting more confident, into scarcity mode.

Went out this week and just was total confident, didnt care mode, if it doesnt work out who cares. Went in early with the touching, fist bumps, hug, deep looks. Told her I liked her body and then went straight into deal breakers- must be good kisser and affectionate, what Im into sex wise.

Went to my car- to drive to a different place together, went in for the kiss and makeout session. Had to cut it short, I had stuff to do next day.

She sends me this text today

my name- I have to tell you you are very accomplished and polished and raw at the same time. Intriguing sexy as fuck man. I like that you have kinda thrown me off my game, its exciting and feel it challenge me. I have a strong and quick mind- personaliity and its not often I meet a man as strong and having a quicker mind than me. I liked the way your hands field on my body and your tongue in my mouth. Enjoy your day.

Forget the nice guy routine, women want someone strong and direct, the alpha. Doesnt mean Im not polite or respectful, but no more texting for anything but logistics, no long phone calls etc",9,1
How the Redpill saved me from a toxic SJW.,"About three years ago, I met a girl on Tinder. We were both new to the area, and both happened to have moved there recently from Seattle. We closed down a bar on our first date, and she proceeded to take me back to her place and fuck my brains out.

At this point in my life I was just beginning to wake up to TRP truths. My previous relationship had been with a woman who was beautiful on the outside, miserable on the inside. Yet I had clung to her like a total chump, trying everything I could to save the relationship even though I didn't really want to. She was cold, and the bedroom was colder. That experience led to my first exposure to the Redpill, but I was still resistant to the ideas and clung to my plugged-in fantasy of what relationships were supposed to be like. At the time, I read No More Mr. Nice Guy, but still rejected core TRP as ""extreme"".

Okay, back to the new chick. She is tall, black hair, half native-american, absolutely beautiful. However she's also covered in tattoos and has a bit of a grungy-hippie aesthetic. She went to art school and identifies as a bisexual and hardcore feminist. At the time, though, I didn't see any of these as red flags, I saw them as ""my type.""  

Also, I was distracted by the fact that she was busy draining my balls on a daily basis. She was constantly horny, constantly initiating sex with a blowjob. If we weren't fucking, we were partying or hanging out. I thought she was everything my previous girlfriend wasnt. Vibrant, fun, funny, and highly sexual. Basically I was blinded by pussy.

But then unignorable red flags began to pop up left and right.

She drank every night, a minimum of a six pack. I have no idea how she managed to stay so slender.

She was also a chainsmoker and vaper. The point of the vape was to avoid cigarettes, but cigarettes always magically appeared after a few beers.

She had major daddy issues. Her dad beat her up as a kid, and possibly sexually assaulted her, meanwhile leaving her sister completely alone and spoiling her. But she also still loved her dad and yearned for his approval.

Meanwhile she had a codependent relationship with her mom. They lived together. Her mom and dad separated but stayed married, which ruined her mom psychologically. She was very childlike, and incapable of caring for herself. She got $4,000 every month from her not-husband, but she frequently couldn't make rent because she blew all her money on expensive junk and other bullshit. My chick was not great with money herself, ended up having to cover her moms rent all the time. They had frequent drama with each other. In a lot of ways, my girlfriend was like a single mother because she came with this weirdly dependant and childish mother.

After a month or so of dating, she told me she loved me, that I was the only. person she had ever felt that for and that she could see herself marrying.

After that this girl started having toxic meltdowns while drunk. She would go apeshit, crying, talking shit, saying anything she could to get a rise out of me. She'd keep me up all hours of the night, getting increasingly drunk and psychotic. I should have bailed out the first time that happened but again, I was blinded by pussy.

It was like she wanted to test me, to try and push me to abandon her or hit her. She did not understand intimacy and love without chaos and abuse.

Between these drunken meltdowns, she would revert to bombing me with affection and pussy. It was as if the shitty nights did not happen for her. When I told her they had to stop, that the way she was acting was totally unnecessary and damaging, she became incredibly defensive and would try everything she could to guilt trip me or make me be the one in the wrong. 

Frustrated by the rollercoaster of emotional chaos and wild, uninhibited pussy, I finally turned to the red pill for guidance. Through that, I found Rollo Tomassi and Rich Cooper. I read the books, watched the videos, all that good shit. I realized that I had been much more naturally redpilled as a teen and had slowly allowed myself to be beta-ized in the pursuit of appealing to SJW pussy. 

I began to connect the dots between her feminist, SJW persona and her daddy issues and toxic, emotionally abusive behavior. Pretty soon, it was very clear that this woman would destroy my life If I let her.

So without further ado, I decided to trust the wisdom I learned from TRP sources and cut this chick out of my life. Her reaction was to have a complete and total meltdown. That first night she called me dozens of times, left like 8 voicemails, and sent dozens of texts, all of which oscillated back and forth between begging for me to come back and crazy vitriol about what an entitled white guy I was. So I blocked her. Naturally, she started blowing up my email after that and tried to contact me through her friends' and mom's phones. She even showed up drunk at my place once, banging on the door and begging to be let in. Of course, she was wasted.

A couple months later, I ran into her at a concert. I was drunk, and against my better judgement I went home with her. Of course she fucked my brains out and told me all this wonderful stuff about how she only saw herself with me and having a family with me. I barely said a word as I was just drunk and wanted to get my rocks off.

As we lay there in her bed she told me she was dating a sweet guy but didnt love him. She said that she didnt know what love was before me, and that no one else understood her body or could make her cum like I could. In the same conversation she told me she had been using Seeking Arrangements on the side to make rent money by giving old dudes blow jobs. In the same breath she told me she wanted to marry me, have my babies, and yet was cheating on someome and whoring herself out at the same time - all without a hint of shame or self awareness. She even told me she felt powerful giving old dude blowjobs, and that it was like a ""fuck you"" to her dad. She then proceeded to start sucking my cock again.

I saw so many redpill truths spilling out of her mouth, it was like clear confirmation of TRP handed to me wrapped up in a bow. Why had I ever even entertained the idea of letting this person have any part in my life? 

When I woke up, completely sober, I slipped out of her apartment without a word. I checked my phone blocker later and saw she had tried calling twelve times. Im sure she views me as the asshole who abandoned her, and has given no consideration to her own behavior. 

TRP saved my life from a Trainwreck. I almost thought this absolute dumpster fire of a human was my soul mate just because she was always down to fuck and said all kinds of sweet shit in my ear when she wasnt acting like a psychopath.

The only problem is that now that Im unplugged, relationships just feel fake. They can still be a lot of fun, but I feel no emotional attachment. Maybe that will change over time, but now all the dynamics women use in relationships just feel so blatant and tiresome. 

But hell, I'll take this any day over letting my life be ruined by a toxic alcoholic feminist with daddy issues.",122,1

Women Are Like Snakes...,"I hope you read past the title because this post isn't what you think it is.

Sun Tzu says:

***Not all those who cause us harm are our enemies, so we need to know the ambitions of our friends as well as our perceived enemies.***

and

***If we know the designs of our enemies, then we may have a chance to turn them into allies, even if for just a short time.***

Its a little startling just how many here view women as the enemy.  Yet so many need them to feed their ego and use as a measuring stick to judge success.  These people don't hate women. They hate that they need women.

Women are like snakes.  And I don't mean they are sneaky and cold.  I mean that we don't try to understand them.  We perceive them as enemies.  Do you think a snake looks at you as its enemy?  A snake wants to eat, fuck and get through life expending as little calories as possible.

Some snakes on my farm I have to kill because they are hazards.  But most I know are eating rats and other snakes.  The emotional reaction is to hate them.  But they are an ally nonetheless.

Every time I mention that I have a girlfriend here I can feel the disdain in the replies.  Why, because I get laid at will and don't have to chase it?  Because she fucks other girls with me?  Because she will tell me everything I want to know about women and how to get them because its a way she pleases and serves me?

A women is like a snake.  If you aren't constantly conscious that you are holding something that can bite you, then you are an idiot.  But if you know the nature of the snake and what it wants and what its good at, then you can use it to your advantage. ",50,1
The Meek Shall inherit the earth,"I've noticed lots of you niggas  shitting not this phrase. I'm here to correct a misunderstanding that's been going on in this community about it. When we all hear of the word meek, we think of someone weak. Heck, the definition of Meek on google or anywhere for that matter means :

 (meek/mƒìk/

1. quiet, gentle, and easily imposed on; submissive.

Well,  in this [source](https://www.biblewise.com/bible_study/questions/definition-meekness.php) the op gives an example of who the Bible refers to as being the most Meek in the of Numbers 12:3 ; take a guess. Moses! Now I haven't read the Bible in years but I reckon just like me you  still recall the story of Moses, and he was anything but meek if we go by the definition google provides.  Meek was mistranslated or changed meaning, the part of the bible it came from was originally in greek and its meaning leans toward those who who have swords and know how to use them but keeps it sheath equaling a tame but dangerous individual when needs to be. One quote I think of when I hear meek  is of the following by Jordan B Peterson ( wishing him a speedy recovery ) :

If you're harmless, you're not virtuous you're just harmless. If you on the other hand have the capacity to be a monster, but you choose not to be - then you're virtuous.

Now after this explanation and the source text provided above, wouldn't you agree with the Bible that;

# 1. False advertising

*Don't try to be something you are not, eventually she will notice and feel betrayed*

I had my fair share of tinder dates, some of them looked really good in the pictures but when met face to face they were downright fat. I felt as I was lied to because that was obvious false advertising; in some instances I was even pissed. I made my mind right then and there. I looked on the positive side of things and I enjoyed meeting a new person with no plan on ever seeing them again. You learn a lot just by talking to random people instead of keeping to your bubble so there is no reason to act like a little bitch and go home.

So why act more alpha than you are? You don't get flip a switch from Beta Billy to Alpha Chad. It's a gradual change that happens in time by experiencing life. If you advertise yourself as a super Alpha dominant male only to say 'I love you' after you cum, that is false advertising. She will smell that Betaness through any layer of packaging you try to put yourself in. The later, the worse, as she will feel like she lost too much time on you. Then the inevitable happens, she will cheat, find someone else while also being with you. And you will be coming back to TRP crying about how all women are whores.

If you hooked up with a girl that got super fat in the first couple of months wouldn't you be pissed? The same applies for women, though they have different standards.

# 2. The higher you try to fly, the harder the fall

I remember that post about the MMA guy who got dumped by his MMA GF because 'he lost a fight'. People were saying it's because he showed weakness but they saw weakness as losing the match. I think weakness came from he fact that he advertised himself as a tough guy, lying his way till he got proven to be a bitch. She even says it, the worst thing was seeing him defending punches by flailing his arms. She did not dump him because he lost the fight, he could've lost it like a man. She dumped him because she felt that she was lied to. You can see it in her anger when she talks about it. Had the guy been true to himself, we could've had a MMA GF while also not going in the octagon to prove her he's a real man. Of course, this is pure speculation as we do not know nothing about their relationship except for this small speck of information but I would bet good money he was the kind of guy constantly trying to prove others he's macho and the fight sealed the deal. Had he not lived in a lie, he could've kept the girl.

A Crucial Life Lesson From A Billionaire's Superyacht,"Very few people on this planet have had the experience of sailing around on a billionaire's superyacht.

I am one of those few people.

Now, for obvious reasons I can't disclose who the billionaire was or who I am.

But at the time, I was:

* in my late-twenties
* working between 80-100 hours each week (and loving every second of it)
* one of the top performers in a company that said billionaire owned a majority stake in
* making upwards of $5 million a year through bonuses and commissions

I was naively excited to be chosen and invited on board as the billionaire's right-hand man. My purpose was to entertain and delight some big investors.

Sounded simple enough, but there were so many intricacies.

By the end of the trip, I felt like I had been avoiding stepping on landmines the entire time.

Here's the main reason why:

Billionaire's have MASSIVE egos and are CONSTANTLY seeking your approval and attention

Prior to being invited on board, I had only spent time with this billionaire in his office or at restaurants, usually when we had an entire room or a booth to ourselves.

The owners of these establishments knew who he was and treated him with respect and fear. Sometimes strangers would point fingers and say ""Oh my God, is that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?"" and he would ignore them or pretend he couldn't hear them.

I was expecting that same kind of demeanor on his superyacht, but boy was I wrong.

As soon as we stepped on board, his crew greeted us with a warm smile.

That was as far as we got before the bragging started... **and didn't stop.**

For a solid hour, the billionaire gave us a 'tour' of the place - and by tour, I mean detailing every single room and told us a story or interesting fact about each room.

It felt overwhelming. I looked around and nobody else shared that same feeling of exhaustion or boredom. It's like they were drawn in and dazed.

That's not to say that it wasn't impressive. Having a dozen bedrooms, a pool, a helicopter pad and a cinema room on board was definitely something exceptional. But he didn't treat it like a toy - it was his pride and joy.

It was a part of who he was, and to not show appreciation toward the boat was an insult to him.

**Everybody laughed when he told a joke, even if it wasn't funny.**

**Everybody said 'wow' in unison when he asked them ""isn't that something?""**

I was told I would be the 'right-hand man' but I ended up like the rest, following him around like a lapdog.

Finally, after some entr√©es, a few glasses of champagne and some of the beautiful girls we met earlier came out, things were getting a bit rowdy.

I was finally having a good time, mingling with some men who had played their cards extremely well.

They weren't particularly the smartest people I had met.

**But they were clever and, most importantly, ruthless.**

After our main course, the co-captain told us we were in a great fishing spot and that a dozen rods had been prepared and baited. He gives the billionaire a pat on the back.

We all line up and our sinkers plunge into the water.

After five minutes of near silence, the billionaire's rod starts bending.

He's got a bite and he reels in a massive fish - it's half the size of him, and he's met with a round of applause.

A few more minutes pass, and he pulls up another one. Another round of applause.

He makes a joke about being very lucky today. As he's speaking, he reels in another one - yet another round of applause.

**Nobody else caught a fish.**

At this point, I wouldn't have been surprised if there was a scuba diver hooking these fish up for him.

Or maybe we were all using awful bait and he had the good stuff?

I was over it at this point.

Nothing too eventful happened afterwards, but the lesson stuck with me:

*No matter how rich, powerful or successful you may be, some people never conquer the need to feel important and appreciated.*

This might seem like a basic Dale Carnegie lesson, but the fact that this billionaire simply **had** to be the center of attention the entire trip was mind-boggling.",1,1

Getting Laid for Ego Validation is Perfectly Okay,"This comes from a coaching call with one of my clients recently. We were discussing all the pros and cons of getting laid, and he was man enough to admit one of the biggest reasons he wanted to get laid a lot was for the ego boost and validation. He phrased it as:

*‚ÄúTo be honest, a big part of wanting to get laid a lot is about being viewed as ‚Äúelite‚Äù by other people.‚Äù*

The *normies* will tell you doing anything for ego or validation is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù or ‚Äúshallow‚Äù or ‚Äúbeta as fuck, bro ‚Äì an Alpha doesn‚Äôt care what others think!‚Äù

Fuck that nonsense.

**Ego validation is a fucking** ***brilliant*** **reason for pushing yourself and turning yourself into a better man.**

If most guys are honest, ego validation is the *main* reason they want to get laid. That‚Äôs a *good* thing ‚Äì at the start you need all the motivation you can possibly get, especially when you‚Äôre full of doubt as to whether you‚Äôll actually succeed. If you‚Äôre doing it for ego and validation, **GOOD**. Use that as fuel to push yourself harder ‚Äì chase that ego validation.

Yes, *eventually* you want to let go of your ego and not care so much what others think of you; ego-validation isn‚Äôt a fuel you can rely on forever, or you‚Äôll develop an unhealthy pathology. **But that‚Äôs something you can worry about a year or two from now**; right now just keep chasing that fucking validation. It‚Äôs great motivation to push yourself to improve, to push yourself to start getting laid, to work on yourself and become a better human being.

Humans care about what others think of them; that‚Äôs unavoidable. *No man is an island.* Over time as you gain confidence and start to achieve your goals, you‚Äôll naturally care less about what others think of you. You‚Äôll become more self-assured, you‚Äôll need less validation from others; your own opinion of yourself will become the most important one. But you‚Äôll still care what others think to some degree; there‚Äôs still a small part of me that cares what *you* think of *me* right now.

If you‚Äôre relatively inexperienced with girls you‚Äôll *definitely* care what they think of you. Get laid and stroke that ego and give yourself some of that much-needed validation. It‚Äôs ok to chase pussy for validation‚Ä¶ as long as you eventually work on needing a little less validation over time.

There‚Äôs a reason after all this time, after my 100-and-something lays, I still post stories and pics and videos and talk about my lays. Yes, at this point I bang girls mostly because it‚Äôs fun ‚Äì I do it 95% for myself. But there‚Äôs still 5% of me that loves the ego stroke every time [I do something cool](https://killyourinnerloser.com/nike-girl/). I love being able to tell other people about it and share in the excitement of it with them. Being excited to share your accomplishments with others ‚Äì and have them congratulate you and push you harder ‚Äì is a *normal* human need.

So the next time someone tells you to ""stop chasing validation"", tell them to *suck a fat dick.*

When you achieve something big ‚Äì you‚Äôre *supposed* to share it. You‚Äôre *supposed* to show off your achievements. Yes, don‚Äôt *only* chase validation from other people ‚Äì it‚Äôs important to give yourself some validation too. Your own opinion of yourself is always more important than the opinion of others. But you‚Äôll always still care what others think ‚Äì that‚Äôs normal.

As for ‚Äúbeing humble‚Äù ‚Äì fuck humble. You did something worth celebrating? Celebrate it. You did something most people can‚Äôt do? Give yourself a pat on the back. Share your successes with people who‚Äôll be happy for you ‚Äì especially when those successes took genuine hard work from you.

When you build a habit of sharing your successes with other people, you‚Äôll find it makes you try *harder* and push yourself *even harder* to achieve the next goal. If you know you‚Äôre going to tell your mates about your next achievement, it‚Äôll force you to go above and beyond, so there‚Äôs more of an awesome story to tell, and **so you‚Äôll get more of a pat on the back from them ‚Äì more ego validation from them.**

Ego validation makes you *more successful* ‚Äì especially at the start when you really, really, really need a little ego boost because you‚Äôre not all that sure of yourself. When you‚Äôre just starting out, every little bit of validation goes a *hell* of a long way to keeping you motivated ‚Äì **so I want you to lap up every bit of validation and ego-stroking you possibly can.**

Besides, it‚Äôs not like getting laid is *only* about ego. The very process of getting laid and improving yourself forces you to develop a tonne of other skills and traits; skills and traits that‚Äôll have a positive impact on every facet of your life. You‚Äôll have to become stronger, leaner, more focused, hard-working, more social and more open and vulnerable.

**Getting laid makes you a better man.**

I was falsley accused of rape.,"Last week, I m(21) was falsely accused of raping someone I went to university with without screenshots, proof or anything to support her tweet. Being in a fraternity didn't help my case. She posted the tweet slandering my name and my fraternity and it went viral getting over 2k retweets. I had to take down my social media and people saw this as me being guilty. I took it down because people started to share pictures of my family and because I was getting overwhelmed with threats. The damage was done so fast. The next day I got kicked out of programs, my fraternity, and lost my room I was renting (someone leaked my address online). I put everything I had in savings for a lawyer only to find out this disgusting excuse for a human being privated her tweet and went off social media herself probably because she knew she'd look like a fool when I was proved innocent. She tagged my university and told people to file complaints on me. I don't know why SHE didn't file a police report. If she truly believed I raped her she should of filed one so I could prove my innocence in court or at the very least go to my campuses title 9 office. I'm innocent but I have no proof because it didn't happen. I have no money left, no place to my name and barely any food to survive. I lost everything except my beautiful girlfriend who has been letting me stay at her place for free for the summer while I look for a new job. I want to go to civil court but have no money left. No one will believe me. She ruined me mentally, and financially. The tweet is gone but the damage is done. I am now labled a rapist to society. I want to thank my girlfriend who I will call Love. Thank you for believing me when no one else would. I am deeply heartbroken that anyone would believe I'd do such a despicable act. Thank you Love.",242,1
The Wisdom of Insecurity,"**""What is the Wisdom of Insecurity?""**

Wisdom of insecurity is a term from the late Allan watts. The book it's named after is an exploration of man's quest for psychological and intellectual certainty in religion, science and philosophy.

His main point is, by acknowledging what we do not, and cannot know; that we can learn anything truly worth knowing.

In the book he goes about saying; in order to lead a fulfilling life, we must embrace the present‚Äîand live fully in the now. However, Now; is a moment that can be filled with uncertainty. And many can't live with that feeling. So they distract themselves in a sort of orgasm without release. Chasing ""dope"" as Watts calls it. ""Hyper-reality"" stated by Jean Baudrillard. Or as the Unabomber would say ""Surrogate activities"".

As I said before people can't handle reality so they make their own. Fake tits and ass is an example butt, Video games and VR is the best example of this. However we don't live in the MCU. We live on a earth inside of the Virgo Supercluster of galaxies. Where you can't buy toilet paper and get shit on by random birds.

The Wisdom of insecurity is my favorite book I have read so far.

""... In order to chatter the more about what it thinks it knows. It fills up the uncharted spaces with mere repetition of what has already been explored"" (Allan Watts; the Wisdom of Insecurity).

History repeats itself, remember that.

It is almost as if history is afraid to differentiate itself.

We don't discuss what we don't know. For that would make us insecure. However that is how someone gets educated. People lack a proper education. Too many echo chambers exist. People need to be more insecure. I am certain of that.

‚ÄúTo resist change. To try to cling to life, is therefore like holding your breath: if you persist you kill yourself.‚Äù (Allan Watts; the Wisdom of Insecurity).

In short; I don't know, It can be harder to come up with the questions then it can be for the answers.

Thank you r/TheRedPill from a 43yo,"In my late 30s I became aware of the Red Pill sub, but sadly it did not take. At 40 I dated a 30yo single mom (wtf?) who was beautiful.

I‚Äôve had more sex with more women in the last 3 years than the previous 40. You will be surprised how many younger women like older men. It‚Äôs never too late fellas. Happiness to me is options.

Take a look at ExRedPill,"Whether you think TRP doesn't work, or if you absolutely agree with TRP, take a look at ExRedPill.

There you will find many men who never took the time to read the side bar, never worked on their mindset or body. It will be a learning experience. They will claim that TRP teaches something which is clearly disproved by the sidebar.

Bullshit like ""TRP teaches you to hate women"", ""TRP teaches you to be an emotionless machine.""

These concepts were never taught by TRP. They may have been propogated in the comment sections of TRP and askTRP by morons who never read the side bar. Morons who to this day don't understand what the real difference between Alpha and Beta is, but will use the terms to dictate to other members what their actions are classified as. They create a false impression of red pill ideas. They are the cancer of our community.


Take a look at ExRedPill. If youve been here for years and you still haven't read the side bar material, gtfo of here.

Muthafucking Astrology,"It makes me groan too, but bear with me.

What's important is that the vast majority of women believe that the arbitrary position of constellations and planets hold some power and meaning in their lives when it comes to people's personality and their relationships. There's something about the metaphysical and mystical irrationality of it all that they can't resist. Love it or hate it, this confirmation bias snake oil has persisted and matured for millennia and I don't see it dissipating any time soon.

If you plan to interact with women with the intention of escalating towards intercourse, having some surface knowledge of this BS can be handy. 
Early on while talking, she might ask you your birthday which is a simple means to determine what your main ""sign"" is. Once she knows your main sign, you are going to be viewed through that filter. If you know the more positive aspects of said sign you can emphasize its more alluring qualities to better whisk her away in some enchanted bliss. Maybe your sign is known to be good in bed, is mysterious, is adventurous, you catch my drift. If none of this is explicitly brought up, she's probably churning her hamster trying to figure out what astrological box to put you in.

Conversely, you can learn her sign and hear from the source in what respects she sees herself fitting the mold. This is all just an icebreaker at the end of the day. Sure, you are stepping into their frame, but there's no reason to be as fully consumed by the bullshit as they are. Just a little token tip of the hat can go a long way in comforting them, setting them at ease since you ""understand"" and are somewhat familiar with the opaque contours of their whimsical frames.

Granted, one can also go the hard ass route, call them on the BS and make Astrology a point of contention to get them hot and bothered. Nothing riles up the emotions like a meaningless argument. It's a risky card, you're not going to change their view, but hey, if you can see yourself slapping their booty while calling them an ""insert sign"" cunt, then why not?

If in some rarity you have stumbled across a woman who rejects astrological validity outright, she is probably of a higher mental caliber than her peers.

I hope this has provided some overlooked but nonetheless ubiquitous insight

Be wary of the fakes.,"First off this is a thank you for everyone here who've helped me avoid a ton of BS in life.

Now I know a lot of you are in the quarantine as am I. I noticed a ton of people who are gifting on the internet and in life irl who claim they are ""happy"" or ""friends"" yet they don't do the work even with given the time to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Over the time I've been reading here and applying a ton of stuff to my life I've noticed that many guys really don't understand much of this.

&amp;#x200B;

To get  this out of the way in regards to women: Yes, when you take care of yourself you will get more IOI's to state how so I got catcalled by a women yesterday and all I did was cross the street.

&amp;#x200B;

Now how this relates to other guys, a ton of let's use the container word for BP guys as Beta's will be envious of this stuff without really showing it to your face but how they behave.

&amp;#x200B;

Talking to ""old buddies"" about women really don't sit well when they are a trapped or have littleexperience. They will rationalize that you are dating only ""damaged girls"" or girls with ""Daddy issues""meanwhile they can't even talk to a girl in real life. Or they got married to the whole girl who waswilling to touch their peepee.

**Shame is also used by low value dudes.**

These can be forms of ""simpin"" when you're getting things so easily, while they have to wait (Seebelow.)

**What I've noticed with improving my life by reading, working out and getting better in making money and skills that people will try almost anything to get what they want from you.**

&amp;#x200B;

Buddy of mine wanted some work done for him, gave him a price monetary or some or other form ofpayment that would benefit me. Yet he expected for free when I make money by a side hustle that'stakes a ton of time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thirst is the worst**

&amp;#x200B;

Guys whom would always be kind to my face when out at social functions or talking through amedium will be incredibly sneaky when they see you getting what they want. Had an old friend simpso hard for an ex of mine only for him to smash her then have her cry about me to him his sister andhis social circle.

&amp;#x200B;

Would rationalize why i'm seeing a plate that was hot and younger than they could get and state ""Iwouldn't wanna be that guy"" yet would stare at her ass all night. I would try to explain to them howmaybe just maybe playing video games all night every night isn't that fun and maybe they shouldcome out with me to the city.

""But going out to talk to people is so boring so many people are stuck up!""

They would save face and say they aren't jealous at all but be in the girl's dm's and she would showme afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

Why You Aren't Translating Your Tinder Matches/Dates Into Lays,"A few days ago a young man posted on askTRP complaining how he was matching with girls and getting dates, but couldn't seem to translate those dates into sex. I'll paste the first part of his post:

&gt;I downloaded tinder and gotten some good matches. I‚Äôve gone out with 5-6 women so far in the past two weeks. Guess what?  
&gt;  
&gt;I have failed ALL of them. It‚Äôs truth pathetic and starting to feel really bad.  
&gt;  
&gt;I mean I had gotten used to failure. But at least last year when shit was normal I had successes in between, but now it‚Äôs legit 6 dates in a row where I‚Äôve been ghosted after or ignored. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had this many string of failures like ever.  
&gt;  
&gt;There‚Äôs something obviously very wrong with me and I don‚Äôt know what.

This is an extremely common issue. Posts exactly like these come up *all the fucking time.* And since I find myself repeating the same thing over and over again in response, I figure it's finally time to put this to rest in a full post.

To be sure, perhaps there was something in this guy's profile or in-person Game that gave off Beta vibes to these girls. Both should be fixed. But he could have saved himself a whole lot of trouble if he approached the app from a different mindset. 

# What is Tinder?

Let's start with the basics. Tinder is not a dating app. It's a hookup app.

That's literally what it was designed for. Are you hot or not? Would I bang or not bang? This should be obvious to everyone here. We all *know* what Tinder is, but how most guys actually *use* the app reflects their Blue Pill conditioning. They behave as if Tinder is designed for *dates.* The distinction is critical.

**Here I review how to actually get laid from Tinder in a way so straightforward and simple that even a genius couldn't mess it up.** This post is written for guys who are already getting matches, but can't seem to translate them into bangs because they overthink it. 

If you aren't getting many hot matches (e.g. at least one HB6-7+ every day), then stop reading right now and use the search function to check out the excellent profile guides written by EC mallardcove, or the one that was just posted by KillYourInnerLoser. If you're in a scarcity mindset, then you will inevitably ignore what I have to say here and go back to your ineffective Blue Pill ways. 

# What Girls Actually Want

Despite the plain fact that Tinder is a sex app, guys still draw out the seduction process into a lengthy affair. You match and message her over the course of several days. Then you eventually meet her for drinks or coffee first. Maybe bounce her from 2-3 different venues before inviting her back under some pretense, where you continue to Game her for a few hours before *finally* sealing the deal.

And that's the best case scenario. Most of the time, they don't even try for sex until the second or third date. Usually what happens is that after all that effort, she'll end up flaking away. Or the guy gets hit with ""LMR"" in the bedroom. Then he will come on here wondering what the fuck happened.

All of this nonsense comes from Blue Pill conditioning - that you need to ""get to know her"" and ""build comfort"" before coitus can occur.

Bullshit.

**Young girls in their sexual prime age 18-23 just want to hookup and have fun.** They don't ""date."" Most of them have never even been on an actual first date. It feels too contrived. To young chicks, casual fucking = dating.

The mere fact that you asked her out on a date risks making you look Beta, because Chad Thundercock isn't doing any of that shit. He's opening with ""wanna come over?"" which leads us to the next section.

# Modus Operandi for Tinder

Many of my Tinder lays have come from following a very simple playbook. I open her (or she opens me). We exchange brief lighthearted banter and establish basic compatibility. Then after 5 messages or so, I invite myself over her place to smoke weed or drink wine or some other bullshit. Once I'm there, I'm balls deep within 30 minutes.

It's important that you invite yourself to her place and not the other way around. Girls are much more comfortable with this sort of debauchery in their own domain. I have never failed to sleep with a girl after going to her place. 

The Blue Pill conditions you to believe that a hot tight 20 YO girl wouldn't possibly want a strange man to come over to her apartment, fuck the shit out of her, and then leave. The Red Pill, however, shows that not only are girls totally open to this, but they often *prefer* it.

Guys often ask *can't I just tell her flat out that I want to hookup*? No, no you can't. That's socially retarded and demonstrates that you don't understand the Game. You invite yourself to her place and she knows what's up. Communicate what you want with your actions.

# Should I Ever Invite Her On a Date First?

The one thing to know about the above strategy is that not every girl will go for it, but the girls that *do* accept are 100% down to have sex with you.

Inviting her out for drinks or whatever first will net you *more overall chances*, but a lower bang rate. If you want to meet more girls but potentially waste a lot of time, then go the date route. But if you want guaranteed sex, then go the hookup route. What you do is up to you, but don't come here whining if you bomb a few dates in a row. 

**Note:** I'll still meet her out if she asks or if the situation calls for it (e.g. she's cheating on her boyfriend, she's an au pair living with a host family, etc.)

# Move Quickly

Carpe diem. Strike while the iron is hot. You snooze, you lose. You hesitate, you masturbate.

My final admonishment for you Tinder Fuckbois is to *seize the moment*. Whether you're meeting her out or at her place, try to do it the very night that you match. At most, meet her no more than 24-72 hours later. Otherwise the opportunity is likely to slip away forever. Believe me, I've lost enough bangs by dithering. 

Women are driven by emotions. She may be hot and heavy and ready to go one night, only to turn ice cold the very next day. While some women may give you more time, your window of opportunity is finite. On Tinder, her ADD brain will flit to the next Chad that appears in her feed if you don't move quickly.

If she's responding promptly to your messages at 9 PM on a Friday and is just ""hanging out at home,"" that's a pretty good indicator that she's DTF. Escalate quickly, otherwise you'll be left with your dick in the wind.

As a wise man once said, grab 'em by the pussy.

# Conclusion

You want to know how I all know all this? It's because I've been that guy in the first part of this post. I've been that guy who didn't try to bang Tinder matches right away. I've been that guy who lost *many* lays and wasted *a lot* of time because I didn't treat Tinder like a hookup app. 

If you're getting hot matches but consistently failing to get sex, then the problem is your approach. You will have a hell of a lot more success with Tinder if you simply follow the strategy that I outline above. Tinder should be a fun diversion and an easy source of free lays, not a source of angst and frustration. **Don't make banging Tinder hoes more complicated than it has to be.**",164,1

Reject the Modern World,"Most of you mgtow folk are christ followers so here's a line from the good book. 'Be in the world but not of it.' Couldn't have said it better myself.

The modern western world is a disgusting, putrid pit. Because we confused with going forward with becoming better, we have sacrificed happiness, a centeredness with the world around us, and a better quality of life on the altar of progression. Life isn't about what you make anymore, it's a contest to see how many Marvel movies you can watch. How many woke points you can score on social media. How many gone wild butt sluts you can schmooze onto your dick before you die. Lives are now centered around consumption rather than creation.


How do we stop it? Well, you can't. Accelerationism is the only way for the west to be cured. But you can't do anything about that so just ignore it for now. Here's some ideas for how you can stop feeling like a brainless consoomer.

1. Learn survival skills

If the power grid fails, so do you, unless you've been planing on it for a long time.

2. Get out of urban areas

Just because all the women are in NYC doesn't mean you have to be. Move upstate and go into the city to fuck occasionally. Cities are disease-ridden hell holes where everyone breaths in the same air while polluting it with smog. Everything is more expensive and all you get in return is a sense of elitism. Move to the woods or some shit.


3. Make something

Anything. Woodworking. Welding. Tapestry. Anything that you make with your hands is automatically cooler than anything you've bought. Cooler than your fancy car, actually. Most Americans will never create anything. By making a wooden duck decoy you catapult yourself above the gen pop. Also, if you have to tie everything back to sex, chicks dig a guy who can kill them with a handsaw.

4. Stop buying gay ass products.

Stop it. Stop going to capeshit. Stop staring at your phone for 90 hours a week. Stop gaming. Stop eating soyshit. Life isn't about what dumb products you consoomed today. Become better than a corporation and it's blood sucking parasites.

5. Become very ripped 

Zero reason not to get ripped. Don't want to go to gym because you're poor? Do pushups. Fuck it, lift a big rock over your head. You have zero reason not to be a giant jacked monster. Socrates said a man was a failure if he never saw himself in peak physical form before he died.

TLDR: the secret to pussygetting is stop eating soy, that's the secret kids. Also quit touching receipts and read Mike Ma and Bronze Age Pervert and Industrial Society. That's all.",66,1

Help I‚Äôm in Love,"

I‚Äôve been dating this girl and spinning plates while I‚Äôve been seeing her but man I think I‚Äôm starting to fall in love with her. She‚Äôs everything I want in a girl and I feel guilty when I‚Äôm with my other plates. I know this is getting to be oneitis so I was hoping for some advice from this sub on what to do. Should I keep spinning plates even when she‚Äôs asked to go exclusive? I‚Äôm obviously not gonna tell her I love her even though she‚Äôs said it but this is my first love after taking TRP and I don‚Äôt want to screw it up. I feel like if I keep spinning plates and doing what I‚Äôve been doing she‚Äôs going to ask for more and eventually leave if I don‚Äôt offer that to her. But on the other hand spinning plates and being that asshole has gotten me this girl and if I stop and get oneitis won‚Äôt that mess everything up? Cause then I‚Äôll be in her frame. I‚Äôm just unsure on what to do",0,1
"How to build real confidence: If you can handle pain, you can handle anything.","The punchline is near the bottom.

I won‚Äôt pretend to know everything. But as long as I can help at least one guy on here, I‚Äôll be happy.

I‚Äôm in my very late twenties, and I leave for Marine Corps boot camp soon. I joined late in life because I wasn‚Äôt eligible when I was younger. Getting prepared for it at my age and initial fitness level was an astronomical challenge. I was relatively fat, lazy, and was working at a sedentary job selling car insurance.

I went through *grueling*, tear-inducing workouts, both on my own and with my recruiters. I worked out in single digit temperatures, rainy days, and scorching heat. I‚Äôve puked. I bled. I even cried once. Some days I was motivated. Some days I just wanted to straight up quit. I gave myself excuses ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm just too old‚Äù. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm just not getting better.‚Äù 

But I kept showing up. 

Near the end of my preparation, the truth was right there written in some progress notes I had written down, and I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes. My initial fitness test was being able to run a mile in 19 minutes and couldn‚Äôt do a single pull up.

Now I can do a *mile and a half* in 12 minutes, 6 pull ups, and lost about 35lbs. 

The punchline:

I used to always think confidence came from failure. That‚Äôs partly true. But I think confidence comes from your ability to handle **pain**, which may or may not come from failure. But to take it even further, I think confidence comes from your *willingness* to face that pain. Because if you‚Äôre willing to face anything, you‚Äôll be ‚Äúprepared‚Äù for anything, if that makes sense. It makes you feel confident, calm, and ready.

I‚Äôve been cheated on. I‚Äôve faced humiliating defeat in competitions. I‚Äôve failed teammates, co-workers, and friends. I‚Äôve been manipulated and emotionally abused by my oh-so loving mother. I‚Äôve faced failure in so many areas of life, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here writing this post. Because those experiences induced some serious pain. But as a Morpheus quote once said: **I remember that I am here not because of the path that lies before me, but because of the path that lies behind me.**

Take it all with a grain of salt. I‚Äôm not an expert. I‚Äôm not some 80 year old giving advice. I‚Äôm just someone who‚Äôs been through an astronomical amount of physical and emotional pain, but I know it helped me achieve the peace I needed to face boot camp confidently.

[Bronze Age Mindset] - What is the DARK ENLIGHTENMENT?,"**This post is part of a series covering [BRONZE AGE MINDSET](https://amzn.to/2Ao5uRB). This post is a bit of an off-shoot, covering a philosophy that I consider BAP-adjacent- today we‚Äôll be taking a look at [THE DARK ENLIGHTENMENT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLHQBgWnRIA&amp;list=LLdozTkECcktXMeSsBwRb-CQ&amp;index=2&amp;t=9s).**
___

**If BRONZE AGE MINDSET can be reduced to its main theme, and the number one take-away, it would be that BAP considers the emergence of the [bug-man](https://www.reddit.com/r/BronzeAgePervert/comments/hiqprx/bronze_age_mindset_the_bugman_defined/) to be the central ill of modernity and rallies against all the bug stands for: total consumption.** This complete disregard of all that is traditionally masculine has allowed for a [neoliberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism) system to reign over mindless, idiot consumers. 

Bronze Age Mindset was published in 2018- in 2020 we're seeing an intense acceleration in this system taking hold and destroying all enemies. Speech is more highly regulated by tech company oligarchs, and a strict belief in the inherent goodness of equality- as measured in the *equality of outcomes*- are all but made mandatory by gunpoint.

In this post, we'll take a quick overview of the origins of this slipperly slope that will get hot as fucking hell over the nect decade- for this, we'll need to start at the Protestant Reformation.

**Conservatives are lame idiots.** You may know this already, or you may think conservatives are *the good guys* fighting for all that is *good and right*. Conservatives will often spout rhetoric about taking America ""back to the 50s,"" but I ask you this- were the 50s truly different enough? Were things already set in motion that would always, inherently, inevitably lead to what we see today? **The Dark Enlightenment is anti-conservative- when we say we want to ""take things back to the 50s,"" we mean the 1450s...**

Sounds crazy, right? Weren't people *uneducated savages* back then? 

Let's start with what the **Protestant Reformation** changed. Martin Luther (1481-1546) was the first progressive! His idea was that the church should not be a hierarchy of clergy but a ""community of believers."" Instead of a descension of authority from God --&gt; Church --&gt; people, Luther suggested that all Christians should have their own, individual, direct connection to God, thereby deconstructing social hierarchy and establishing the first notions of *equality*!

Now, what's that they say about a *[slippery slope](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/slippery%20slope)*?

Following Luther, the puritans gained influence in England- think of them as the Social Justice Warriors of their day. Very strongly anti-monarchy- which paved the way for **Oliver Cromwell, a general who signed the death warrant for King Charles in 1649.** This was not something done prior to the Protestant Reformation. But suddenly, the idea of rigid hierarchy (the only kind with legitimacy!) fell out of fashion- and, suddenly, if people didn't like the King in charge...... well.

Fast forward about a hundred years, and we get to talk about the naughty children of the **American Revolution.** The actual conflict of the revolution was Whigs, who favored democracy, and Jacobites, who were loyal monarchists. What they don't tell you in high school was that there were ""heroes on both sides,"" to grab a line from the Episode 3 crawl... in other words, the sides weren't exactly *black and white,* America vs. England- each side had their share of Whigs and Jacobites- most notably, British General William Howe was a known Whig. Hmmmmmm!

I am not an expert on the hidden details of the American Revolution, but I just ordered the book Moldbug recommends as a starting point: **""[The True History of the American Revolution](https://amzn.to/2VKG481)""**- so this will be an issue I'll revisit.

Coming out of the American Revolution was, of course, the Declaration of Independence- featuring the line ""All Men are Created Equal.""

Boy are slippery slopes super slippery! In a few hundred years we went from solely our relationship with God being universal and equal, to *all men* being *created equal.* See where this is going?

**A C C E L E R A T I O N**

Next up, kids, we have the **French Revolution (1789-1799)**! And, what do we know about the French Revolution? OFF WITH THEIR HEADS! The French Revolution was about the abolition of the French monarchy. The core tenants of the French Revolution were Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity- or, in other words, the ideas stemming from the Enlightenment. During the French Revolution we see a formal declaration of the *rights of women* (where could this be going? [hmmm](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FUczcvZKJ2yi1n8BFJq4s8HpKa8=/0x0:2048x1536/1400x1400/filters:focal\(692x49:1018x375\):format\(jpeg\)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52863739/Vagina_lady.1485099571.jpg)).

Comparatively, the American Revolution almost comes across as adorable. **The French punished dissidents with death.** Sound familiar? And we've still got two-hundred years to go!

Quick break first, though- two questions. What end-goal does Darth Vader want Luke to help him accomplish in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980)? And who is the biggest genocidal, mass-murderer in Star Wars? Let's come back to this a little later.

Next we have the **Russian Revolution**, which overthrew the Czar of Russia and further pushed a Social Justice agenda. Homosexuality was decriminalized here and Feminism was more formalized with the introduction of ""International Woman's Day"" in 1917! Now you can make friends at work by telling them you refuse to celebrate a Communist holiday! (no, don't really do this).

Shortly after we had **World War 2** which established the Soviet Union and the United States as the world's superpowers. Promoted as polar opposites- but, I wonder, were they really? **The Soviets were revolutionary marxists- more of a hot culture war- but over in America, we had the kettle simmering on low with *[cultural marxism](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cultural%20Marxism)*- a cold culture war.**

**THE RELIGION OF P R O G R E S S IV IS M**

The eventual fall of the Soviet Union brought us to where we are today- what started with the Protestant Reformation has become the new Religion. Understand this, a religion does not need to have a God-figure sitting at the head of the table- way too much hierarchy in a religion of *equality*! The God-figure of the Progressive religion is the ideas of **universal equality, democracy, and diversity.** Say what you want- do what you want- but these principles *cannot be questioned.*

Like old religions, the religion of progressivism has transgression, sin, and heresy! The original, unwashable sin of progressivism is to be white, male, and heterosexual.... was the old, *prior to May of 2020* way of thinking. Looks like white chicks are on the shit list now [too](https://spectator.us/viral-justice-demented-war-karens-karlos-dillard/)!

Like old religions, there is also the need for purity and redemption. Bizarre [rituals](https://www.lowellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/LOW-L-protestLHS277-1.jpg?w=570) to cleanse one's self of whiteness.

Like old religions, there are heresy accusations. We see viral videos used as public scarlet letters- which result in all but formalized exile. Unpersoning from social media platforms, and video services, without government intervention (despite having OMG HITLER X 1000 sitting on the throne.... oh, now don't you wish it were a throne!?).

**W E L CO ME TO H E L L** 

In our modern, globalist neoliberal world that took hold after the collapse of the Soviet Union- we are not ruled by a King or an explicit aristocracy, but one that is implicit and hiding in plain sight. **This conglomeration of modern oligarchs have been referred to as The Cathedral** because they are only *theoretically separate* entities that have the same ideology and end-goals- **they are the government (the least important of the grouping, ironically), academia, the media, and corporations/tech.** Although ""separate"" you will see these entities acting in unison. It was only in 2008 that Barack Obama was [against](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150626213815-rainbow-white-house-super-tease.jpg) gay marriage... and [now](https://twitter.com/WokeCapital?s=20).

Think of it like this- ten years ago, could you imagine losing your job for a tweet? And now? **This is where we are, right now- the wrong move, in public or private, will unperson you and all but kill you... the next step is imprisonment for ""hate speech,"" and then death.**

**The Right always loses.** Hope this isn't new for you, but if it is, let's talk Star Wars instead. What's Darth Vader's end-goal- what makes the Empire so evil? He wants to bring *order to the Galaxy.* Order. What was the start of all of this? What was identified as the true evil of the world, and started off this slippery slope which resulted in blood-shed and thought control. A distaste for order... hierarchy. This is, and always has been, considered the *true modern evil* of Progressivism. 

And who is the true mass-murderer of the galaxy? Well, of course, it's a tie! The Empire had its hand pushed to destroy Alderaan- who knows what ultimate chaos (the opposite of order!) the galaxy would become without the structure of the Empire?! It was collateral damage! But how many people did Luke kill when he blew up with moon-sized Death Star? Maybe not quite as many, but certainly in the tens of thousands. Do we spent even a frame of Star Wars considering how many people Luke has [killed](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/the-case-for-the-empire)? No! We're more considered with a walking dog not getting a medal!

**The lesson: actions are not judged, only ideologies are judged.**       

Remember this as we all head to the gulag or the guillotine- whichever comes first.

The More I Let Go Of Society‚Äôs Moral Values The Better My Life Became,"I used to follow society‚Äôs hidden rules to a T. Never talk too loud. Always be humble. Be nice to women. Get a good job at a big company. 

It got me nowhere. I was a 29 year old virgin stuck in a boring corporate job I hated.

I used to look down on salespeople. I thought I was better than them because I had ‚Äúreal‚Äù technical skills and knowledge in accounting and all they had was thick skin and the ability to handle rejection.

Now I know it‚Äôs the complete opposite. They‚Äôre the ones that were actually generating revenue for my company and this irreplaceable while I‚Äôm just another expense on the balance sheet.

It seems that there are still a number of people here that think they can be a traditional good person (in Judeo Christian terms) and still be RedPill. This is completely wrong in my opinion.

The more selfish I became, the more I received from the world.

The more cunning and manipulative I became in my conversations, the more people respected me and did what I wanted them to do.

The more ruthless I became with who I cut out from my life, the higher the quality of my relationships and friendships.

Some of the most important skills I learned were from studying psychopaths and sociopaths. Mirroring, making the other person feel you truly understand them. Hypnotic tone of voice, getting people into a relaxed, suggestive state where you can implant thoughts into their mind. Real objections dealing, fake empathy, the list goes on and on.

There is so much unbelievable knowledge out there for sales and persuasion that people are too afraid to tap into for fear of becoming a bad person.

No, people are not stupid. It takes a high level of skill to lie convincingly but the returns are well worth the effort.

It dawned on me that everything society taught me was a lie. The real world is the complete opposite.

Let go of your morals. They‚Äôre holding you back from your full potential.",107,1

Worship of Meaning: MGTOW and the Triumph of the Blue Pill,"My friend ""Nick"" is one of the hawtest guys that I know. Dark-skinned, handsome, muscled and ripped like a motherfucker. The type of guy who would get a thousand (hot) matches on Tinder a month and act like it's no big deal...like scrolling through a menu of options on Uber Eats, who cares?

I can already sense the incels and Blackpillers frothing at the mouth. This guy is banging every Stacey and Jessica, I have no chance, woe is me, I'll never get laid and all the rest of the sorry tale.

But what if I told you that Nick rarely bangs any of these hoes? And no, he's not a *fag* you dumb cunt - he just doesn't exercise his powers as much as you would think.

In fact, many hawt guys that I know are like this. For years I've tried to figure out why my own n-count is far higher than Nick and these other Chads. Religion and upbringing play a role, certainly. But the reason that I hear the most is some variation of the following:

*What's the point in getting girls, I'd rather spend that time doing something productive and meaningful.*

This sentiment shows up more and more now on this sub these days, especially among younger guys. At first I simply dismissed it as more MGTOW hamstering. It's one of the oldest tricks in the book - you can't get something, so just pretend you don't want it in the first place. It's like that asshat who brags that he wouldn't bang Margot Robbie or Rihanna or whoever...as if he could.

The problem with that explanation is that it doesn't apply to guys like Nick who are perfectly capable of getting girls. Nick's problem is definitely not low self-esteem or low ability. Indeed, he's one of the most conventionally confident guys that I know - popular and socially skilled, as one would expect a Chad to be.

No, the problem is a curious new phenomenon: **the worship of ""meaning"".**

It is the idea that any time not spent doing something ""productive"" or ""meaningful"" is a waste. Watching sports? Waste of time. Having sex? Waste of time. Enjoying a movie? Waste of time.

These guys fancy themselves the next Nikola Tesla, renouncing all Earthly pleasures...as if the greatest genius of modern times wasn't a total [poon hound](https://medium.com/@editors_91459/turns-out-einstein-was-a-cold-hearted-misogynist-who-attempted-to-control-his-wifes-every-move-c3f1ff70bf8c), or that the likes of Jack Kennedy, LBJ, Clinton, and Trump weren't out banging everything that moved, or that the [greatest actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando) of all-time didn't compile extensive notes on seduction and his innumerable sexual conquests long before PUA ever existed, or that the [creator](http://www.forcematerial.com/home/2017/1/28/the-car-crash-that-changed-the-galaxy) of the most celebrated nerd franchise ever didn't spend much of his youth driving around in his hotrod chasing tail and getting laid (which later inspired his first hit film).

I could go on. It suffices to say that these great men took a holistic view of life. Before the business gurus, MGTOWs, and other assorted fuckheads began smearing the cultural landscape with their feces, it was simply taken for granted that a man would act like a man. Clearly there is no positive correlation between this bizarre new aestheticism and personal achievement. So why is it so widespread?

Welcome to the Blue Pill, my MGTOW friends. You never left.

This worship serves two purposes in our dual Blue Pill/capitalist society. It keeps the population believing that the highest purpose is to generate more value for ~~owners~~ society, and it also keeps otherwise attractive men from taking more than their fair share of the women.

The worship of meaning does appeal to the MGTOW set, though, because it certainly *sounds* like Red Pill. We talk about purpose and mission, but this generation that is coming up after the millennials takes everything so fucking literally.

From an early age, guys are being conditioned out of normal male desires by appealing to their sense of masculine purpose. There is no such thing anymore as simply having fun with girls. Everything must have ""purpose"" and ""meaning."" Guys walk around with sticks up their asses, unable to just relax and enjoy life. Pleasure cannot be an end unto itself under this new paradigm. Admit to enjoying the game, and you're a loser, a Beta, and so on.

Ask yourself, who does that *really* serve?

The worship of meaning is fantastic for Blue Pill society. It's why someone like Jordan Peterson was allowed to break into the mainstream, despite attacking feminism. The idea that you should abstain from ""meaningless"" pleasure, hunker down, and build yourself into the perfect male specimen dovetails nicely with that other odious Blue Pill offshoot...**building a better Beta.**

By the time these men complete their 20-year monk mode and are ready to start a family...something that *does* have purpose (how convenient!)... they'll be in the unenviable position of possessing lots of material resources but very little experience with women. They will enter marriage/LTR and fatherhood without the adult social skill set that is honed over many years of gaming women.

As far as my own selfish ends are concerned, I'm happy to let these men slide into this MGTOW/Blue Pill condition. More pussy for me.

In case you were still entertaining the idea of being monogamous/marrying and why it‚Äôs so important to spin plates.,"
I came across a sub (adultery) by browsing another users comments, and decided to take a look. There‚Äôs a thread comprised of mostly married women, pinging ideas and adulterous experiences off of one another.

In the thread, it‚Äôs a collective sharing of excuses used when the person in question wants to go cheat. I encourage you to look at some of those excuses..donating blood and volunteering at a homeless shelter are two that stuck out to me.
I attempted to link the thread bot wouldn‚Äôt allow, if posting it in the comments won‚Äôt break and sub rules, I will.

Why is this important? If you‚Äôre entertaining the idea of an LTR or marriage, this is the reality. There‚Äôs a high probability of her cheating and when she does, you won‚Äôt even know (at least for awhile), because she‚Äôs just out ‚Äúhelping the homeless‚Äù.

This is why it‚Äôs so important to spin plates. Over time a lot of guys here have misconstrued the idea of spinning plates to mean specifically, having sex with multiple women. In a situation like this, it‚Äôs important to do it the way Rollo described and intended it to be; to be constantly gaming other women so that you are in a constant state of abundance. 

This doesn‚Äôt mean necessarily having sex with them, which I‚Äôd recommend against if you‚Äôre in an LTR, even more so if you‚Äôre married. Simply be gaming and improving 24/7 and cultivate that abundance mindset.",170,1

Dominance hierarchies,"#Introduction

-------------------------

I have seen a lot of posts about self-confidence and how to boost it. While most posts go in the right direction and advise things that will work, no post I've seen so far actually explains the science behind self-confidence. 

Note: The ones of you that know Jordan Peterson and have read his ""12 Rules For Life"" will recognize a lot of things I talk about here.

#Body

**Lobsters**

Lobsters are interesting creatures. They live in ""houses"", which are basically little caves. Some caves are better than others, because they're bigger, better protected etc. Because of this, lobsters often fight each other. The winning lobster will get the cave, and the other lobster will retreat. When a lobster loses a fight, something interesting happens: his serotonin levels decrease. Because of this, the lobster will literally hunch over more, making himself smaller, so others won't attack him. It's also more likely, that he will not fight another lobsters. If you give a lobster, that has lost a fight, some anti-depressants (which basically increase the serotonin in his system), he will go right back and fight the other lobster again with more confidence. His body posture will also change, he will go more upright. 

Lobsters live in dominance hierarchies. They know exactly where in the hierarchy they are. The lower a lobster is, the more nervous he is. He is more anxious, he turns down fights, he walks with a more defensive posture, he doesn't even try to attract the ladies, he becomes literally depressed. Because he is low in the hierarchy, he doesn't have a nice, secure home. He also knows that the ""alpha lobsters"" will fight him for everything he has, if they want to have it. Because of that he is constantly nervous and insecure, because he could lose everything he has in a blink of an eye, and he couldn't do anything against it.

Lobsters that are higher up in the hierarchy feel secure. They know that they will win fights, so they know they can defend their home. The lady lobsters see the nice homes they have, and will choose to pair with them. So the alpha lobsters don't even need to try to attract the females. They feel self-confident. Literally. 

**Humans**

You will already have realized some parallels between lobsters and us humans. But why did we choose lobsters to observe those tendencies? Because lobster brains are very similar to ours, but massively more simple. The neurons are very big, so they're easy to map out and examine. 

The problem with the analogy is this; men don't fight each other anymore for their stuff and for their place in the dominance hierarchy. That's why we have developed a pretty smart system in our brains, that constantly scans how other people treat us, and then decides where in the hierarchy we currently are. If other people treat you nicely, respect your words, ask for your opinion, don't insult you etc., your brain will begin to think ""I must be pretty high in the hierarchy here"". If other people walk over you and generally don't care about your existence, you will think, that you're low in the hierarchy (because you are). 

This becomes a downward/upward spiral. When you're high in the hierarchy, you will (unconsciously) walk more upright, be braver, more assertive... Because you feel strong. The primitive part of your brain knows, that if someone were to fight you, you would defeat them. This in turn means, that other people will treat you even better, women will love you, you will not have to do anything for female attention, thus rising your status even more. You will more likely be able to withstand temptations like drugs and other short term gratifications, because you feel save, you will plan for your future, because why not?

When you're low in the hierarchy, the opposite happens. You will walk more and more hunched over, trying to seem small. You will be afraid of social interactions, because your brain tells you, that other people could attack you at any time, and they would also win. You will not speak up for yourself, you will live more and more in the NOW, because maybe you will be dead tomorrow, because someone very strong decided to fight you. You will be more susceptible to instant gratification, making everything even worse. 

When you're on the lower end, you won't get attacked currently by other men, because we have evolved as a species. But the primitive part of your brain will still expect it all the time. This is a very stressful situation. 

Now what could a low-hierarchy men do? Well obviously you need to raise your perceived status. And that's where the other posts get many things right. If you go to the gym to get ripped and start walking more upright, other people will treat you with more respect. This means, that your brain will tell you ""hey look, they treat you nicer, this means you're climbing the hierarchy"". 

What will also help? Stability. Remember, a low-hierarchy lobster will live in a constant state of fear and uncertainty. He is very unstable, because not even his little, pathetic cave is save. Nowadays you won't get attacked, and you won't lose all of your belongings when you're on the low end. This means this fear is irrational (more or less). If you build yourself some stability in your life, you will inevitably feel higher in the hierarchy. What kind of stability? Any. Literally any. Get in the habit of getting up on the first alarm in the morning. Make your bed directly after getting up. Do this every morning. You will begin to feel more stable. Develop micro-routines. Get up at the same time, go to bed at the same time, eat more or less at the same time, choose a day a week to clean your room/apartment, track your macros, brush your teeth 3 times a day... Anything. Those are all things you can start doing TODAY. You don't need anything you don't already have.

These things may seem mundane, not-that-important, boring. But they are incredibly important and powerful.  

Climb the dominance-hierarchy. Trick your brain into being more self-confident. Become an alpha lobster.

Warren Ferrell‚Äôs Life: A Case Study on the Gradual Pervasiveness of Feminism over the Past 50 Years,"**Summary:**  Warren Ferrell is a name that pops up occasionally in the manosphere, including in The Red Pill documentary. I decided to do a quick research dive to see who this guy is and what he teaches. While he certainly is not Red-Pilled, several important lessons can be derived from this man‚Äôs work and his treatment by society.

**Body:**  

Warren Ferrell is a professor &amp; author who got a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in social science, and earned his PhD in political science from NYU in 1974. He first rose to prominence as a supporter of 2nd-wave feminism, writing NY Times articles and appearing on several talk shows. He was also on the Board of Directors for the National Organization for Women (NOW) in New York City. His main goal was to break down traditional gender roles and encourage more flexible roles for the future. He encouraged people to participate in experiments such as ‚Äúmen‚Äôs beauty contests‚Äù and ‚Äúrole reversal dates‚Äù to foster understanding of the other sex‚Äôs experiences.

Ferrell‚Äôs first riff against feminism came in the mid 70s. NOW recently announced their opposition to joint custody in divorce proceedings (hmmm, I wonder why?). Dr. Ferrell was shocked that a group supposedly fighting for equality of the sexes would hold this position. When he spoke out against this, it caused tension between him and the other board members. Eventually, he left the board in order to follow his strong, independent wife to Washington DC to advance her career. They divorced a few years later. 

Over the next \~45 years, Ferrell published several books on intersexual issues, some of which have brilliantly disproven popular feminist axioms (*The Myth of Male Power* \- 1993, *Why Men Earn More* \- 2005), or laid out male struggles that are ignored by the media (*The Boy Crisis* \- 2018). However, the key flaw in Ferrell‚Äôs thinking is this: He believes that traditional gender roles are social constructions that need to be broken down, whereas in reality there is a biological basis for them. Women (even if they don‚Äôt admit it) are attracted to ‚Äòtraditionally‚Äô masculine qualities: strong, high status, emotionally callous, strong frame, etc. Likewise, men are attracted to ‚Äòtraditionally‚Äô feminine qualities: good-looking, gentle, caring, etc. Instead of acknowledging this, Ferrell is hopelessly striving for egalitarian equalism where construction &amp; STEM fields are 50% women, nurses &amp; caretakers are 50% men, and women are the primary breadwinners in 50% of homes. 

In another book of his, *Women Can‚Äôt Hear What Men Don‚Äôt Say* (2005), he posits that most problems in marriages result from lack of open and honest communication (mostly from men). No Dr. Ferrell, the problem is not that men aren‚Äôt saying their problems, the problem is that women don‚Äôt listen. The instant a man starts being vulnerable about his problems and unresolved emotional conflicts, his wife/gf starts looking to branch swing to a guy who doesn‚Äôt have these issues, and therefore can keep her safe. This is just female nature, so it‚Äôs not worth getting mad at them for it, but Dr. Ferrell‚Äôs book in this case is harmfully misleading at best.

**Lessons Learned:** 

Dr. Ferrell‚Äôs story illustrates a few things very clearly:

1. There has been a dramatic cultural shift towards feminism from the beginning of the sexual revolution to today. Ferrell‚Äôs positions on gender issues have remained roughly stationary over time, while cultural views have moved so dramatically to the left that Ferrell has changed from being classified as a feminist to essentially being a Men‚Äôs Rights Activist. 

2. The goal of feminism is NOT equality, but advancing the feminine imperative. As CH states, feminism is about removing all constraints on female sexuality while maximally restricting male sexuality. Since the 60s, feminists have been feigning a fight for equality while pursuing the aforementioned objective.

One final note: this post is not intended to be a criticism of Ferrell‚Äôs character, just his ideas. He has been laudably taking stands against various feminist teachings since the 1970s, and did not have the advantage of internet forums where thousands of men aggregate their experience to develop theories. The Feminist Machine merely used him when he was of value, and unapologetically discarded him when his teachings began running counter to its interests.",18,1

A survey of the scientific evidence finds overwhelming proof of 'male disposability',"Numerous studies show that people are more willing to inflict harm on men than women, more willing to kill men than women, and treat harm against men as less serious than harm against women. Women treat men as less valuable to a greater degree than men, and women who identify as feminists may be even more sexist than women on average. These attitudes are promoted by women to their children, but not by men.

Significant examples include the ""trolley Problem"" where subjects are 7 times more likely to throw a man off a bridge to save others than a woman, and a variant of the Milgram experiment, where participants subjected men to greater electric shocks than women.

There is also evidence that suggest male disposability is a result of social conditioning, not instinct. The effect is larger if the subject is being watched than not, people report it is more socially acceptable to harm men than women.

The effect is also larger for the case of who to save on a sinking ship, where participants said 60:1 that it should be women first over men first.

"Why there is no biological justification for having children: You are not ""spreading your genes"", rather your genes are spreading *you* thin","This argument comes up again and again, usually from conservative readers: *""I want to have kids in order to spread my genes.""*

None of these guys understands how evolution works. Here's how it goes:

There are three candidates for the level where evolution works: 

1) the Genes, 

2) the Individual, and 

3) the Group. 

Out of them, evolution works only on level 1 and 3, i.e. *evolution only works on the level of Genes and Groups, not on Individuals*.

The fact that evolution does not work on Individuals is self evident, of course, but many choose to let it pass through their conscious detection (i.e. they fool themselves).

It's *our genes* that get propagated by evolution not ""our self"". Our self dies. A lot of our behavior has been programmed in order for these little bastards to propagate themselves - and that, *during the evolutionary period*, not today.

So, for instance, even though you might be fully conscious that *you don't ever want to have children*, even if you have a vasectomy, your lithic-era programming makes you want to fuck women. *They*, i.e. your genes, think they will propagate, thus making *you* chase pussy. It's all subconscious.

Now really, the best way to propagate ""your"" genes today is becoming a sperm donor. But hardly anyone claiming ""I want to propagate my genes"" turns the world upside down in order to become a sperm donor. Why is that? Is it just hypocrisy? 

Well, yes, it is, but they don't even realize it. They want to have ""their"" children, and ""raise them right"", etc etc etc. This means, they have internalized societal expectations, mixed them up with their psychological expectations and insecurities (I don't want to die alone, I want to have someones to look up to me, I want to be loved), mixed them up with what *their genes wanted them to do back in the primeval era*, and produced this haphazard ""ideology"". It is even mainstream.

So, 

1) The way to ""spread your genes"" today is to become a sperm donor. (In case you haven't caught it yet, I'm just saying that ironically, because they are not *your* genes, *you* are theirs).

2) If you want family and kids, that's what you want: family and kids. *You* don't want to ""spread your genes"". You don't *get* to want to spread your genes. It makes no sense. *You* are a vehicle for *your genes* to spread themselves. 

Now, family and kids isn't even the way genes were spread during the evolutionary adaptedness period. *Genes are spread with one way: fucking.* 

I hope I'm being clear here: I'm not (in this post) arguing against having kids per se. I'm arguing that having kids, even more in today's social setup, is not about spreading your genes. It is something that you, for whatever reasons, legitimate or illegitimate, have been driven to desire.

So this took a bit longer that I planned, so I'm not going to go at length onto how evolution works in the Group level. (Short story: when a groups survives, its gene pool survives. That's because groups do survive. Individuals don't.)

TRP concludes ""don't marry"" for several good reasons. I hope that by making the issue about reproduction a bit clearer, I can make this conclusion clearer for some of you guys.

The Shared Alpha,"
So, I‚Äôm not usually one to share field reports because 1) I hate to type all this shit out and 2) there‚Äôs always a few AFC‚Äôs that come out of the woodwork to call BS, since it won‚Äôt happen to them, it couldn‚Äôt happen to anybody I guess.

But this is a good one, and a testament to TRP, female nature and a class A evidence of the notion that women would rather share an Alpha than have a Beta to themselves.

TLDR at the bottom for all the ADD fuckers. 

A little over a year ago, March 2019 to be exact, I was living in Florida and had just started a new job serving at an upscale seafood restaurant. There‚Äôs a hostess named Kora, if memory serves me she was 44, slim blonde woman that didn‚Äôt look hideous, but the wall definitely took its piece of her.

I start the job and all is smooth, normal shit. I‚Äôm invited one day to grab drinks with some coworkers and of course, I oblige. We hit the bar across the street and start getting wasted, I‚Äôll spare you the details but basically it ended up being just me and Kora left as everyone else went home. The whole night she kept touching me and I knew she was into me, originally I said no to myself but then you know how it is...I said fuck it, I‚Äôll do it for the sport.

We make out at the bar, go get a hotel and we fuck. Pretty normal lay, nothing special. 

Fast forward a few days later, I‚Äôm getting off of work at 4 and so is she, her 18yo daughter comes to pick her up and I immediately want to bone this chick. Skinny with brown hair, face a lil ehh but I have a fetish for skinny girls so. Kora invites me to go to her place to drink and play card games with her 2 daughters, the 18yo and another one that was early 20s.

To save story length here I‚Äôll cut to the chase, we all get wasted, the early 20s daughter passed out and the 18yo kept complaining about her ex. I was about to leave cause it was lame but then started to get a sexual vibe when she would talk to me about her ex. Saying shit like ‚Äúmaybe I just need to try older guys‚Äù. 

Now preface to this, in the process of us all getting drunk, Kora blatantly talked about us fucking and neither daughter looked surprised, which means they all knew/talked about it.

At some point I go outside with the 18yo to smoke and we start making out. Kora started acting nutty, coming outside saying shit like ‚Äúyou fucking asshole, I know you want to fuck her too‚Äù. At one point she even bit me, lol.

After a good hour we get the mom to chill out and she drives me home (bad idea considering she was 18 and drunk, w/e). Once we get to my place we‚Äôre sitting in the car and I run normal game. Eventually we get in the backseat ready to fuck, the last thing she said before I entered her was ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you fucked my mom‚Äù while covering her face.

We had some dirty sex then just chilled out talking. The next day she hmu saying she liked me but the whole thing with her mom was too weird for her and we shouldn‚Äôt see each other again. No prob with me.

Main Point?

Women will ALWAYS share an alpha, even if it‚Äôs mother/daughter. Hypergamy drives them to seek top male seed, this is why some of the top posters in TRP have OLTRs. Women don‚Äôt give a fuck, their lizard brain just wants alpha male seed.


TLDR: Fucked a milf then fucked her daughter a week later. They both know knew about the other. Fucking women man, I tell ya",94,1
How to get Laid: Collectors Edition,"# Part l : Getting the women

Tinder, Instagram, and occasionally real life are the habitats of the female homo sapiens. Lucky for you I am one of the many pussy detectives on TRP.  Tinder and Instagram relies on your pictures. So work on getting good pictures. Borrow your moms camera 4k canon, worked for me.

Now, the real life habitat is tricky. For some men they've never seen a women in real life. An exotic creature indeed. With my reading and extensive research I have discovered a legendary technique. To approaching women in the wild. Here it is:

I walk up to them eyes locked on, Staring at her left nostril (asserting dominance) I point my left foot 32 degrees away from her. Showing I am interested but not that invested. Then I say the magic word ""Hi"" 

If you want the rest check out my secret seduction course NOW 48% OFF!!!!

# Part II: Text Game

Alright, so you got the female homo sapiens number. Congratulations. Text game is very difficult to master. Some say ""Text logistics"" Some say ""Flirt over text to warm her up"". However with my extensive knowledge and research I have developed a method.

I call her; setup the date and/or fuck her with my diction  

You don't have to be there to be in there. ;)

# Part III: Getting fucked

Now with some women flaking, you've finally found your specimen to test your knowledge.

 Your on the date. She's sitting across from you at a Taco bell. Interesting choice my friend I prefer Wendy's it gives the date a flame. But I understand you plan to put your meat in her taco.

Using my seductive course you know to let the women talk more than you. You keep your words to  minimum. Good job. You and the subject finish eating. You then offer her an invitation for drinks at your place.  She says ""No, I have to fuck chad""

You then proceed to say ""fine"" and go on askTRP, asking why?

You sit in the rain, listing to k-pop; thunder strikes....

u/Larper1dickchiney comments:

&gt; You acted too beta! Read the sidebar!! lol askTRP destroys my soul.

Now feeling lost you now read the rational male. You study long and hard the Iron rules of tomasi. You repeat part 1 and 2 of my secret seduction course. Now you are ready.

You ask this different girl if she liked to see your dog named ""Bitch"" pronounced Bits. She agrees. Congrats comrade. She's now at your place sitting on your couch.

 Bitch is distracting other bitch while you act like a bitch wondering what to do next.

You remember rule #1 of Tomasi  ""Frame is everything"". You get up out of your chair and proceed to establish frame:

""Bitches of my province, you shall follow my command! Bitch #1 go to your bed. Bitch #2 we shall get down instead.""  

Bitch #2 is surprised that you called her a bitch. She goes on saying she is not a dog you can command. However you know this is a shit test. All is following the script.  You respond to the female sapiens shit test accordingly:

Staring at her left nostril you say; 

""Show me how civilized you are"" then pointing your feet 32 degrees away from her.

She is now soaking wet, you go in for the slay. 

Frame maintained, pussy now slayed.

# Part IV: Waking up

In the morning you then proceed to post a field report on TRP Sub-Reddit. You are then immediately get down-voted and called fake.

You get pissed off.

Just if you have a thing to say, that is not ""nicely"" put in and makes the other person think about their actions, you will get badly shamed by others.  
Gladly we don't have this on this subreddit. I am really grateful for this! I see a lot of amazing people here, who are open to critique and want to grow more.

To my story: There was a trans person asking for advice on another subreddit. I wrote that I don't have an advice, but shaming her parents, just because something did not happened for somebodys own life decisions is just pathetic.

Then I got a backlash from the community. Today I saw that I got permabanned from that subreddit, because of Transphobia.

Just to clear that up, I supported the LBGQT community with my works and have some friends as well.  
But that does not mean that I will just treat some people differently, just because of their belief or other life decisions. 

I don't care if you are white, black, yellow, gay, lesbian, trans, christian, jewish, muslim, atheist - whatever.. I see everybody as a person and if I see you behaving like an asshole, I will tell it to you.

Being brutaly honest does not make you many friends.   
But one thing is clear: being always ""nice"" &amp; ""correct"" won't bring you honest people into your life, who will make you grow.

And I will not shut up by those people, just because I have an opinion. You won't silence me.",4,1

Get Laid a Tonne on Tinder [Part 1] ‚Äì Improving Your Looks &amp; Taking Photos,"Sup guys, I recently completed what I believe is the most comprehensive post on the net, on improving your looks &amp; getting laid on Tinder/Hinge/etc. It's over 130,000 words in total, covering everything from getting your looks together, taking good photos, setting up Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/etc, messaging girls, going out on dates, having sex, and even retaining plates afterwards (retention). It's everything I've learned over the last 4 years of self-improvement, getting laid and working on myself.

It's free (no stupid email signup bullshit), and is written for everyone from complete newbies (including virgins), to veterans looking for an efficient way to get laid on Tinder/Hinge/etc.

Even if you're *not* looking to get laid online, the first part is a standalone guide to self-improvement, particularly **improving your looks**. It covers:

* Hitting the gym
* Losing fat and getting lean
* Improving your fashion/style
* Accessories (watches, rings, etc)
* Hair, facial hair, teeth whitening, tattoos/pearcings, etc
* Skin care
* Height-increasing shoes

&amp;#x200B;

It then goes on to cover every aspect of **taking photos**, including: 

* The vibe your photos should get across
* How to take photos that look natural (not stiff/staged/awkward)
* A huge list of bad photo examples, and a huge list of great photo examples
* DSLRs vs smartphones for taking pics. How to choose and buy a DSLR.
* Shooting your own photos vs paying a photographer
* How to pose
* Editing your photos
* How to get usable feedback on your photos/profile

I debated copy-pasting parts of the guide onto here, or rewriting it as a condensed version here, but the thing is seriously freaking long... like I said, 130,000 words. I don't know any way to share something this long on here as a standalone post. Mods, lemme know if this isn't cool, but I'll just share the link to the full post:

"I just realized every girl that viewed me as a fwb or hook up potential were girls i barely had any inclination to talk to even though they were more attractive and more fun than a lot of girls who ""went for"" off of tinder","this may seem obvious to a lot of you guys but this is an epiphany to me. 


The girls i met at parties irl who saw me as fuck buddies, one night stands, or even bf material, i'd get their numbers or ig and i'd never talk to them aside from if i wanted to randomly meet every other week or month for a party or just plain boring dinner. 


I didnt FEEL like i wanted to send them memes. i didnt feel compelled to say hi to them randomly or anything. It was literally just ""yoo, we're going to x on friday. yall goin? niceee, cya there"" and thatd literally be enough. I could not talk to them for weeks or even months and it wouldnt even register - even though they were objectively hotter than the girls i matched with off tinder.


juxtaposing this to 90% of girls i'd match with on tinder, i felt ""compelled"" in a way to want to talk to them. I felt like i wanted to share with them hilarious memes and crack jokes and get to know about each other and itd go no where.

Even tho the girls i matched with were far less attractive and just simply not as cool, my rejection rate with them was so much higher.

As a man you will live and die alone,"I took a couple years off from posting and came back to find there remains way too many of y'all that think you can take *part* of the red pill and it will all work out.



Sure, lifting, studying, working hard make sense. Invest in yourself and be dominant! Some of you think that will attract some bitches and then you can have your blue pill dream come true. You think you will be loved and safe unlike those other beer bellied losers who don't have their shit together. *They* get divorce raped and disrespected and cheated on because they are losers right?

Not exactly.

Here is where we agree:

One should crush it at school and work. Physique should be top 1%. Weaponize your charisma (game!)

But that trifecta isn't TRP. Not by a long shot.

Men are not lovable. We are useful. Don't even dream the love you feel for women is reciprocated by her, because it isnt. She *can* love her kids that way but not you.

To get what you want and need from women, it's going to be based on admiration and respect. You need to provide emotional stability, vagina tingles, and resources. You have to always be willing to walk. If you waver on any of these, she will lose attraction because women love mercenary and it's men who are the romantics.


This isn't advice to shun LTRs. It's just the way it is and for 50 years no men were told this. 

As a man you are alone when you are single. Same when you have a girlfriend. In fact, you can die in bed an old man surrounded by a picture perfect family and you are still very much alone",136,1
The Importance of Standing Firm.,"**Background:**

If you don‚Äôt know, there are two types of people at the gym. Those that wait and ‚Äúhover‚Äù over you while you pump iron and those who ‚Äúcan I work in with you‚Äù. In my opinion, both are annoying, but I am going to talk about the latter. Now, a couple of things about me. I am 24, 5‚Äô8, around 180 pounds, have been lifting for 3 years, and can lift some good weight and do boxing . As you can imagine, I am not built, but I am toned since I have to be fast on my feet. The gyms in my area barely opened last week and you have an hour to workout(I need at least 1hr and 30) and then you have to leave since they clean and want to limit the number of people inside. 

Anyways, I was hitting chest and was almost done when out of nowhere a fat guy in his 30s, started waving his hand in my face trying to get my attention and proceeds to ask me if he can work in with me. At this point, I was already annoyed by him. I ask him that I had two more sets and that he could wait if wanted to. He reiterates ‚ÄúCan you hear me? Can I work in with you?‚Äù in a more serious tone. I look at him again and tell him the same thing. He then says ‚ÄúYou are not hearing me..‚Äù obviously surprised, I said no and just walks off. 

**Analysis:**

Do you think that guy would ask me the same thing If I was bigger or his size? I don‚Äôt think so. He saw I was ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù than him which caused him to try to establish his dominance it a very subtle way and try to make me accommodate him in my workout. He refused what I told him and continued to press me to answer his question. By repeating his question, he was trying to intimate me. It didn't work.

If I had more than 2 sets I could easily allowed him to work in, but then would I want that? Especially during these times where you have to wipe down your machines, stay 6 feet, etc. Plus, since I only have a 1-hour window to workout, I don think I would want to waste any time, have any distractions, get out of my zone just to let some fat-bad bodied guy work in. It‚Äôs two sets. You could easily come back in 3 minutes and I‚Äôll be done.

Now, I decided to write his because I‚Äôve seen this happen to new lifters a couple of times in the past and has finally happened to me today, where people try to ‚Äúrush‚Äù your workout by asking you ‚Äúhow many sets you have‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan I work in with you‚Äù. Now I am not saying they do it in a bad way, but I personally can‚Äôt work out with others working in with me.

**Conclusion**

Most will say ‚Äúsure‚Äù when asked, ‚Äúcan I work in?‚Äù And that not a bad thing if you truly don‚Äôt mind. But if you actually do care, know that you can say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and that's the whole point of this post. The way I see it, you are ‚Äúrenting‚Äù that space or equipment. It‚Äôs yours until you are done. I feel like my new lifters get intimated by others at the gym and tend to be pushovers(I‚Äôve seen this happened). You have to be firm, confident, and should be comfortable with saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. These are the small things that will help you with your confidence and help you build your character. And remember, your mission is not to please anyone.",16,1

"Relationship Advice Post Analysis: ""I (24M) accidentally overheard my gf (24F) acknowledge that her ex is more physically attractive than me, and it's killing me inside""","As we know, the ~~Relationshit~~ Relationship Advice sub often acts as an unintentional source of Red Pill truth. A few days ago I happened across a particularly interesting thread. What happens when your girlfriend's ex is Chad Thundercock himself? The story and comments from the Blue Pill peanut gallery are quite revealing. Let's walk through the post. Bolded lines have been added by me for emphasis.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I've been dating my girlfriend, ""Liz,"" for almost two years now. We, frankly, have an amazing relationship-- we're compatible in so many ways. **She's my best friend and I can't imagine life without her.**

Right off the bat we can see that this guy is deeply Blue Pill. ""Best friend,"" ""can't imagine life without her."" Remember guys - anytime a girl refers to you as her ""best friend,"" that's a pretty good indicator that you're in her Frame and that she sees you as beneath her.

You are not your girlfriend's ""friend."" You're her lover. But in today's Blue Pill paradigm, we're all equal and there are no authority figures. Everybody is everybody's friend. Parents are friends with their kids. Teachers are friends with their students. Naturally this sets the stage for a volatile and detrimental relationship.

As to ""can't imagine life without her,"" I truly hope that everything works out for this guy in the end, because he's already on the road to putting a noose around his neck if they ever break up.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;She's always buying me little gifts, and **she says I'm the best sex partner she's ever had. Sometimes she'll brag to her friends on zoom about how wonderful she finds me**, and sometimes her friends say they are jealous! In short, she's such a sweet girl with a big heart and we love each other. These past two years have actually been the best ones of my life.

This segment is more interesting for what it *doesn't* say. It doesn't say that she finds him sexy. It doesn't say that she finds him hot and handsome. Being the ""best sex partner"" =/= being the most sexually gratifying.

I've been on both sides. Pre-Red Pill, one of my ""girlfriends"" always told me how sweet, funny, generous, and kind I was. What she *didn't* say was that I was hot or sexy. In several months of being together, she never once let me have sex with her or expressed any interest in doing so. In retrospect, I don't think she was ever sexually aroused by me.

Post-Red Pill, I met a girl for whom I was clearly a physical and sexual ideal. We had sex within 30 minutes of meeting and went on to date for over a year. She constantly told me how hot I was, how I brought out every nasty sexual fantasy in her. She never once said I was nice; instead, she often called me an asshole. And - not to gloss myself - she once said I was ""such an Alpha.""

To be clear for the spergs, there's nothing wrong with being ""nice,"" but if that's all you are, then you're in trouble. Girl #2 once said something like ""you're an asshole, but I know deep down you can be sweet."" You want to aim for Han Solo, the scoundrel with the heart of gold. You need her to believe that *she* brought out the sweetness in you with her feminine charm, it wasn't just given away for free.

&gt;All that mushy stuff aside, here's the issue...  
&gt;  
&gt;Well first, I should add that Liz is way out of my league, physically. **She's like, a real life Instagram model.** My buddies say they are jealous of me. Sometimes strangers hitting on her in public is a bit of an issue, and I can only imagine what her DMs look like... As for me, **I think I'm a 5/10.** Liz says she thinks I'm attractive, and I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but... It's hard not to feel a little insecure when your SO is a total catch and *you* look like a mountain goat.

I will agree with the peanut gallery here and say that OP probably has some self-esteem issues. If this girl really is an HB9 Instagram model, then I highly doubt that OP is really that ugly.

I'd say that OP perhaps *was* a 5/10 during high school and college, gaining several points during his early 20s. But while his body is a 7 or 8, his mind still sees himself as a 5. That's very unfortunate, but it's common. It takes time to internalize your own physical appeal if you weren't always the hawt guy.

That said, assuming this girl really is a point or two above him, the relationship is indeed unstable. Who knows why she got with him. Maybe his family is rich. Perhaps he's an engineer at Apple or something and makes some serious bank. If she really is IG model-level hot, then it's possible that she went through an earlier Epiphany Phase. I often see this with hot girls, who mature much faster than Plain Janes because they spend much of their youth around older men.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Before Liz and I got together, she dated a guy who I'll call Chad.** Now I'm a pretty straight guy when it comes to orientation, but **even i can see that Chad was... physically appealing.** He looked like he came straight out of Bay Watch or something. I saw an old picture of he and Liz embracing on the beach in their swimwear, and honestly they both look stunning.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, other than that I know very little about Chad. Liz never talked about him, other than to say that **they dated for eight months and he was a colossal asshole. That does bring me some comfort.**

Anytime a girl calls an ex an ""asshole,"" that's a Red Flag for possible Alpha Widow. Again, *you* should be that (lovable) asshole in her life.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So, the event--  
&gt;  
&gt;Liz was in a zoom group with her girlfriends, just chatting about stuff. She does that a lot, especially with the quarantine stuff obviously. I was in our room upstairs (we live together in a university apartment) browsing reddit. I felt the need to pee so I silently slipped out of my room and started to make my way downstairs. This brought me within earshot of Liz on her laptop.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was going to just walk down to the bathroom, but I froze on the stairs when I heard my name said by one of Liz's friends on zoom. (Liz virtually never uses headphones.) I didn't hear exactly what was said, but I did hear another friend say ""What about Chad? Does everyone remember him?"" There was a flurry of talking about Chad that I couldn't't quite decipher, but I do know that Liz said ""oh my god you guys"" in a funny/exasperated tone. I did get a flutter of anxiety when I heard his name though. Then someone said in a playful whiny voice ""why'd you get rid of Chad, Liz? He was our eye candy!"" There was some laughing. Then another friend said ""yeah, now we have *OP.* "" It was in a complaining tone, and honestly it hurt. A real punch to the chest, even if they tried to play it off as a joke. At this point, I'd expect Liz to defend me... Which she *kinda* did... By saying ""oh my God, you guys. I know OP isn't eye candy like Chad, but he's an amazing guy. Chad was an ass.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Hearing that was more than a punch in the chest, I felt my whole body just freeze. And a lump immediately formed in my throat. I really wish I could focus on the positive of her saying that I'm amazing, but all I can think about is her saying that Chad was ""eye candy,"" and I'm wasn't.  
&gt;  
&gt;I eventually was able to compose myself and walk down to the bathroom. Liz greeted me and I said hi like nothing happened. But I was shattered inside.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's been a couple of days since I overheard her say the Chad thing. She's been pretty wrapped up with work, so thankfully I haven't had to put on much of a performance. But I've had a lot of time to think... I've turned that moment over and over again in my mind. I know that Liz really loves me... **But the fact is that, no matter how much she cares about me, no matter how compatible we are in other areas, Chad is categorically superior to me in one particular area. Liz finds him objectively more aesthetically pleasing than me. There's no way around it.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**I want to be Liz's best everything. I want to be her best emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and physically. But there's one area I can never be her best. And that just hurts, so bad.**

Now we're reaching the crux of OP's dilemma. On some level, I think all guys want to be told they're sexy, handsome, hot, and so on. They want that *genuine desire.* Something in OP's peripheral awareness is signaling that his girlfriend doesn't have that raw, feral sexual desire for him. Most guys will simply bury those feelings and use Blue Pill logic to rationalize them away. That is, until they're confronted with unignorable evidence to the contrary. For those who haven't, I urge you to read Rollo's ""Saving the Best"" essay.

That's why strippers and cam girls are so appealing. A stripper once explained to me that ""I don't sell sex. I sell fantasy."" It's about *feeling* desired. Guys come in for the illusion and fantasy of experiencing what they never received from their wives and girlfriends. It's actually quite sad.

Now to the comments, which consist of the typical Blue Pill fare. I'll paste a few of the common sentiments. It's appalling to read. Straight gaslighting that completely invalidates this guy's feelings. Naturally we all know that if this story was posted by a girl, the peanut gallery would be clamoring for her to dump him with all the usual ""you deserve better, girl"" nonsense.

&gt;OP is huffing like a child over her not defending him correctly.  
&gt;  
&gt;He‚Äôs being pissy and petty  
&gt;  
&gt;You don't need to talk to your gf about this, you need to talk to a therapist. The problem is 100% you and not her.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dude, with this attitude of yours, you are going to ruin a good relationship with your gf. Stop being an idiot.

Note that OP has done nothing to merit this level of vitriol. He never says a bad word about his girlfriend anywhere in the post. But because it seems like he's verging on a Red Pill moment of clarity, the natural response of the Blue Pill mob is to beat him into submission. Man up, do what you're told, stop being a pussy and get over it. At best, we have the legions of Post-Wall women and Beta males who weigh in with similar stories, assuring OP that everything is okay, go back to sleep, just ignore the man behind the curtain.

This is why the Blue Pill is so fucking confusing. These women probably really do love their husbands, but in a platonic sense...not a raw, feral, lusty sense. There are so many marriages and relationships that *seem* happy. Maybe they even have sex. But now OP will always have this nagging doubt over whether his girlfriend does the same thing in bed for him that she did for Chad.

# Awakening

I waken in the morning seeing the blackness of eyes yet awaken.

Inside I feel the urge to get up however I feel chained in shackles.

I feel the shine of sun touch my skin and the birds begin to chirp. I am still in the dark.

No matter what I see it dose not matter. I stay in shackles.

Shall I get pleasure watching other men be free? No.

The darkness has distorted my vision. For the things they are and have are foreign to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lesson:** The man in the darkness is unknown. To himself and to others. He is blind. The man wasn't in shackles, his muscles were too weak to support himself. However his situation he felt an urge to get up. Will he follow his impulse?

At the start things are tougher to begin. Momentum is what makes things easier. An object in motion stays in motion. Do not stop, only slow down when need be.

# The Man in The Shadows

The night, with the moon giving his share of the sun's light.

However light is needed for those scared of the unknown. The moon is their protector.

I sit on top a building, alone. City makes it noise and it's lights flicker. Dim as the hope they provide.

I am unknown to the world. I own nothing.

I am not apart of society. I have no identity.

Without others I am free to do as I please.

However without weight, sometimes I float away.

I find freedom a gift and a curse.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lesson:** The darkness can be your ally. If your enemy doesn't know you exist it makes dismantling them that much easier. However without weight to keep you grounded you can lose sense of yourself. Freedom can be a curse. Freedom is light, fulfillment is heavy you must chose the weight you carry.

# One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

A man named MacMurphy pretends to be mad in order to get out of prison and is sent to a mental hospital. While there, he opposes the authority of the nurse who controls his ward, and encourages other patients to think for themselves instead of always following orders. But by the end of the novel MacMurphy has had a lobotomy (had part of his brain removed). He is completely unable to think or act for himself and the Nurse once again has control over her patients.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lesson**: The weak have to want change in themselves for it to be everlasting. Secondly, If you do not think for yourself you are still a slave. Others will not always be able to think for you.

# Conclusion

A mans journey is for him to obtain power. ""Masculine mastery"" as it is called. However once a man has true power he shall not need to use it. For it speaks for itself.

"Your Anima, and why you're not Gay.","As a disclosure, psychoanalysis not an exact science and this is just my amateur interpretation. I am not an expert and I have not studied everything there is to know about these things, this is just my experience with it from a 2020 perspective.

If you've watched Jordan Peterson videos you'll probably like this post.

I have been very lucky. I've always had a gift to explore my unconscious through my dreams. Not at first, at first I was just like anyone else, forgetting them every night, but over time through trying to lucid dream I got better at it extremely quickly. After I began lucid dreaming, I realized I could learn much more about myself, and humanity in general, through [interpreting my dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalytic_dream_interpretation). After reading [Freud's book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interpretation_of_Dreams) *(which by the way, is extremely verbose, even translated from German)* I started to look for certain things in my dreams and in other people and realized many patterns society openly mocks and rejects in our current time.

# Dreams

I found the best way to represent the aspects easily found in your dreams are with Freuds model of The Shadow and the Anima, I think Freud calls the Shadow the trickster, but it's harder to grasp what he actually represents from that view. These terms are very easy to understand initially and if you start working with your dreams you will realize these 2 are always in every dream you ever have, this is proven cross culturally, it is an aspect on men. [The Shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology) is the repressed, therefore unknown, aspects of the personality including those often considered to be negative. And [The Anima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_and_animus) is the contrasexual aspect of a man's psyche, his inner personal feminine conceived both as a complex and an archetypal image. There are many other aspects of the psyche that interact with these, but this is all we really need to know in this context.

To make it easy if you actually try to spot them in your dream, the shadow is whatever is telling you that you are not dreaming, or the main character in the play that is being enacted that is not you, and the Anima is the female in your dream. If there are multiple female's, its the most fuckable one, cmon, you know it when you see it. So you're going to say, ""I've had tons of dreams without any women in them"" the Anima was present regardless, either you forgot about the girl or she's represented through something inhuman. She mostly watches and is acted on, the Shadow will drive your attention away from her. 

# The Anima

Since we are men on a discussion board about successfully understanding women, the Anima is critical to this process. The Anima is technically a part of the Shadow, because you repress the outwardly feminine parts of yourself, which makes it harder to access. Think of it like this, it's a little portal into the women world in the very back of the dark parts of your psyche. 

Your Anima will most likely resemble your mom, if your mom was (of course) not related to you, young and very fuckable. The reason for this is that she is the ""ideal femaine"" that gets worshiped and simped for so often these days, and putting her above yourself makes you look weak because it's an extension of saying ""I will never access the woman because I am unable to navigate the darkness, and thus she will always be the most unattainable goal"". This is why putting her a pedestal is cringey. 

I am also lucky in this aspect because I can never identify with my Anima. Many men make the mistake of, through integrating their shadow, confuse the Anima as a part of themselves. I cannot do this because I am motherless. My mom was not in my life after I was around 4 years old. Thus, my Anima is an idealized breedable version of my older sister. 

So do you have to be motherless for this to be easy for you? No, but you need for your family to have operated in your father's frame. And that is the determination of your homosexual potential.

# Trans

How do men who transition to women play into this? Well it's simple, when things aren't working out for you, when society's standards are pressured on you so heavily you have to begin integrating the shadow, you have to start digging through the rejected parts of yourself to try to find what is missing to make you whole. All men do this, it is normal. When Transmen do this, they find the Anima and wholly identify with it. They take that portal to views perspective and hold it to their face and say ""these are my eyes now"". I don't want to be more transphobic than necessary, and I am in no way calling this group of people invalid or undeserving of love. I think they deserve more understanding than anyone due the unique phenomenological behavior. But this explains the massively displays of sexualization from this group, it is another rejected aspect of the self that is being, now, identified with.

# Why being Gay/Trans can break families apart.

It is a rejection of the father's frame. Take the classic example of a nuclear christian family (Mom, Dad, Son, Daughter). Often the masculine father interprets his son's homosexuality as a betrayal, and society currently defines this as *ignorance* or a *phobia* or *hate*. It is not. It would never be taken so personally if were as simple as any of these emotions. The Son is supposed to inherit the father's believes of the world, master them, and build to them after the father passes, and gift them to his sons. This is a rejection of those beliefs and identifying the mother of more importance than the father. ""Yeah Dad acts tough, but Mom runs everything behind the scenes, he's useless without her"" would be a good example of this expression. Compare a Son's coming out to a Mother's affair, they're met with the same level of reactionary disgust, shame and betrayal. 

I do not agree with any of these reactions, but I'm offering my view of why this situation is so overwhelmingly common and is expressed cross-culturally. 

For those of you who think the west is failing and we need to retreat somewhere else, this is around the world right now, it is an extreme problem in the Asian world. A boyish son can easily pedestallize his mother so unhealthily because women are even more a sign of status in an environment like China, where everything is ranked. His father could even enhance this process by being unnecessarily punishing and holding women over the son, ""You'll never get a girlfriend acting like this!"". Just increases the chance of the son setting the femanine as his ideal state. When ""exploring his sexuality"" (as we call it nowadays) he will realize this belief to be true, and take the place of a female in the sexual marketplace his father has stabled into his worldview. On top of that Asian women are remarkably unattracted to men of their own race, their features are considered premature and boyish. I feel for all you Asain TRP dudes out there. But this is my understanding of why countries like Taiwan have such an obvious and overwhelming problem with ladyboys. 

# So do I think this is bad?

No, I think you should disrespect your father's frame. You should throw it away and build your own if his is unfit, you are the son, you hold the future in your hands, you decide what comes with you. And if banging dudes is part of that, by all means smash that ass. I love gay people because I love people, and gay people are usually very loving and open, very transparent, harmless and easy to understand, but every single one from a mother's frame.

Being LGBT+ is more and more common these days, and the *reason* for it from society is ""well theres always been this many gay people, but now we are more accepting and that is a good thing"". I don't believe so. From my understanding, this, along with all the other obvious signs, stems from Fatherhood.


So all this has been true for almost the entirety of human history, besides maybe the collapse of Rome, and now. We understood all of these things so evidently they never need to be explained. This is why being Gay was extremely shameful, and synonymous with an insult to your father until now. We have a counter movement to accept people of all sexuality in order to *undo* the damage that has been done. But in my opinion that really doesn't work. We don't stop trying it, for example in a reddit AMA with a prostitute, you'll see nothing but ""I'm sorry you had to go through this"", ""you are so strong"", ""I can't believe you're so brave"". This is nice, I guess, but it's not solving any problems and its not healing any psychological wounds the woman has endured and continues to suffer from. We have to understand what is going on in order to offer real help and relief. 

# Why does this matter?

You should have an understanding of your Anima so you can navigate the world of the women, as a man, and know what you actually want. You should see how your Anima sees and use that vision to align yourself with the good. If your ideal woman values something, you would gain a great sense of purpose by providing it to the world. I like to see it as a problem to be solved, because my brain is very pragmatic. So theres a problem of young women finding something like 80% of young men unattractive or something, instead of having emotion about it, try to understand that problem and solve it in you actions. It's not enough to understand the language of women with the Red Pill, you have to sell them what they want to buy. 

Think about it like a Mexican man approaching you, shouting in Spanish, begging you on his hands and knees. First you have to learn Spanish, then when you realize he is telling you his family has not eaten in a week, you have to provide him with food. And then you will experience great satisfaction, not through empathizing with the Mexican man's family, but by being proud of yourself for making things better. That is what we do as men, explore the shadow, for the sake of the Anima. We save the princess from the dragon. We. solve. problems.

As a note at the bottom I'd like to say I do not support homophobia or any expression of this perspective in the real world. I do not think this *should* be the way it is, I just think this is how it is. I do not believe a Father *should* be offended by his son being gay, but I think thats the way it is. And if you are in agreement with my understand I would **NOT** voice in outside of an extremely open minded discussion. I've talked to gay people about this who just thought ""wow that makes so much sense"" and then continued their lives as normal. But a less understanding crowd would see this post as ""Hate Facts"" or something and immediate respond with violence so don't be socially inept.",16,1

Why men are feminists and why feminine men are far likelier to be homosexuals,"**Why are men feminists**

-
It's because men think women operate like men. It's because men think women operate ""logically"", like men. ""If I'm thinking like this, she is probably thinking like this too."" 

How do you feel when a girl (or someone) treats you nice, as a man? It does feel good, right? 

Or to be more specific, when someone (a girl) is on your side and supporting you, you feel good, and you feel better about that person. There are some girls out there who noticed this and treat the guy in the nicest way possible and mirror him in every conceivable way, and when the man is emotionally invested they show their true faces. 


Men are logical, so they use logic to put two and two together and come to the conclusion that ""if they treat women nice, they'll be attracted"" 


They wouldn't be way off if they knew about how it was in nature, and what both genders did to survive. 



So, men become feminists just because to get pussy, or validation by more people

**Why feminine men are far likelier to be homosexuals**


-
An idea is that a feminine man will be ostracized by other men in a social circle because of his feminine features, he will be called ""sissy, faggot"" whatever you imagine, he will be bullied. He will be an outcast. This will make him polarize himself as a separate individual and take on the attraction similar to of girls.  That's the basic explanation, a more detailed explanation would be about that man trying to emulate a mother to a man. 

It works the other way around as well, homosexuals are going to spend more time with females and pick up on feminine traits, although there are masculine homosexuals too. 

And, what are outcast people like? Broken, sad. Emotionally unstable. 

They're easier to control.",14,1

Feminism isn't completely bad for TRP men,"Is feminism completely bad?
-

Bad for who? 

Women: Yes. 

Horny women who have dreams about being gangbanged: No. 

Men: Yes. 

Masculine men: No and this is where it gets interesting. 

Think of a society where a lot of the women are brainwashed feminists who don't hate men, and where a certain percent of the men are masculine men. Feminist girls will have no problem when it comes to worrying about being called a ""slut"" by the society because it's a free society where women can do everything they want with the amount of freedom Feminism gave them. So, girls will be comfortable about premarital sex and sex without commitment and all women will pick a masculine men as a sexual partner. 

And masculine men will even be more valuable because of how scarce they are. It's all about demand-supply. 

If you haven't noticed, the society I wanted you to think is identical to our current society. 

Hypergamy in TRP men's cases is not a bug, it's a feature. It's a feature we as TRP men can work around and abuse it to our own will. We can have sex with far more girls who doesn't have expectations of commitment, marriage. That only happens when a society is feminist.




Then why does TRP actively and openly oppose feminism? 
-


The problem is, with feminism all the gender roles are getting inverted and the whole thing is getting off balance. Females are taking up on masculine traits, males are taking up on feminine traits. And it's mostly the negative traits of both gender, it creates a conflict. Suffering becomes inevitable for your average Joe and plain Jane. Although, your average Bob suffers much more than Jane, because women despise a man who needs to be told to become dominant. Women don't want a woman for a partner, they want a man. And when their partner is feminized, they make them go through hell. This is why pretty much most of the bluepilled guys out there who are looking for a true love in their lives are suffering from heartbreak. 


TRP thinks long-term, and opposes feminism because it fucks up the balance and polarity in gender roles. TRP thinks for all of the society, not only for masculine men.",50,1

Pareto's Other Theory,"
As the United States slides into chaos, while the statues go *crack*, the money printers go *brrr* and TRP goes *boop*, there is only one person on this Earth who you can trust to give you the Red Pill on the situation. You can't trust the universities, the media or the president. Your friends and family don't know what's going on or why. There is only one person that you can rely upon to have your back and his name is Gaylubeoil.


Who warned you of the impending lockdown back in January? Gaylubeoil. Who gave you the heads up on easy protest pussy long before things turned violent? Gaylubeoil. As the world tumbles into upside-down clown world, Court Jester Gaylubeoil holds the keys of truth [stolen from people with the small hats.](https://thejewishvoice.com/2020/05/gates-foundations-event-201-rockefeller-foundations-lock-step-simulations-eerily-resemble-current-events/)


While everyone here knows Wilfried Pareto's 80 20 rule. Few of you were taught his much more controversial Elite Theory. Here's how it works. Society can be broken down into four groups‚Äîthe M*asses*, Elites, Anti-Elites, and the Counter-Elites.


The majority of people are as the name suggests: Masses. The Masses aka Normies lack agency and react to the world in a simple, predictable, instinctual way like a sheep. Wherever the media barks at them to go they go. Think of your goofy beer dad who rages at the black athletes kneeling during sportsball. He doesn't understand the politics behind what's happening and needs Tyrone to stop kneeling and dribble! Beer-Dad is only good for two things. Participating in Wage Cage Mortgage Middle Class Leased BMW Tax Farm and voting for a pre-approved candidate every four years. 


The Elites, are those who hold power and have the will to use it. They set the music and write the script for the performance the masses must dance in. This group is comprised of the  extremely wealthy, the Deep State, and those in political office at a high level‚ÄîSenators, Congressmen, etc. 


The Anti-Elites are those who rebel against the status quo but have no desire for an alternative. They don't like what's happening and if circumstances were completely reversed they still wouldn't. This group includes BLM, Antifa and that one kid in the back of class who could never stop yelling.


The final and most dangerous group are the Counter-Elites. These are the SpicyBois with the means and the will to overthrow a present order and establish an alternative. Lenin, Fidel, Mustache Man, Moses and our prophet Mohammed peace be upon him, fit the bill.


In the [Good Old Days](https://youtu.be/tcQgJj-4TZY), Universities were places of learning, partying, and easy sex. Their purpose was to create a highly skilled technical class of engineers and programmers and a managerial class to rule over them. Life was easy because jobs were plentiful. Then [Financialization happened](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/NYUGDPFinancialShare.jpg). The Elites realized that [funny money stock market games](https://youtu.be/dgcofJneJWM), were much more profitable then jocking the middle class for their surplus value. In other words the Elites realized they didn't need a middle class to make money anymore, which is to say they didn't need a middle class. If they didn't need a middle class then they certainly didn't need a university system who's function it was to create a middle class.


2013 was the beginning of the cultural revolution known as The Great Awokening characterized by Affluent White Female Liberals aka AWFLs shifting to the left of black women on social issues. The Elite tricked the AWFLs into believing middle class white men were the Elite and should be harrassed endlessly. Occupy Wallstreet stopped thinking about Wallstreet and instead focused on trannies and BLM. This took the heat off the real Elite and gave them room to play their Financialization games in peace. In short universities went from graduating capable middle class workers to producing debt slaves, Anti Elite blue haired diversity specialists and false rape accusations. The effect of all of this on the sexual marketplace is obvious to everyone but the autists of askTRP.


As the contradictions of the system intensify in 2020 the ire of the Anti Elite must be kept firmly on the Masses and not on the Elite who created the situation. Tearing down Confederate monuments, renaming military bases, making police LGBT+ friendly, and ending ‚Äúsystematic racism‚Äù are all symbolic gestures which maintain the status quo, make people feel important but ultimately change nothing. These protests are fully supported by the political establishment, the Deep State, Silicon Valley, and Tranny Corporatism. Just as the Jeffrey Epstein Netflix documentary was meant to give people closure without disclosing his involvement with an intelligence service that rhymes with the word *applaud*, these BLM protests fulfill a similar need: these are the pre-approved anti-elite protests explicitly created so that nothing will change and everything will remain the same.


This brings me to my final point. Something like the Red Pill can not be allowed to exist. Billions of dollars are spent to construct the media smokescreen that I just pulled you out of in a few humerus paragraphs. You really think Reddit is going to allow me and my team to use a bunch of under-sexed nerd virgins as child as soldiers in a culture war they can't understand like it's 2015? No. RedditCorp needs to purge this site of wrongthink long before bumbling Biden steps on stage and anyone says anything about it. If Reddit wants DNC checks, it has timetables, targets, and expectations to meet. The way forward is through forming a secret group of men who can help to redirect the political energy and flow of history toward its own ends.  We have to learn how to avoid the censors as if we were living in the 1930s Soviet Union. The future has been canceled, and any direct conflict against the system is going to fail. We have to move beyond our current situation and accelerate capital to its breaking point.

"Wife demands Open Marriage or else divorce. Husband accepts for the kids. Wife starts sleeping with a guy lined up immediately. Husband finds someone to sleep with. Wife becomes furious, demands Closed Marriage.","tl;dr: title

https://archive.fo/lqal2

This doesn't need much analysis. We've seen this in many times before. 

Interesting points:

* Husband was dealt a tough pair of cards. A certain divorce, which he didn't want (they had kids). You could argue it was beta to accept the demand. I think it was alpha to do what he felt was best for his kids and start sleeping with another woman. 

* Wife described her husbands 'affair' as 'cheating' even though opening up the marriage was her demand.

* Wife had someone in mind when she made this demand for an open relationship. They always do. They do not bring up this subject (which has risk) if they are not pretty much ready to go with a guy in 24 hours. Branch swinging requires another branch. 

* Wife's affair partner really was an affair, her partner had a wife who didn't know. But husband did it by the book with a single woman. Stand up guy.

* Wife then threatens divorce if husband doesn't *close the relationship*. When someone has used the nuclear bargaining chip of divroce once, expect them to use it again. The cat is out of the bag.

* Husband offered a fair legal arrangement that if he closes the relationship then there are consequences if the wife or husband commits infidelity again. Wife goes beserk. Refuses to sign it. I believe that this shows the lesson the wife learned was that she should have cheated in secret, not asked for an open marraige. She wanted to sleep with other men, and didn't want her husband to sleep with other women. And the easiest way to achieve that was to close the relationship and just cheat. 

* The wife said the husband had to end his relationship with Amber because the wife knew her. Well it turns out that the wife knows her because she used a tracking device, then drove to Amber and introduced herself. Lmao.

Mia Khalifa Wants Her Videos Removed,"So [Mia Khalifa has started a petition to get her pornhub videos removed](https://www.change.org/p/pornhub-justice-for-mia-khalifa) and it has garnered 1.1 million signatures. 

This is the same girl whose entire claim to fame was being a pornstar, the reason she has a following, a career ANYTHING is because of those videos. 

Its such a parallel of how girls will go through a massive slut phase in college or in their 20s but the moment they want to settle down they want that phase ERASED. IT DOESN'T COUNT!!! 

They want to enjoy having endless pleasurable sex with multiple guys and then preserve their image as an innocent pure virgin. They want to eat their cake and have it to. 

[Mia Khalifa has previously cursed out interview hosts who have asked about her pornstar career.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ef7pAZtBKo) On the Lance Armstrong podcast she talks about how much she regrets doing porn and was ""taken advantage of"" for doing it and being paid so little. But she was paid market rate... And chose to do it... Along with additional videos after the fact... It literally the equivalent of a retroactively withdrawing consent.  

Also its not like she has a new life and career. Her current brand is not that distant from her pornstar image, her patreon is softcore porn shoots and she constantly sells calendars and photoshoots in lingerie. 

And best of all there are 1.1 million white knights ready to assure that version of reality and support her. There is no personal responsibility if you are a women. There are enough horny blue pill guys that think that trying to erase a girls history will give them a chance with her. We're in the simp generation.",377,1
The Details Don‚Äôt Matter,"
For those of you out there agonizing over the insane amounts of the new information you have learned from the wellspring of Red Pill knowledge, posting in askTRP about a specific girl you want to put your penis inside (be it an ex, or a ‚Äúplate‚Äù or a girl you haven‚Äôt even touched yet); the details don‚Äôt matter, there is one rule to follow....

**Polarize the situation and force her to action**

If you feel like a girl is attempting to use you for your attention and good feelz without any desire for a sexual interaction,  this one simple move will answer all of your questions and should inform all of your decisions moving forward with that particular woman.

It‚Äôs so easy. 

No more long nights spent debating whether it‚Äôs was a shit test, or a comfort test, or beta bait, or who is in who‚Äôs frame. 

No need to tell internet strangers your recounting of the details of the interaction to see if someone can tell you if you still have a chance with one specific girl.

Don‚Äôt want to be a beta orbiter? Don‚Äôt want to be an emotional tampon? Don‚Äôt want to be a girl‚Äôs gay best friend? 

Want to lay some pipe or move on?

**Just polarize the situation and force her into action**

Women communicate covertly, through actions not words. 

The medium is the message.

Pay attention to what they do, not what they say. 

No man of value wants to waste endless amounts of precious time on some girl who has no intention of ever putting out.

But how do you know?

Here‚Äôs a little story from a long time ago:

I have an ex that I haven‚Äôt seen in over 10 years. We were off and on for years as the power dynamic shifted back and forth. She had oneitis, I had oneitis, we were kids learning life the hard way. 

She is now married with two kids. 

She has continued to contact me periodically over the years in somewhat the same manner as when we were together, then broken up (as she rode the CC and kept me on the back burner as her ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù who she ‚Äúwill always love‚Äù).

As I became Red Pilled 4 years ago, I stopped responding to her once in a blue moon pings, because who the fuck wants to dig through the trash? The hard next/ghosting is so much better. 

Over the past year her 11pm messages of ‚Äúhi‚Äù then ‚Äúhi how are you?‚Äù then ‚Äúhey how‚Äôs it going?‚Äù, ‚Äúhey‚Äù etc. had steadily increased to a level of at least once per week. 

Did she not realize I was never going to respond? What is she going for here?

As the late night frequency was increasing, I grew annoyed and curious and I had the thought (as most men would) that maybe she was looking for some extramarital dick. 

Or at least was open to a good fucking. 

Either way I was ready for the pinging to stop (kids this is why you block your exes everywhere). 

So I engaged her and had a quick back and forth to test the waters. 

Disclaimer: I am currently in an LTR with a sweet girl who I enjoy fucking. I am also gaming other girls and will fuck other girls if and when my needs aren‚Äôt being met. I‚Äôm also kind of sadistic and was toying around with the concept of polarization as she was relentlessly reaching out almost out of nowhere. 

**New women are always better.**

That being said...

She told me she was in our home town visiting her mom while the kids stayed home with their dad. 

Interesting...

A perfect opportunity to fool around without the husband in the picture. Was she hinting at sex? Is she just contacting me out of boredom and looking to waste my time?

I live out of town but the potential for crossing paths over the holidays is there, and as I was already growing tired of talking to someone I‚Äôm not currently fucking, I decided to go ahead and polarize the situation to see what‚Äôs what. 

‚ÄúNice, we should get together one night next time we‚Äôre both in town.‚Äù

For those of you who don‚Äôt understand covert communication, I said ‚ÄúIt was nice talking to you, don‚Äôt bother hitting me up anymore unless you want to fuck‚Äù

She went cold.

She knew exactly what I said, and there are no signs of life. 

It‚Äôs been months without a word.

What was once her endlessly texting me ‚ÄúHey how are you?‚Äù at midnight every few days to a week and me not responding, turned into her not even responding to a ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù offer to hang out. 

Boom. Answer achieved. Peace restored. Any further interaction without her leading with a place and time to meet up would be an utter waste of time and will be ignored.

No need to debate the details. No need to spend time keeping the thread going with her in hopes of banging one out. 

Just more free time to spend pursuing other naughty adventures with new and exciting females.

If she wants to fuck she will act. If she doesn‚Äôt she won‚Äôt. 

Faint heart never fucked fair lady. Fortune favors the bold. 

The fortune you seek is the best ROI and bang for your buck. Good sex for a minor investment is solid. 

Not wasting valuable time is a fortune much greater. 

This post is long, but I achieved my mission in about 15 minutes of spaced out texting. 

No analysis necessary for decision making or action. 

No askTRP post about this one special girl. 

No more annoying pings. 

PLUS the potential for a no effort incoming Christmas booty call. 

Life is good. Life is easy.

Polarize and walk away.",65,1

Why jealousy makes no sense - A story,"Hi boys,

If you suffer from jealousy, this story might help you out. There's nothing in it you don't know already if you've been here for a while but for some reason, it has opened the eyes of everyone I told it to. I've never been a jealous guy myself and it was clear for me why, but this experience cemented that conviction for life in me too.

There's a TL:DR at the bottom if you're not up for a long story at the moment.

\----

So, seven years ago I got hired in a multinational. One thousand people worked at the building at the time, this company is serious and we got a 3 month in-class training with full salary payment. There were two groups, mine was for the technical area, and the other was for a more basic callcenter one.

In my group there was this guy who was from the country side, had this confident smirk about him, he had been a firefighter but got out because seeing dead people fucked him up, he was about 6 feet tall and had decent looks but there were no muscles in him, he was 26 years old, he was in a LTR for about 5 years by then and he was quite dumb, he struggled hard with the classes and he was not the guy to have a philosophical talk with. Let's call him John.

In the other class there was this particular girl, she was near 5 feet tall, she was blonde with the hair long down to her butt and she was blue eyed, she had Brazilian genes from her mom and despite her caucasian features she had one of the most amazing asses I've ever seen! She was small of frame and thin but had a beautiful face and she had these gigantic ass cheeks. As she was 23 years old that thing was perky despite its size and she knew it drew all the looks around, even if big butts are not your thing you couldn't help but notice that thing, I caught women looking at her regularly, mostly with an envious look. There were female clothing guidelines in place so no tight clothing could be used and no mini skirts and so on, but she would do shit like wearing loose white pants which were quite translucent under sunlight, no matter how loose the pants were, her ass was tight against the fabric out of sheer size, she would wear a black or red thong underneath some days and OH JEZUZ, that was distracting to say the least. Let's call her Jane. She was living with her fiance at the moment and had been with him for some years. They were getting married the next year.

So on with the story. John Dumbfuck over here liked to talk to me. I've always been a magnet for the cast outs and only when I was 25 did I learn to show them the disinterest I really had so they would fuck off, but I was stuck with this guy for the moment because I was 23 and non the wiser. He told me he had been cheating on her girlfriend like there was some kind of prize for it. Why did he do it? Had he not fucked enough before getting into a LTR? No sir, he had fucked his whole hometown dry. It was because when he was 11 years old a cousin told him ""you gotta cheat on them before they cheat on you"". This motherfucker took that advice to heart as if it was a quote from Gandhi or some shit and proceeded to cheat on every girl he had since then as much as he could.

Of course, after we got out of the class and onto the job, he just started shooting every where, there were indeed many beautiful women around and he couldn't help himself. I told him that ""you don't shit where you eat"", but his dick disagreed.

Now Jane Hoe over there was one of his targets. He slithered his way into this girl's social circle (I gotta give it to him, he was good at that) and ended up going out a couple of times with the group.

One day he approaches me all nervous. I'm trying hard to have a standard small and short chat with him but he is trying hard to get me to ask him what the hell is going on, so eventually I do just to see if he would get the hell away after it.

This is what he has to say - He's been fucking Jane lately. He was glistening, he just had to tell somebody, you know? Because why keep that life destroying secret... secret? The world needs to know.

Here's how they did it:  Jane Hoe got his daddy's car for a couple of months, so she's coming and going to and from work in it instead of taking the bus. He had been flirting with her strongly since the second night out with the group, she had already started messaging some openly sexual stuff to him and so on. When he knew she had the car he just went for it.

When you work in a callcenter, if you leave at 8 PM, should you get an incoming call at 7:59 PM, you must pick it up anyway, that might take just 5 minutes to solve or an hour or more, depending on your luck. It's not unusual for this to happen.

So what did they both do? They told their couples that they got a call right before leaving and that they would be arriving late that day. They then promptly got into her daddy's car and fucked off into the sunset.

They would fuck for 30 to 45 mins in the car and then she would drop him off somewhere safe and drive home to her fiance, the guy that lived with her and she was marrying next year. She would arrive freshly fucked and kiss that guy in the mouth and lie her way through the day.

John was so proud of himself when he was telling me this, like a child doing his first successful mischief. He was going home to his 5 year LTR girlfriend that (guess what boys!) was now pregnant because Dumbfuck doesn't know how to pull out apparently. His girl wanted to abort the pregnancy but he would not have it because of his traditional upbringing, so she had the kid and he kept on cheating on her all through pregnancy and after the kid was born, of course, a fantastic dude, I tell ya.

So what's the point of all this long winded story you wrote, dude? You might be asking.

The point is that **a woman will find a way. If she wants stranger dick, she will have stranger dick.** I know you know this already but hey, this is for you the jealous types.

It doesn't matter how jealous you are, how much control you exert over a woman, how much do you ask needy retarded things like ""call me when you get out and then again when you get off the bus"" (like some other hottie in the company, she told me his boyfriend asked her to do so, she cheated on him too while in the night shift, the dude that got her worked in my same area and told me \[dudes just can't shut the hell up, can they?\]), how much you check her social media or if you demand access to her phone or ask her who's she's going out with and any other insecure jealousy shit like that.

I**f a woman wants to cheat on ya, she will! So chill the fuck out.**

Most people are as dull as a rock but when it comes to fucking, they find a way. They turn into Fucksteins, as I call them.

So hey, if you're a jealous guy please remember, no pressure you put into your girl will make her NOT cheat on you, it's actually worse. The less you give a fuck, as long as you're fucking her good and often and owning your shit, the more probable it is she will not cheat. Also, jealousy feels like shit! I felt it for real just once when I was 15 and I said to myself ""FUCK THAT, I never want to feel that again"". I can't imagine feeling that stuff every single time your girl is not around.

So if you feel that emotion going up, you take a deep breath, remember the lessons of TRP, remember this story and remember that you might be one of the very few lucky bastards that got a girl for life, but if not then remember, **she's not yours, it's just your turn.** Don't dwell on it, it's the way of life. There's a lot of fuckboys like the dude in this story too, I just wanted to punch his face in man, when I knew his girl was with child and he was still chasing women all around the office he was sorely needing some teeth adjustments.

So don't be a fuckboy if you're in a LTR and don't be a jealous asshole. You can be a better man.

Learn the basics here, do your best and if you find your girl has gone sideways, move on and better luck next time sir, but don't let that fuck with you, just move on, the planet will keep spinning with or without you.

**TL:DR -** Dude I worked with had a 5 year old LTR, girl in the company lived with her fiance, they found a way to cheat and fuck anyway within very tight schedules. Women will cheat if they want to and you cannot avoid it, no matter what you do or how much of a jealous prick you are.",5,1
Girlfriend of 3.5 years cheated on me.,"My girlfriend of 3.5 years cheated on me. I‚Äôve never felf this way in my entire life. Please help.

We‚Äôre both 21, in college. She‚Äôs studying in our home country, whilst I left to study abroad. You see where this is going.

Yesterday I found a strange message on her phone. When confronted about it, she seemed really dismissive and annoyed and she kept saying she doesn‚Äôt remember, until she suddenly said she only kissed the guy once. Obviously that hurt, but that was not all. After 3.5 years of relantionship you kind of start to really know the other person. I felt she wasn‚Äôt telling me the whole story. Lo and behold, after 3 hours of constantly asking her if there‚Äôs something else she wants to tell me, she breaks down in tears and tells me she also fucked him once; she kept repeatimg how regretful she‚Äôs been this whole time (oh, btw, it‚Äôs been 6 months since the cheating happened :) ) and how she didn‚Äôt like it; how she only did it because a friend of her told her that she should take advantage of her college time and ‚Äòrack up some experience‚Äô.

I cannot get the images out of my head. I cannot understand why the fuck she did this. I cannot understand how she broke my trust so easily. I cannot understand why. I just cannot process this. I‚Äôm empty inside, whilst feeling the saddest and loneliest I have ever felt in my life. 

I think I need therapy, I feel like I cannot get past this without it. The images man, the images in my head ... make it stop please...

Sorry if this comes of as not so manly, I know you guys are a little bit older and have been through a little bit more in life. I just trusted this girl with my whole fucking heart. Please show me the way forward, I‚Äôm just not capable of seeing it. Please help.",43,1
