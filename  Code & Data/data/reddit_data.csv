I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Edit: Holy shit, I did not expect this kind of response! I posted this right before going to bed, thinking that maybe five people would see it at most. Thanks you so much for your kind words, it makes me feel better that there's other people who understand what I'm feeling!",0

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed.

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Being homophobic is anti-men,"As a bi man, I feel like there's lots of anti-LGBT talk in men's rights circles. This is mainly because being effeminate or anti-masculine seems like it's being forced to act womanly, but in fact it's the opposite.

Not letting men act how they want because it's not manly enough or isn't the 'right' kind of masculinity is forcing men to act a certain way. Truly supporting men's rights is letting them act how they want.",0

I am thinking we need red pill ish men's clubs.,"Kind of like fight club but with less fighting and violence. The world is crazy and men are the problem. That's what's being screamed from teh rooftops out there. It seems like a men's club for guys with the red pill mind set would offer a place to let your guard down. Also it would allow frank open conversation with other men. 

Its just a thought right now but I think it could be a real helpful thing for men who feel like they are alone against it all.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes. I got to the shoe aisle, and noticed immediately that there was a designated ladies‚Äô shoes section, a designated kids shoes section... and that was it. There‚Äôs literally no men‚Äôs shoes section. Slightly annoyed at this, I figured they were probably just hidden against the back wall on the opposite side of the kids section from the ladies shoes. And they were. Kind of. There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second. Why on earth is there a section of women‚Äôs boots smack dab in the middle? It‚Äôs on the exact other side of the shoe section from the ladies shoes. The heck is this? How painful are they going to make shoe shopping? I just want one decent pair of shoes. And the guys selection is so narrow that if it‚Äôs not freakin cowboy style steel toed boots, it‚Äôs classy dress shoes that you would like wear to a wedding. The heck happened to all the sneakers? Oh wait there‚Äôs one brand of sneakers with maybe three sizes available, even though the shelves are clearly fully stocked. 

It‚Äôs just so frustrating. Okay rant over now.",0

I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all.

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed. There is zero compassion or empathy towards men, especially when it comes to the male body. People seem incapable of realising we are essentially all human beings with the same feelings and that our bodies are made from the same parts. I truly despair and it depresses me deeply.",0

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence)

Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice.

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes. I got to the shoe aisle, and noticed immediately that there was a designated ladies‚Äô shoes section, a designated kids shoes section... and that was it. There‚Äôs literally no men‚Äôs shoes section. Slightly annoyed at this, I figured they were probably just hidden against the back wall on the opposite side of the kids section from the ladies shoes. And they were. Kind of. There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second. Why on earth is there a section of women‚Äôs boots smack dab in the middle? It‚Äôs on the exact other side of the shoe section from the ladies shoes. The heck is this? How painful are they going to make shoe shopping? I just want one decent pair of shoes. And the guys selection is so narrow that if it‚Äôs not freakin cowboy style steel toed boots, it‚Äôs classy dress shoes that you would like wear to a wedding. The heck happened to all the sneakers? Oh wait there‚Äôs one brand of sneakers with maybe three sizes available, even though the shelves are clearly fully stocked.

One trip through social media is all you need.,"Honestly, scroll through anything and you'll see women treated like some holy and precious thing. They're fawned over, pandered and worshipped. 

Their success are because they are women any failures because men exist. 

Living life as an good looking woman is easy mode. 

And I don't even mind this but they have accept this as some kind of strength. Or a 'privilege.'",0
Is this the tone of voice we need?,,0
I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Edit: Holy shit, I did not expect this kind of response! I posted this right before going to bed, thinking that maybe five people would see it at most. Thanks you so much for your kind words, it makes me feel better that there's other people who understand what I'm feeling!",0

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence)

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Edit: Holy shit, I did not expect this kind of response! I posted this right before going to bed, thinking that maybe five people would see it at most. Thanks you so much for your kind words, it makes me feel better that there's other people who understand what I'm feeling!",0

That's what's being screamed from teh rooftops out there. It seems like a men's club for guys with the red pill mind set would offer a place to let your guard down. Also it would allow frank open conversation with other men.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes. I got to the shoe aisle, and noticed immediately that there was a designated ladies‚Äô shoes section, a designated kids shoes section... and that was it. There‚Äôs literally no men‚Äôs shoes section. Slightly annoyed at this, I figured they were probably just hidden against the back wall on the opposite side of the kids section from the ladies shoes. And they were. Kind of. There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second. Why on earth is there a section of women‚Äôs boots smack dab in the middle? It‚Äôs on the exact other side of the shoe section from the ladies shoes. The heck is this? How painful are they going to make shoe shopping? I just want one decent pair of shoes. And the guys selection is so narrow that if it‚Äôs not freakin cowboy style steel toed boots, it‚Äôs classy dress shoes that you would like wear to a wedding. The heck happened to all the sneakers?

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes.

I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all.

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed. There is zero compassion or empathy towards men, especially when it comes to the male body. People seem incapable of realising we are essentially all human beings with the same feelings and that our bodies are made from the same parts. I truly despair and it depresses me deeply.",0

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed.

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

The 7 Worst Things About Being Male,,0
One trip through social media is all you need.,"Honestly, scroll through anything and you'll see women treated like some holy and precious thing. They're fawned over, pandered and worshipped. 

Their success are because they are women any failures because men exist. 

Living life as an good looking woman is easy mode. 

And I don't even mind this but they have accept this as some kind of strength. Or a 'privilege.'",0
Is this the tone of voice we need?,,0
I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Edit: Holy shit, I did not expect this kind of response! I posted this right before going to bed, thinking that maybe five people would see it at most. Thanks you so much for your kind words, it makes me feel better that there's other people who understand what I'm feeling!",0

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink.

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed.

That's what's being screamed from teh rooftops out there. It seems like a men's club for guys with the red pill mind set would offer a place to let your guard down. Also it would allow frank open conversation with other men.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes. I got to the shoe aisle, and noticed immediately that there was a designated ladies‚Äô shoes section, a designated kids shoes section... and that was it. There‚Äôs literally no men‚Äôs shoes section. Slightly annoyed at this, I figured they were probably just hidden against the back wall on the opposite side of the kids section from the ladies shoes. And they were. Kind of. There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second. Why on earth is there a section of women‚Äôs boots smack dab in the middle? It‚Äôs on the exact other side of the shoe section from the ladies shoes. The heck is this? How painful are they going to make shoe shopping? I just want one decent pair of shoes. And the guys selection is so narrow that if it‚Äôs not freakin cowboy style steel toed boots, it‚Äôs classy dress shoes that you would like wear to a wedding. The heck happened to all the sneakers?

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes.

There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second.

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed. There is zero compassion or empathy towards men, especially when it comes to the male body. People seem incapable of realising we are essentially all human beings with the same feelings and that our bodies are made from the same parts. I truly despair and it depresses me deeply.",0

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed.

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

One trip through social media is all you need.,"Honestly, scroll through anything and you'll see women treated like some holy and precious thing. They're fawned over, pandered and worshipped. 

Their success are because they are women any failures because men exist. 

Living life as an good looking woman is easy mode. 

And I don't even mind this but they have accept this as some kind of strength. Or a 'privilege.'",0
Is this the tone of voice we need?,,0
I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Edit: Holy shit, I did not expect this kind of response! I posted this right before going to bed, thinking that maybe five people would see it at most. Thanks you so much for your kind words, it makes me feel better that there's other people who understand what I'm feeling!",0

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink.

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed.

That's what's being screamed from teh rooftops out there. It seems like a men's club for guys with the red pill mind set would offer a place to let your guard down. Also it would allow frank open conversation with other men.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes. I got to the shoe aisle, and noticed immediately that there was a designated ladies‚Äô shoes section, a designated kids shoes section... and that was it. There‚Äôs literally no men‚Äôs shoes section. Slightly annoyed at this, I figured they were probably just hidden against the back wall on the opposite side of the kids section from the ladies shoes. And they were. Kind of. There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second. Why on earth is there a section of women‚Äôs boots smack dab in the middle? It‚Äôs on the exact other side of the shoe section from the ladies shoes. The heck is this? How painful are they going to make shoe shopping? I just want one decent pair of shoes. And the guys selection is so narrow that if it‚Äôs not freakin cowboy style steel toed boots, it‚Äôs classy dress shoes that you would like wear to a wedding. The heck happened to all the sneakers?

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes.

There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second.

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed. There is zero compassion or empathy towards men, especially when it comes to the male body. People seem incapable of realising we are essentially all human beings with the same feelings and that our bodies are made from the same parts. I truly despair and it depresses me deeply.",0

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed.

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

One trip through social media is all you need.,"Honestly, scroll through anything and you'll see women treated like some holy and precious thing. They're fawned over, pandered and worshipped. 

Their success are because they are women any failures because men exist. 

Living life as an good looking woman is easy mode. 

And I don't even mind this but they have accept this as some kind of strength. Or a 'privilege.'",0
Is this the tone of voice we need?,,0
I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Edit: Holy shit, I did not expect this kind of response! I posted this right before going to bed, thinking that maybe five people would see it at most. Thanks you so much for your kind words, it makes me feel better that there's other people who understand what I'm feeling!",0

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink.

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed.

That's what's being screamed from teh rooftops out there. It seems like a men's club for guys with the red pill mind set would offer a place to let your guard down. Also it would allow frank open conversation with other men.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes. I got to the shoe aisle, and noticed immediately that there was a designated ladies‚Äô shoes section, a designated kids shoes section... and that was it. There‚Äôs literally no men‚Äôs shoes section. Slightly annoyed at this, I figured they were probably just hidden against the back wall on the opposite side of the kids section from the ladies shoes. And they were. Kind of. There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second. Why on earth is there a section of women‚Äôs boots smack dab in the middle? It‚Äôs on the exact other side of the shoe section from the ladies shoes. The heck is this? How painful are they going to make shoe shopping? I just want one decent pair of shoes. And the guys selection is so narrow that if it‚Äôs not freakin cowboy style steel toed boots, it‚Äôs classy dress shoes that you would like wear to a wedding. The heck happened to all the sneakers?

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes.

There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second.

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed. There is zero compassion or empathy towards men, especially when it comes to the male body. People seem incapable of realising we are essentially all human beings with the same feelings and that our bodies are made from the same parts. I truly despair and it depresses me deeply.",0

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed.

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

One trip through social media is all you need.,"Honestly, scroll through anything and you'll see women treated like some holy and precious thing. They're fawned over, pandered and worshipped. 

Their success are because they are women any failures because men exist. 

Living life as an good looking woman is easy mode. 

And I don't even mind this but they have accept this as some kind of strength. Or a 'privilege.'",0
Is this the tone of voice we need?,,0
I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Edit: Holy shit, I did not expect this kind of response! I posted this right before going to bed, thinking that maybe five people would see it at most. Thanks you so much for your kind words, it makes me feel better that there's other people who understand what I'm feeling!",0

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink.

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed.

That's what's being screamed from teh rooftops out there. It seems like a men's club for guys with the red pill mind set would offer a place to let your guard down. Also it would allow frank open conversation with other men.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes. I got to the shoe aisle, and noticed immediately that there was a designated ladies‚Äô shoes section, a designated kids shoes section... and that was it. There‚Äôs literally no men‚Äôs shoes section. Slightly annoyed at this, I figured they were probably just hidden against the back wall on the opposite side of the kids section from the ladies shoes. And they were. Kind of. There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second. Why on earth is there a section of women‚Äôs boots smack dab in the middle? It‚Äôs on the exact other side of the shoe section from the ladies shoes. The heck is this? How painful are they going to make shoe shopping? I just want one decent pair of shoes. And the guys selection is so narrow that if it‚Äôs not freakin cowboy style steel toed boots, it‚Äôs classy dress shoes that you would like wear to a wedding. The heck happened to all the sneakers?

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes.

There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second.

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed. There is zero compassion or empathy towards men, especially when it comes to the male body. People seem incapable of realising we are essentially all human beings with the same feelings and that our bodies are made from the same parts. I truly despair and it depresses me deeply.",0

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed.

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

One trip through social media is all you need.,"Honestly, scroll through anything and you'll see women treated like some holy and precious thing. They're fawned over, pandered and worshipped. 

Their success are because they are women any failures because men exist. 

Living life as an good looking woman is easy mode. 

And I don't even mind this but they have accept this as some kind of strength. Or a 'privilege.'",0
Is this the tone of voice we need?,,0
I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Edit: Holy shit, I did not expect this kind of response! I posted this right before going to bed, thinking that maybe five people would see it at most. Thanks you so much for your kind words, it makes me feel better that there's other people who understand what I'm feeling!",0

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink.

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed.

That's what's being screamed from teh rooftops out there. It seems like a men's club for guys with the red pill mind set would offer a place to let your guard down. Also it would allow frank open conversation with other men.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes. I got to the shoe aisle, and noticed immediately that there was a designated ladies‚Äô shoes section, a designated kids shoes section... and that was it. There‚Äôs literally no men‚Äôs shoes section. Slightly annoyed at this, I figured they were probably just hidden against the back wall on the opposite side of the kids section from the ladies shoes. And they were. Kind of. There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second. Why on earth is there a section of women‚Äôs boots smack dab in the middle? It‚Äôs on the exact other side of the shoe section from the ladies shoes. The heck is this? How painful are they going to make shoe shopping? I just want one decent pair of shoes. And the guys selection is so narrow that if it‚Äôs not freakin cowboy style steel toed boots, it‚Äôs classy dress shoes that you would like wear to a wedding. The heck happened to all the sneakers?

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes.

There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second.

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed. There is zero compassion or empathy towards men, especially when it comes to the male body. People seem incapable of realising we are essentially all human beings with the same feelings and that our bodies are made from the same parts. I truly despair and it depresses me deeply.",0

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed.

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

One trip through social media is all you need.,"Honestly, scroll through anything and you'll see women treated like some holy and precious thing. They're fawned over, pandered and worshipped. 

Their success are because they are women any failures because men exist. 

Living life as an good looking woman is easy mode. 

And I don't even mind this but they have accept this as some kind of strength. Or a 'privilege.'",0
Is this the tone of voice we need?,,0
I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Edit: Holy shit, I did not expect this kind of response! I posted this right before going to bed, thinking that maybe five people would see it at most. Thanks you so much for your kind words, it makes me feel better that there's other people who understand what I'm feeling!",0

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink.

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed.

That's what's being screamed from teh rooftops out there. It seems like a men's club for guys with the red pill mind set would offer a place to let your guard down. Also it would allow frank open conversation with other men.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes. I got to the shoe aisle, and noticed immediately that there was a designated ladies‚Äô shoes section, a designated kids shoes section... and that was it. There‚Äôs literally no men‚Äôs shoes section. Slightly annoyed at this, I figured they were probably just hidden against the back wall on the opposite side of the kids section from the ladies shoes. And they were. Kind of. There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second. Why on earth is there a section of women‚Äôs boots smack dab in the middle? It‚Äôs on the exact other side of the shoe section from the ladies shoes. The heck is this? How painful are they going to make shoe shopping? I just want one decent pair of shoes. And the guys selection is so narrow that if it‚Äôs not freakin cowboy style steel toed boots, it‚Äôs classy dress shoes that you would like wear to a wedding. The heck happened to all the sneakers?

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes.

There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second.

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed. There is zero compassion or empathy towards men, especially when it comes to the male body. People seem incapable of realising we are essentially all human beings with the same feelings and that our bodies are made from the same parts. I truly despair and it depresses me deeply.",0

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed.

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

One trip through social media is all you need.,"Honestly, scroll through anything and you'll see women treated like some holy and precious thing. They're fawned over, pandered and worshipped. 

Their success are because they are women any failures because men exist. 

Living life as an good looking woman is easy mode. 

And I don't even mind this but they have accept this as some kind of strength. Or a 'privilege.'",0
Is this the tone of voice we need?,,0
I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Edit: Holy shit, I did not expect this kind of response! I posted this right before going to bed, thinking that maybe five people would see it at most. Thanks you so much for your kind words, it makes me feel better that there's other people who understand what I'm feeling!",0

One trip through social media is all you need.,"Honestly, scroll through anything and you'll see women treated like some holy and precious thing. They're fawned over, pandered and worshipped.

I'm tired of being the target of revenge for things I didn't do.,"Sorry for making you guys listen to my rant, but I'm feeling rather angry right now.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

Edit: Holy shit, I did not expect this kind of response! I posted this right before going to bed, thinking that maybe five people would see it at most. Thanks you so much for your kind words, it makes me feel better that there's other people who understand what I'm feeling!",0

(Most) Gay men are on your side,"I'm a 29 year old guy. Been openly gay since I was 12. When I say gay, I don't mean a stereotypical  obnoxious, narcissistic attention seeker at ""pride"" (shame). I mean I am just a regular guy who happens to be into guys. If you passed me in the street, you would just think me any normal bloke and if you remain a regular associate of mine it's highly likely a few years before the penny drops and you realise I'm gay.

I want all of you to know that all men (and women in fact, but this is not about them) share the burden of the current social climate. I hate being lumped in with the ""gay community"" because to me it's gone so loopy and so far aligned with feminist/gender ideology that to be associated with it is an embarrassment. Please understand there are countless other gay men just like me who are the silent majority. We aren't all insufferable narcissists trying to join the coven.

I've been in a stable relationship with my partner for 5 years now and we really do have the most wonderful, equal and loving relationship. Both of us are so aghast at the current state of ""liberal"" politics to the point we've resolved to eventually getting a place in the country and becoming self-sufficient so we can watch the world burn from afar.

Just want this to be clear - gay men are men too - and we see and experience the same bullshit and bigotry as you even though we don't necessarily experience parental alienation etc as much. We are all men and we are on the same side!",0

I'll leave you to pick out all the horrendous and unforgivable lines and images written by this vile author and magazine. It truly sickens and saddens me to the core that these things happen to people and instinctually you know that a large number of people will be laughing as they read this imaging what happened to those men. How can we ever have equality and move towards a loving caring world when we clearly have such despicable, sociopathic, unempathetical, evil members of society and when such unbelievably terrible things are reported in such comical and nonchalant ways. Needless to say there are innumerable different articles and sources that report these uncountable events in the same way. These are just 3 that popped up from the same author in a 10 second search. I have seen terrible things. Most probably have but they probably laugh it at and think no more. I can't bring myself to go searching for them all but feel free to add any down below if you come across them.

Imagine if this were the other way around. The scary thing is that even if people read it and agree it is unfair and made from double standards they deep down probably wouldn't feel the injustice. They'd probably still find it amusing on the inside and not have the reactions they would if this were extreme violence against women.  That is unfortunately how everyone has been brainwashed. There is zero compassion or empathy towards men, especially when it comes to the male body. People seem incapable of realising we are essentially all human beings with the same feelings and that our bodies are made from the same parts. I truly despair and it depresses me deeply.",0

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in HER particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. Edit: it didn‚Äôt break thank god

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes.

"Ask Feminists Rules, FAQs, and Resources",,1
Do you have a problem with women who want to be attractive or value her appearance highly?,"(I know the title sounds accusatory/demeaning but trust me that's not the intention)

I notice within feminist circles whenever a woman expresses feeling discontent about her looks &amp; wants to be attractive, she gets told ""pretty is not the rent you pay to exist as a woman"" and I frankly think it's unhelpful. There are also women who put more value into their appearance than their accomplishments etc, or enjoy being complimented on their looks more than their personality and achievements, and these women get told the same thing that they shouldn't value their appearance so highly. That they're just playing into what patriarchy wants, and therefore they should stop doing that.

Like it's true that women need not to value their appearance highly, but does that translate to women *must not* do so? I find that the opposite of liberating women, if that's what the intended message is.

During my late teens I used to find myself unattractive, and I worked very hard on my appearance to become content with my looks years later. And I was so lucky that when I told my peers about my problem, they gave me actual advice on how to improve my appearance rather than ""no, that's what the patriarchy wants, pretty is not the price you pay to exist as a woman, you should be ok being unattractive..."" etc. Like what would i possibly do with this information?

What if it's your female friend or relative or daughter who told you that she wants to be more attractive? Would you tell her ""no, that's what patriarchy wants, so you should not want that"" or would you support her wishes and give her advice on improving her looks?",1

Does using pedophilia as a catchall term downplay its severity or not?,"So I was talking with a housemate of mine and he said in Germany, when they deal with pedophiles, they rehabilate them by treating them and recognizing it as a mental illness. I then asked what he meant by using the term pedophilia because I said for example, people would call 21 and 17 pedophilia. He said while that is predatory, he would not call it that and meant attraction to really little kids. So it kinda had me wondering, does using pedophilia as a catchall term take away from the severity and discussion/treatment of the issue",1

He said that the pressure on men to be providers and to be stoic and emotionless is more of a burden than the consequences of femininity.

What do feminists think of negotiating with the Taliban?,"I ask this question at a trying time in the global context of the war on terror and the war in afghanistan. It is clear that only negotiation and peace process will end the killing and stop the bloodshed from flowing in the fields and on the streets. But whatever happens, the Taliban will remain a force in Afghan politics and will have a big say in how the future country is run. Of course, this war was sold as a war for women, to liberate them from the Taliban and the patriarchal Islamic man. Now, feminists find that their war goals have not been achieved. The Taliban are nowhere near defeat, the US/Afghan governments are no longer capable of defeating them in battle and the Islamic movement is as strong as it ever was. At this point, what do feminists think of negotiating with the Taliban? Because this means that feminists will have no choice but to make compromises and they are not in a position to make any demands. The Taliban hold all the cards in this area and popular support is decidedly against feminism, even among many women. The Afghan government is however willing to make compromises. So are feminists ok with compromising things like sexual freedom, reproductive rights, education etc. in order to stop the bloodshed and end a war that has killed and displaced millions?",1
"Are songs like ""Throat Baby"" misogynistic?","So I wasn't raised ""right"" in any sense of the word, so we'll get that out of the way.

My first exposure to feminism came from reading blogs like Jezebel and XO Jane in the early 2010s. And I've always been confused about hip hop and misogyny. To me it seems like stuff like country music or rock and roll could take a lot of crap for misogyny, but then I'd hear some sexually explicit lyrics that don't actually treat women that well in hip hop and it just never seemed to get the mainstream hate that other genres did. But I'll grant that it's entirely possible that just because I listen to so much more hip hop, and the only times I've ever read about country or rock and roll were when they were in the media, that maybe I just didn't get the full picture. I know that people have gone off to hip hop for misogyny, but I don't know it just doesn't seem like it's that frequent of topic.

So the ""Throat Baby"" comes out, and we'll here are the lyrics:

https://genius.com/Brs-kash-throat-baby-go-baby-lyrics

And I don't know what to think about this. On one hand a lot of people just look at a song like this and think it's a sexually charged song and that makes it okay because talking about sex is okay. I can see the argument that this is just like WAP was where they're just celebrating sexuality, in particular a good blowjob. On the other hand, this just feels like a song that doesn't treat women well? I mean the opening lyrics are calling a woman a bitch and a hoe, and it's an ode her ability to perform sexually for him. 

And I don't know if I'm reading this right. I don't know what really to make of these lyrics. 

So is the song misogynistic?",1

"Do you believe that conventionally attractive women, on the sole basis of being attractive, are discriminated against for being attractive?","So I know that pretty privilege is a thing in many areas. I think this is especially because men may be kinder to them in specific situations, they aren‚Äôt expected to commit crimes, get better treatment when out shopping, and that sort of thing.

But something I also hear is that ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù is often used too often, as a way to discredit attractive people when they come forward about being harassed, sexually or not, and that people have less empathy for them.

Part of this could be a hyper awareness of the ‚Äúhalo effect,‚Äù in which intensifies the jealousy or idea that pretty women don‚Äôt have any real problems.

Personally I think that women that are conventionally very attractive face a double edged sword where they receive privilege they don‚Äôt necessarily want, but people tend to underestimate them in other areas of their lives based on the idea that women can‚Äôt be multi dimensional. 

They also may receive more unwanted sexual attention, and have that dismissed when they come forward, say at work or school, because it should be expected because they are so attractive.

I don‚Äôt know how to word this better so I‚Äôm hoping that somebody will chime that has more complete ideas on this topic",1
"Going out of your way to ""avoid being assaulted""","As a young woman who has mostly lived in small towns, I (fortunately) have very little experience with catcalling, harrassment and other creepy, dangerous behaviours that women can come across when in the public space. However I know that it is unfortunately very much an issue and that in many countries (including mine), women have to constantly think twice before going out alone after dark or wearing revealing clothes in the street. I'm curious as to what strategies some of you who live in big cities have had to put in place in order to avoid that. Did you set up a code with your friends to check on each other? Do you carry mace around or any other object to defend yourself just in case? To make things clear, I know this situation is purely the product of a patriarchal society and that it is happening because boys are not being taught respect and consent. None of this is women's fault, no matter what we are wearing, where we are going or what time of the day it is.",1

She was really mad and then she asked me that she is not really interested to be a housekeeper and she would like to have a career. I told her that her career would not be forever in her life because she is playing a big trade-off in her life with career and having kids. I dont think it is toxic masculinity at all. I believe that a man has to be the provider and protector for her woman and the woman has to be the foundation of the family by making kids.",1

How to deal with pua or other sexist groups as a strong and mature woman?,"I'm not sure if this is the correct sub to make this post, so I'm sorr if it's not this one.

English is also not my first language, I just wanted to make it clear.

I don't like to expose myself a lot on the internet, so here's what you can know about me: I'm a girl in my late teens, I have no interest yet in getting into a relationship. So this post is not about dating advise.

I recently discovered the pua and involuntary celibacy wold, groups that basically blame women for not wanting to be involved with them

I never felt so disgusted and discredited with humanity when I saw the materials post and idolized there.

How can a human being look at this and find it normal? Basically, the introdution of the book by one of the main ""God"" of this group, described that his greatest desire was to arrest all woman and watch them go hungry and begging.

Fortunately in the country where I live, this movement is little known, but even so I fear that this virus will spread here.

So, I would like to ask you, mature and more experienced woman. How do you handle the tactics of the pua?

Online harassment is easy to deal with. Ignore, report and block. But what about when you have an ""alpha"" in front of you?

How do you shut up its negs and other tactics?

Have you had any experience?

It is better to ask for when I have this bad luck, at least I am already armed and already know how to deal with them with class.",1
"Is a ""simp"" just the male version of a ""pick me""? And is it a net good for feminists?","I read a thread from a while back on here about simps and had a few comments say that it's good for the men to be raising women up even if he was only doing so because they were women and he was attracted to them and ultimately it was bringing women up. (Ends justify the means I guess). But wouldn't it be problematic for a man to put women as a sex on a pedestal? That's not equality. I'm aware of the existence of people who will use simp for anything including just showing women basic respect and decency. 

But when I refer to simps (on the rare occasion I even use the word) I'm referring to the type of men who believe women can do no wrong, who in any conflict between a man &amp; women will not only always side with the woman but will follow whatever logic allows him to paint her in a positive light even if simply flipping the genders would immediately get him to change his perspective. The kind of guy who sells out his self-respect for a little approval or validation and thinks little of both himself and other men simply for being men. As though we are the lesser brutes who should feel so lucky as to have a woman grace us with her presence.  The kind of guy who gets cheated on for years by his wife for months and then he begs for her forgiveness because he's not man enough and just wants her back. I can go on but I feel the point is adequately made. 

In that same post I saw someone making a comment to the effect of ""if a guy wants to pay a woman for her being on onlyfans good because shes providing a service and she should be compensated for it"". Which I agree with. But there is also a part of me that thinks ""yeah, but I can't help but wonder would this same man pay for said service if he was regularly having sex and had genuine connections with women in his life rather than transactional ones?"" I picture a lonely man who imagines a relationship with a woman who'd never spit in his direction if he wasn't paying her for it and who never will feel a connection towards him. And how he'd probably be happier if he spent his time and effort bettering himself, gaining confidence, working on his attractiveness, and putting himself out there to find someone who loves him, wants him, respects him, etc. 

Furthermore, because he's ONLY defending or concerning himself with women because they're women, he isnt really seeing them as people is he? The double standard reeks of hypocrisy when you just know  that his concern quickly drops if the situation were about another guy. I'm referring to guys like this and not someone whose just being considerate, defending a friend or being decent. I'm referring to the dude who will hold a door open for a full minute because a pretty girl is walking in that direction but would let it slam in the face of someone he isn't interested in standing right behind him. I know it feels good to have people be so considerate. But it just seems unhealthy at a certain point. And like it could lead to some bad outcomes. At the end of the day though, he is improving the lives of women around him, bringing them up and defending them. So is it a noble and ultimately good thing?

I might be in the wrong sub for this. In fact I almost certainly am(maybe shoulda asked menslib). But I've felt a lot more comfortable asking questions here now than before as a good deal of people here are damn decent and reasonable. And I am very interested on a feminist perspective on the importance of men's sense of self respect and value both AS men and as human beings worthy of dignity, boundaries, and compassion. It isnt the greatest concern in the face of issues women deal with XD but this is ask feminists and I did want to ask. Does such a thing even hold a candle to women's progression and success in society? If a man or a large group of men are eagerly putting themselves down to bring women up SPECIFICALLY because they value women more than men is it simply their choice to do so and a net positive because it's bringing women up?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Say that a group of men are doing whatever it takes for the validation, approval, and acceptance of women including devaluing and putting themselves and other men down/treating them unfavorably. Would it be considered a net positive if it brings women up?

Of course noone objected to Ruby Rose being a lesbian during S1 but that is another talk. However I saw a comment by a woman saying how this is natural to happen (the show flopping) because women do not watch superhero (I do not know how to write this in a gender neutral way in English) movies/series because they do not relate to the protagonists and the genre. And that is why they make ""female"" tv series with many women e.g Gossip Girls, because it has many women and it is ""easy"" to watch (because yes Aquaman is super complicated to watch jeez) .

Help understanding intersectionality between feminism and the modern trans movement,"(Very quick background: I was raised by a second wave feminist mother (and a father who makes an effort but is very much a product of his time) but went through most of my childhood in a very conservative area of the country so there weren't many other feminist influences in my life besides my mother until college.)

I am having a lot of trouble reconciling my understanding of myself and my own feminism and what I know about trans rights.  I would like an informed explanation as if I had been in a coma for 25 years.  I'm just six months shy of leaving the 25-34 year old age bracket if that matters.

I've read some things that are apparently said by 'TERF's, if I understand the classification right?  Some of it seems logical but some of it seems like bigoted bullshit.  I feel like I'm missing some critical information, but most internet searches have lead me to information that seems all in or all out and nothing in between.

Side note: I don't get the problem of the who uses what bathroom thing at all; if some creeper is going to spy on women in the women's room they're going to do it whether trans people are allowed in one bathroom or the other.  They're not worried about rules.  Weirdest logic ever.  Let people use whichever bathroom makes them feel the most comfortable and let it go, right?   
 I'm not a fan of having gender segregated bathrooms at all, tbh.",1
Is it sexist or racist to say I'd never let a white girl cut my hair?,"there was a 'viral' video a while ago on twitter n IG of a white woman in my area (Dallas Tx) barber cutting hair in a black barbershop.

I reposted it on my IG story and said I'd personally never let a white girl cut my hair. I received lots of DMs from white girls thinking I'm prejudiced, racist or sexist. Personally, I wouldnt mind a black woman cutting my hair. In fact, as long as they black, they good in my book.  I've gotten a few haircuts from white dudes. But I'd never get a cut from a white woman. Especially one who has long hair, wears excessive  makeup, and doesnt look like the type who'd cut hair. People have no issues when others say they prefer tattoo artists who are inked up themselves. But the same doesnt apply here?

Does this make me racist or sexist? I'm black btw",1

How to introduce your conservative family to feminism,"I don‚Äôt know how to perfectly articulate what I‚Äôm trying to ask.

Is there REALLY a place for men in feminism?,"If I'm being honest, this question is better suited for a radical feminist. However, the Ask_Radical_Feminists sub is gone, and there's no other group about this...so I'm asking it here. Also, please excuse my english, it's not my first language.

Is there really a place for us in feminism? Can we really be accepted and work as an ally when ALL of us are raised to view women as just commodities for our own gain? If I'm being honest, I don't think we can, collectively at least. I think we're honestly too deep down the rabbit hole.

I've been in a road of deconstruction for the past year, trying to shed every misogynistic idea that was ingrained in my upbringing. Recognizing how women are exploited since birth, how they are denied basic control of their bodies, how they are relentlessly sexualized their entire lives, how POC women (especially black women) are time and time again completely vilified, ignored, abused, and massacred across the world, among countless other issues.

I did so, but I realized there are misogynistic traits in ne that will likely never go away, by virtue of being a man. I realized how there are things I'll never be able to truly let go, because of conditioning or plain ego on my part (as pathetic as that may sound). This made me think how the average man is so blind and so drowned in ignorance and sexist ideals...
I really wonder if there's an opportunity for us to genuinely be allies.

Sorry if this was too longwinded or redundant, and forgive me if I expressed ignorant/stupid ideas here, all I want to do is learn.",1

What isn't modern history telling us?,"For history I started taking a history class, of course, it's always jarring to hear about what's been happening through history. However, the topic that I wanted to bring up was just how late it was when women got certain rights in the United States. Yes, I'm fully aware that in other countries there are still very basic rights that aren't granted to others. And reading would be interesting on the topic further as well.

For this theory, I'd like to talk about certain things that a lot of people might find jarring or incredulous about the rights women had throughout the years. The thing that really spurred this for me was learning that women couldn't apply for a credit card without their husband's approval until 1974. If anyone would like to do more reading on that the subject was changed by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

Further reading spurred that there was no Equality Act added to the amendment. Protecting people on all levels of law. This might not seem important for some but it's definitely something that is extremely important.

Issues with co-opting spiritual movements women participate in,"This is inspired by a side conversation in another thread, but a thing I have noticed in spiritual movements I am familiar with - for me personally that‚Äôs Christianity and paganism - is how quickly women‚Äôs spirituality gets co-opted for commercial gain.  Whether it‚Äôs the Christian women‚Äôs retreats that are bigger on clothing sales and diet plans than they are theology or Salem being a ‚Äòfunky‚Äô bachelorette party destination and witchcraft as aesthetic.

All too quickly, it seems like any group where women show up, there‚Äôs this impulse for someone to jump in and try to shift it from the initial intention - women connecting to discuss and work on spiritual/theological matters - and to shift it back to more ‚Äòacceptable‚Äô behavior where women focus on things like relationships and appearance.  

Wondering what other feminists are noticing about how women‚Äôs role in spiritual (or anti-spiritual, as the case may be for women in atheism, who certainly face a fair bit of sexism and erasure) communities, gets co-opted and limited, and how you approach it and what your general thoughts are around how this plays out in communities you know.",1
How to explain the gender gap in nutrition in developing countries?,"OurWorldInData has [a series of plots](https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment) on hunger and undernourishment in the world.

There is only one chart that shows a breakdown by gender. It's about the percentage of children under 5 who are stunted (meaning, more than 2 s.d. below the WHO standard of height-for-age, reflecting poor nutrition).

[https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-stunting-male-vs-female](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-stunting-male-vs-female)

As you can see, in virtually all the documented countries, the rate of stunting is higher for boys under 5 than for girls under 5. The gap is not huge, but it is very consistent across different countries and cultures.  In particular, I find it strange that the observed gender gap is the same in cultures as different as, say, Peru and Zimbabwe.

Do you know what processes could possibly be at the origin of this gap? Is there any feminist scholarship analyzing malnutrition in the developing world?",1

Is it misogynistic to think men are treated just as badly as women.,Title says it all.,1
Is misandry justified if it will never be as big of a problem as misogyny or racism?,"Asking from a ""man""'s perspective not that it really matters:

Now there's prejudice against every individual. Does prejudice against a man simply because he's a man stem from patriarchal problems making ""misandry"" not really a thing?

Some point that out in a very hateful way. You know the usual KAM stuff etc... Ofc hate could be justified as I understand and emphasize with women's issues and the ""8000 years of oppression"". It just seems a bit counterproductive. I don't think it Is it a good way to promote feminism like this, combating hate with hate and I think it makes men turn away from feminism and engage in a hateful circle jerk themselves.

"How can we encourage people who say ""the world doesn't work that way"" to build a world that works that way?","Sometimes when promoting ideas like feminism, I've come up against folks who say things like ""People just naturally form hierarchies"" or ""One person looking for power over another is just the way the world is."" A common antifeminist anxiety that shows up on this subreddit is the idea that feminists want to ""flip"" patriarchy to create a matriarchy, as if this is the only way humans can operate, with one group dominating and oppressing another.

Granted, many people make this comment in bad faith. Often people with this attitude are just saying ""I don't *want* the world to work this way."" I don't really care about convincing these people. But I do think there are cases where people *want* a better world, but don't trust others not to take advantage of an equal situation to oppress others or genuinely feel that most of humanity is fundamentally selfish.

What was your pre-feminism - nah I think genderstereotypes are stupid - moment as a child/teen?,"Hi, so I had a discussion with a friend the other day about traditional genderroles while growing up and how we only understood the idea of feminism in our late teens. At one point she shared the story about how her teachers back in school would always ask the boys to carry stuff like chairs and tables and whenever the girls wanted to help they were like. ""No that's not for girls."" Which ultimately ended in her going anyway and trying to carry twice as much as the boys did.

Funny thing is... I did exactly the same. Just as, I guess, a lot of other girls. 
And we were joking that all the girls who carried chairs in school are now feminists.

The White feminists of the first wave were criticized for being racist, but would you say that are not feminists too? Everyone still calls them feminist.

I definitely feel such folk exist, and before I became a feminist and sex positive, my own moral judgements against premarital sex/lust were directed towards men and women alike.  My understanding is that religions and their texts especially that characterize sex as sinful, lust as a vice, etc irrespective of gender.  It just so happens that religious and secular societies tend to condemn women more than men, and that systematic violence punishes women more.  It also seems to mostly be secular societies that actively praise men for having a lot of sex.

Why should women have more maternity leave?,"Title says it all.

Edit: No it doesn't I was not clear. I am speaking strictly of non-medical maternal leave and in comparison to non-medical paternity leave.

But as many of you mentioned, feminism wants both. 

Many have said the media portrays maternity leave as a priority but they are not feminists, and what they mean is parental leave in general.

If a woman needs to recover no problem, that is medical maternity leave.

As far as taking care of a child, I think it should fall on the father if they wish to do so as well.

Uneven Maternity leave and no paternity leave (non medical) not only damages men who want to be with their children but women who are assumed to be primary care takers of their child. 

My point is not to say women don't need the recovery time, they do, this is why I clarified with non-medical maternity leave.",1

Is transphobia rooted in misogyny?,"I've been transitioning for a little over a year now and of course, I've run into plenty of transphobes online.

How do I (19 year old man) support feminism without accidentally perpetuating the patriarchy.,"I‚Äôm not really sure how to word this question, but pretty much as the title suggests: how can I, as a man, advocate for women‚Äôs rights/be a male feminist? On the one hand, I‚Äôm concerned that if I speak too much, I‚Äôll come across as disingenuous, just doing lip service to feminism in order to get ‚Äúcredit‚Äù so I seem like a good dude (I‚Äôm sure we all know the type of person I‚Äôm talking about, but if not, look up the ‚Äúgirl-at-a-bar‚Äù women‚Äôs March SNL skit). Or alternatively, I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôd overshadow women‚Äôs own voices, like as in I‚Äôd ‚Äúmansplane‚Äù or white knight. I ultimately have not had the same societal experiences as women, so it‚Äôs not my place to speak on their behalf/explain their experiences with a social injustice (that again I haven‚Äôt experienced). So I would assume I should keep quiet. But then on the other hand, I‚Äôm concerned if I speak too little, I contribute to the patriarchal system because by staying silent I‚Äôm complicit in injustice.

My general philosophy, with really any social injustice, is to let those who have endured it speak to their own experiences, and I just help propagate that message; in other words, I let them lead the charge. But where exactly does the line between the two areas I laid out above lay? As women, in what ways can I be most useful towards achieving gender equality? 

Also, I hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as disingenuous. I sincerely am curious, but I wasn‚Äôt really sure how to ask the question without coming across as kind of a arrogant or like a white knight",1

I‚Äôm fully aware that both men and women in the military can be subject to those crimes, but it affects women in the military more.

Are rape revenge films pro or anti feminist? Or just neither?,"Content warning: Discussions of sexual/physical violence.

I was wondering what some of the feminist perspectives of films like I Spit on Your Grave are, considering that sexual violence against a woman is at the core of that story. I always figured that it was probably one of the most anti-feminist films possible, consider its a series of exploration films wherein the main draw is sexual violence. And the movie shows everything in very graphic detail, and for a very long screen time. So right off of the bat showing something like that for titillation strikes me as a very  un-feminist thing to do.

But on the other hand I was thinking that I don't think anyone could walk away from it thinking that the movie is either in favor of such behavior, or that the victim is shown as responsible for what happened to her. And whatever your thoughts of graphic, violent retribution are, the movie really seems to relish in seeing the rapists being brutalized. And the films show the victim/avenger as getting away with it (well, legally anyway), so if the movie has any message it would be 'People who sexually assault should be tortured to death, and those who brutalize them should not be punished for it.'

That doesn't sound like feminist message, but it also doesn't seem like its pro-rape culture either. And if feminism is ultimately about fairness, brutalizing men who brutalize women is fair in a way.",1

My question is this: what do I say to a female who believes that ‚ÄúThere should never be a female (American) president because females are much more emotional than males, it is a male job, and a woman could start a war in an instant based on whether or not she is menstruating‚Äù This was not stated quite as delicately, but that is the gist of her argument. I am also a female, and completely disagree with her sentiments.

I did tell her that ‚ÄúJust because she doesn‚Äôt think she would be a good president doesn‚Äôt mean she should bar that opportunity for an entire half of the population just because ‚Äòwomen have emotions‚Äô‚Äù

We may not always feel the same about everything (then again, nobody ever does!), but every person on earth has feelings. It does not matter your gender, sex, status, skin color, heritage, dna.... we all have feelings! A person that doesn‚Äôt could be called a sociopath, and are not fit to be president in my eyes BECAUSE they don‚Äôt have empathy! 

Back to the question- what do I say to this person?! She is incredibly frustrating. As a side note, I have to work in close proximity to her, and she has other gems of opinions such as ‚ÄúThe Capitol riot was a false flag attempt at a coup‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe scriptures say that vaccine companies are going to wipe out 3/4 of the population‚Äù and ‚ÄúA mask is a burka‚Äù. I can‚Äôt say anything too rude or too biting, but I really need something with to come back at her with.
Thank you, fellow feminists!

Why is sexual objectification linked to revealing clothes?,"Whenever I see a discussion about sexual objectification, people always talk about the revealing clothes. Isn't covering women's body to ""protect"" them from men's attraction also a sexual objectification?

How should a man feel about periods/pms/pmt etc?,"I've just read a thread on a facebook group I'm part of, about women in the group's period experiences. Here are some of the responses -

"" I always start beef with my partner. I get super anxious and jealous when I‚Äòm on my period""

"" I once got mad at my boyfriend that he bought a bag of candy that was 7 euros. I stood in the middle of the crowded city Square screaming at him that I was so mad at him about it.""

"" There was that time when we were cuddling on the bed, he was looking at his phone, and all of a sudden I yelled ""don't ignore me!!!"" And I started bawling. Just... Out of nowhere. Thankfully my boyfriend knows that it wasn't anything personal, it was just stupid hormones""

"" Last week I yelled at my husband because he used the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù utensil to stir his coffee  Then cried.""

(there are 50+ more stories in this vein)

To be honest, reading these have made me feel genuinely stressed and worried about having a relationship. Do I just have accept that women are childish, unstable and mildly abusive at this time? How much shitty behaviour should someone put up with from a partner that has periods before you call it emotional abuse?

I have some mental issues in my family members (both male and female), I have some trauma myself, and I'm really not good with people being unstable and fragile, even if it's just temporarily. I'm not really good at being ""strong for them"". And to be honest I'd have a hard time staying calm and compassionate with the behaviour quoted above.

And then I realized this happens in real life too. I mean having a preference of genders to make friends is alright, like if you want to have more male friends because thats easy for you, thats alright (like I m pan and prefer women which makes me really nervous around them so its hard for me to be friends with them) but the reason for that be ""too much drama and stuff and are way too much to handle"" and then pass it off as a joke, is that alright?

[Male] [Question/Insight] Unemployment Insurance based on the medieval wage system in the US.,"I'll preface with reaffirming to myself and audience that I am aware that I would not know, what it is, that I do not know. That I could not attest to any opinion which would properly reflect the world beyond myself.

As most of us have come to be made more familiar with the mechanics of the Unemployment Insurance(UI) system in the USA, we can see that there is a crude eligibility screening for applicants. Determination of eligibility for a scaling amount of weekly benefit compensation, weighs itself upon the reported earnings from previous time periods. Thus, having not 'earned enough money' or a taxable work history can mean the DOL deems you not worthy to receive assistance, or very little of it.

Especially in a time where many have become burdened with lack of income, fair compensation and fair health environments during an economic shutdown and a pandemic assistance is critical. I would strongly argue that this system is massively a failure to women and a spit in their faces, when they have contributed so much. Many women take on burdening work roles which are not arbitrary taxable work history. Many women still live under the societal, peer, and familial pressures to be home-makers or work reduced hours for that role. Pregnancy can offset a reflective work history which UI is based off of. Obvious patterns of preference for males in many industries also hinders female record-able work history. 

Now American women, statistically receive less UI, if at all. I cannot know this and have peace. To have an assistance system which deems those who did not serve their lives to income verifiable by some agency. This does not represent me, and I feel it does not represent many others. How thankless are we to our sisters, mothers, daughters, aunts, neighbors, girlfriends, babymommas, wives and countless other shoulders of women that we (males) share our burdens and duties with. This is nothing short of abandoning women because of their situations that can largely be attested to a historically male dominated 'employment' system. These are official decisions which say 'you aren't significant enough' to give even meager assistance to them in a viral pandemic and economic shutdown. Women who have endured just as much, if not more, as men. Women who have given just as much, if not more, than men. Women who ARE our humanity just as much, if not more than, men.

And yet, they wait to recieve word of a paltry assistance which they have earned a thousand times over. Only to be told their history is not known of what they have done. Their history is deemed not enough based on how many dollars they had recorded for earning within this system. Their contributions, work, past year, sufferings, and value beyond recorded dollar transactions.. were not to be met with even the meakest of human dignities in assisting to merely survive. No. They would see you be abandoned, in this arena of fabricated inequality.

I don't know where to start. Somehow we have to change this assistance system.",1

Do boys benefit from having a sibling of the opposite sex while girls are disadvantaged ? how can we change this?,"Studies show in nuclear families (Mother, Father, son, daughter) whether they mean to or not parents are treating there sons a lot differently to their daughters.

 **Types of praise** 

&gt;[Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3655123/) has shown that, although overall boys and girls receive the same amount of praise from their parents, the type of praise they receive differs. [Process praise](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/studies/19-the-one-about-the-parental-praise) (defined as praise for a child‚Äôs efforts and strategies) accounts for 24.4% of the praise boys receive, whereas for girls it only accounts for 10.3%. Being given more process praise from a young age (14-38 months) puts boys at an advantage, as it makes them significantly more likely to have developed a [growth mindset](https://www.innerdrive.co.uk/how-to-develop-a-growth-mindset/) by age 7-8.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore, girls are more likely to lack a [growth mindset](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/how-do-you-actually-develop-growth-mindset) regarding intelligence, and hence attribute their failure to inability, causing a decrease in [persistence and motivation](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/strategies-to-develop-a-growth-mindset), which has the potential to cause a decline in academic performance. This attribution was particularly pronounced for stereotypically male domains, such as maths and science.

 **Educational impact**

&gt;[Parents have differing beliefs](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1128973.pdf) about the maths abilities of their sons and daughters, despite actual performance being similar. Parents believe that, to [succeed in maths](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/maths-growth-mindset), daughters must try harder than sons and consider advanced maths to be more important for sons, as it enables them to enhance their ‚Äònatural‚Äô talent.  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, the stereotypical beliefs held by parents influence their child‚Äôs beliefs about their own abilities more so than their past achievements. This suggests that parental stereotypes may be limiting their daughter‚Äôs scope for academic achievement, an effect that may have long term implications in terms of [aspirations and career choices.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13803610600765851)

**Interests in school**

&gt; Evidence suggests that [parents are more likely to be involved with the school](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/29737745.pdf), such as attending school meetings and contact teachers, when they have a son. The same research also more worryingly showed that parents are likely to have saved more money to further their son‚Äôs education. Not having the same financial support from their parents may stop daughters from maximising their full academic potential. 

 **Time investment disparity** 

&gt;It appears that [fathers are prepared to invest more time in a son than a daughter](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/29737745.pdf), an effect which is thought to occur because fathers and sons have common ground and can share masculine activities. However, this effect is unfortunately not counterbalanced by mothers spending more time with their daughters (instead, mothers share their time more equally). Other [research](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1974-32082-001) has shown that parents are more likely to engage with their son‚Äôs play rather than their daughter‚Äôs. Together, these findings suggest that parents interact more with sons than daughters, which has an impact on their social skills in later life.

I have read many anecdote's online from women and girls who describe being treated differently from their brothers noting that they are often relied on for housework while their bothers are taken care of. as for me personally I have been from a single parent household (since my father died when I was 16 ) and have a sister, so these are all issues I've never experienced personally. 

I imagine these disparities between how we treat our daughters vs sons doesn't just have a negative impact on girls but boys too, in worse case scenarios where daughters are relied on for housework sons are doted upon, sons are left with poor culinary and household skills.

Interesting article:  [8 Benefits Of Having A Sister, According To Science (bustle.com)](https://www.bustle.com/articles/78072-8-benefits-of-having-a-sister-according-to-science#:~:text=Not%20only%20do%20the%20siblings%20benefit%20from%20the,Make%20Their%20Brothers%20Better%20At%20Talking%20To%20Women) 

It doesn't seem fair that the Sex of a child's sibling should determine how likely they are to succeed in life. so how can we change this and why don't enough people know about this ?  

how else do these differences disadvantage both boys and girls?",1
'only in freeing the oppressors can the oppressed truly be free'. do you agree with this statement?,"i swear i've read it on a reddit sub and i just dont know where to find it anymore but it really struck me because of the thoughts ive had regarding the phrase.

in the context of homophobia (specifically homophobia targeted to cisgender men), i think theres a lot of intersectionality with homophobia and toxic masculinity. only if we rid men (specifically cisgender straight men) of toxic hypermacho patriarchal expectations can we truly be rid of homophobia. the way i see it, they feed off of each other, *men should act like this, men should like this, if you aren't, you're feminine, and feminine=gay, gay=weak/bad*. so in a way, the oppressors (cis straight men), if freed of the shackles of the system they themselves perpetuate, can finally truly free queer men of judgment from sexuality.

in the context of feminism, only in ridding men of these mental cages of societal expectations (that the man IS the breadwinner of the house, that the man does the LABOR, that the man SHOULDN'T be doing this, doing that, can only like this, like that) can we expect women to also, truly be free of the expectations of a patriarchy.

Are women the biggest cause of patriarchy?,"Sorry for the stupid question, but im stuck.

I live in a conservative country.  When i claimed men is the biggest cause of patriarchy, my mom objected me, claiming that women was, in fact, the biggest cause of patriarchy.  She explains her reasoning as this: Traditional family structure is much more common in here, and mothers spend much more time with their kids than fathers.  So mothers have much more affect on the childs mindset than the father. But since the mothers also value patriarchy, they construct their kids identity based on their gender roles. For example: ""prepare food for your brother/father, dress like a girl, why would you study?"" etc etc. They also flatter the boys too much by saying ""you are a man! you can do it! anything for my boy! find yourself a girl who can take care of you"" .  You get the idea.

Bc of this, she claims that women are, in fact, more responsible for this situation than men, bc they are the main educators of the children.

To me she does have a point and i dont know how to argue her from here. The debate can go to ""well but what is the origin of patriarchy?"" road, but we are arguing from the ""maintaining it in todays world"" side, not the origins. She also stretches her argument saying that the mothers become this way...because of their own mothers lol.

How can i debunk her? (without rejecting that mothers do spend more time with the children than fathers, bc this is sadly how my country is)",1

Is it really possible to criticize leaderless movements?,"Or more specific to this subreddit, is it possible to criticize Feminism and Men‚Äôs Rights as a movement? 

To preface: I‚Äôve never already discussed this with r/TrueAskReddit and they gave a lot of interesting answers/posed some equally interesting questions. I thought it would make sense to ask people who identify with an actual leaderless movement that I don‚Äôt particularly sympathize with. To be transparent, I‚Äôm a guy, I identify with left wing male advocacy and I‚Äôm very critical of a lot of feminist thought. Despite that, I‚Äôm NOT here in bad faith and will try to engage with each response fairly and honestly.

My girlfriend and I were having a bit of a discussion about leaderless movements such as feminism, Men‚Äôs Rights, Black Lives Matter etc. During the discussion, I realized that when we differed, it was because we often had different subjective experiences and perceptions of each movement. Looking at the discourse around each movement I‚Äôve seen that much of the disagreements around the movement stems from a fundamental disagreement with in the *essence* of a movement: whether a movement is really this or that. 

For example, a Feminist, seeking to discredit the Men‚Äôs Rights Movement, might point to problematic quotes from Paul Elam, Karen Straughan or problematic quotes from the MensRights subreddit. They might use that to say: ‚ÄúSee the MRM is a male supremacy movement that seeks to establish men as more important than women and maintain a patriarchal society.‚Äù A MRA might reply that those people‚Äôs are ‚Äúbad apples‚Äù or are simply ‚Äúproblematic individuals‚Äù and disavow them while saying that those quotes are edge cases that don‚Äôt actually reflect the values and aim of the movement. The movement is simply trying to give men voice and highlight ways in which men are institutionally disadvantaged in society. 

This argument can obviously happen in reverse using quite demeaning and terrible quotes from feminists that can be perceived as dismissing male victimization. And when confronted with the quotes/evidence, the feminist might say that the criticism lacks a basic understanding of what feminism actually is and what the values and terms in feminism actually means before proceeding to give a subjective definition of feminist concepts. 

Obviously this can go around for days and get absolutely nowhere because they‚Äôre both right and wrong because they‚Äôre giving subjective viewpoints of what something means and dismissing anything that doesn‚Äôt fit their definition. 

So my question is, is it possible to criticize movements that don‚Äôt have a central leadership?

EDIT:

I think this conversation has run it‚Äôs course for the most part and while some might think this is a unless rhetorical exercise, I still think this is deeply important because agreed upon definition is what create the context in which we can communicate about certain issues.",1

This to me is immensely troubling.

Equally troubling is how it is often presupposed that the accused is guilty just by the reported victim's or survivor's saying that they are the guilty (**No, I am in no way saying, suggesting, implying or defending any claim or person who says that a person who claims to have been raped mustn't be taken seriously.

Do you believe it's damaging when people call themselves feminists when they aren't even educated on the movement?,"Currently, there are a lot of people who care about equal rights, I guess, but in general, a lot are also unaware of what the movement is actually about and are not consciously educating themselves on it. This leads to a lot of them advocating for feminism but at the same time also misogynists themselves(not purposely but because they were conditioned to think that way). So while they call themselves feminists, they also betray the cause when they interact with others. They don't deal with their internalized misogyny first before they call themselves feminists. I feel like this way is damaging to the movement but I'm not quite sure so I'm asking. 

I'm asking this because I'm also guilty of this. I called myself a feminist back when I was 16 and I didn't even exactly know what it was about. I advocated for equal rights yeah, I defended women, rejected victim blaming, spoke up against rape jokes and homophobia, but substantially, was still misogynistic without me being aware.

I got a question here about fragility...,"There's a question here that sparked this. Basically, it's about 'overcoming fragility"".

 Basically, it's when some feminists or females say sum about males. And males react with 'notall'. And people assuming this is fragile male ego based on how males react in this manner.. What I dont get is how is, how is this fragility? Isnt this having self-respect? Not letting others walk over you? Why does not tolerating insults or disrespect make you a fragile male\\?",1

What would you consider are the main similarities and differences between Feminists and Male rights movements?,"As a male who is nearly growing into adulthood, I've been getting into politics more. Although I don't completely perfectly agree with either ideology in it's entirety, I see positives in both. With that, I've also seen many similarities but I'm not in the position to outright state their significance of those similarities due to my light education on the subjects.

Thus, What would an average feminist think is the similarities and differences between the two ideologies",1
"Why is there little to no interest in regards to the effects of lack positive/safe role models for girl's/women? Most importantly, what are the effects on girl's/women and why are they disparaged, dehumanized and degraded for men's failures?","The only time I really see an acknowledgement (and a poor one at that) is when people mostly men say a woman ""has daddy issues"".  Of course this is just disparaging and gaslighting women for the failure of men in their lives.  The conversation surrounding boys/men is very different.  Not only do they dominate the conversation making girl's/women invisible but society has a hell of a lot more interest and compassion for boys/men that lacked a good male role model.  

One of the reasons I believe is due to the fact that men/boys act out disproportionately violent and destructive to themselves and  society in general.  It's another social problem where boys/men are the squeaky wheel that gets the grease.  While girls/women are disparaged and degraded by society for being failed by the men their lives that see's the consequences as something that puts women on a stripper pole, prostitution and of course having ""daddy issues"".

I can't tell you how many times my male co-workers praised me for simply being in my daughter's life.  My mere presence was saving them from the stripper pole/prostitution.  Because to men, ""slutty women"" is the worst possible outcome of being fatherless.  I wasn't praised for my presence with my sons, saving them from gangs, mass shootings, crime or drugs.  No, my greatest gift as a father was saving my girl's from being ""sluts"".  Despite the fact that many of these dudes would talk about exploiting women sexually that they felt had ""daddy"" issues.  They were considered easy targets.

My question is, why is there little to no interest in regards to the effects of lack positive/safe role models for girl's/women? Most importantly, what are the effects on girl's/women and why are they disparaged, dehumanized and degraded for men's failures?

"Thoughts on ""it's harder for women to find a partner as they get older""?","I hear this often.. One point that gets brought up a lot is that women can't have children after a certain age, and this pressures women to find a partner while they can.. I feel stuck hearing this as a response that comes up time and time from different people.. What are your thoughts?",1
"What is your opinion about ""strategies"" for gender equality (i.e: be more aggressive than necessary, for the benefit of the women who can't)","Hello!

Recently, I've engaged with multiple activists in my local context that have taken radical and strategic postures regarding multiple topics, and this has interested me. I've found myself doing so as well. I'll give a few examples:

* A fellow journalist is investigating minor corruption cases with me. We have a list of 200 people we're investigating. She insisted we focus on males first and only go after the women if we have time afterwards, since they are so easily targeted while the men are so easily let off the hook on these corruption cases. I agreed with her, even though this is _technically_ wrong from a strict, traditional, ""pure"" journalistic approach (of course, journalism has been taught with a male gaze, it's technique is not apolitical).

* A fellow classmate recently shared a tweet explaining how whenever another feminist says she's being ""unnecessarily aggressive"" about something, she thinks to herself ""I need to do this so that women who come after me don't have to"". I wouldn't disagree with her, it makes sense; sure, it can be disruptive In a bad way, but in my personal experience it is tremendously useful for other women to have an ally like that in the workplace, and to know that she can help them if they feel they're not willing to confront someone or something.  

* My boss (a feminist woman) and I needed to headhunt two colleagues for a gig doing policy reporting. We agreed to make a list of women and men, but contacted the women first to make sure that each and one of them would be presented with the opportunity before the men were. Sure, we _could_ have picked at random, or we could have gone for ""parity"" picking one man and one woman, but somehow we felt it was strategic to try to get even more women on the team. 

Since I've started actually working on gender equality professionally, I've seen a lot of people (including myself) adopting ""strategies"" that are geared towards long-term goals but that are not immediately or ""technically"" correct. I want to ask you what your view is on these sort of ""strategic"" actions that can be counter-intuitive or even considered wrong without context, but that quite possibly help build a real, effective gender equality. I suppose this can be seen as a re-hash of affirmative action but I don't think or feel it's the case: I think these are more nuanced decisions and they are, definitely, based more on political and ethical beliefs than on ""evidence"" or whatever.

Note: I'm calling these actions ""strategic"" because they do not offer immediate results, and can even be counter-intuitive in an immediate context. They are strategic because they aim to have an impact in the long run.

Still, I want to make it very clear that even if these decisions come from a political and ethical opinion and set of beliefs, and even though they are definitely not based on evidence, I do not regret any of them. I think that if I ask you to share your opinion of this it is only fair that I expose mine first: I think these sorts of ""strategies"" are necessary. Not only so: I think that any institution, team, workplace or community that supports gender equality *should* be thinking strategically, lest their ""support"" becomes little more than a good intention. This does not mean that I've not seen these strategies be unjust or myopic from time to time. Yes, they can fail, but they must be tried and implemented. That's my opinion anyway, what do you think?",1
BDSM and feminism,"Im 21, and have been seeing a lot from radical feminists on how BDSM and violence during sex shouldn‚Äôt be normalized. I agree it should not be normalized and assumed that that‚Äôs what people like in bed, but if i like it is that wrong?

I‚Äôve started to feel guilty for liking these things, almost like i can‚Äôt like them because they must stem from some trauma or misogyny. Is there anyway to deal with this dissonance?",1
What do you think of Female Gaze and Male Gaze in film?,"Recently,I found some comments on reddit and youtube, that said female gaze means inclusion of some shirtless muscle guys for female audience.  I want to share my thoughts though I might be wrong. I think objectifying is not good for either men or women. Fan service makes money, but not supposed to be a great art.  Most films in the past whether female led or not ,lacked woman's real point of view. They were portrayed as what men thought. Many women were even brainwashed by them. Lesbianism is a real deal for many women,but used and abused by hollywood as some kind of erotic material for men.Even in porn, lesbian sex is mainly for the hetero men. Only recently things are starting to change. Portrait of a lady on fire is the really great example. Although I am a man, I can really understand and feel the emotions of two women lovers,a very rare one. In contrast, blue is the warmest colour , with the very good story, is nearly destroyed by the unrealistic porn level scenes. Also, Little woman is one of the best film which can be enjoyed by both genders.For me, the female gaze means genuine depiction of women and exploration of their perspectives.
Undeniably the female gaze films are the real deal, and they are far from chick flicks and eye candy. But the major problem is still there, which is women centered stories are still underappreciated ,as seen in previous award seasons. I believe this is due to cultural and religious traditions, which almost always put women in supporting postions, so the wrong ideas are still ingrained in the society.We will see  whether they change in the coming season. Many have praised Joker movie as some kind of rebel man manifesto.Will they also do the same with Promising young woman?",1
I have some questions regarding the male gaze.,"I have been researching the male gaze for quite some time so I can have a deeper and nuanced understanding of the concept. You can answer as many questions as you like.

1. Since feminism have many schools of thoughts and disagree on certain things, **are there any feminists that do not subscribe to the idea of male gaze? If so, what are their criticisms of it, and do they hold water?**

1. During my research, I am getting the impression that the male gaze tells me how fragile the masculinity being portrayed in (Western) mainstream media. As a member of the 'stronger sex', I fail to see how we are strong by deriving power and status from the submission of anyone not us. Then the desire to overrepresent our gender comes across as narcissistic. Is this a common interpretation to have?

1. Given that media aimed for males can still incidentally garner a large female audience, **would you say the inverse is true**? In my mind, video games have a history of marketing towards males yet 50% of its audience is female. However, romance novels market towards women and [16% of its audience are men](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2016/romance-readers-by-the-numbers/). Does this trend follow for other media targeting towards women? Are men less willing to be fans of media marketed towards women?

1. To any women reading this: **Have you ever internalized the male gaze in your life? Do you see yourself as the human being you are or as how a straight man/patriarchy should see you?** Have you overcome this or are you still struggling with it?
 
1. I recently read and watch John Berger's Ways of Seeing. When he discussed the [portrayal of women in European oil paintings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZR06JJWaJM), this statement from him struck me: 

&gt; To be naked is to be oneself. 

&gt; To be nude is to be seen naked by others and yet not recognized for oneself. A naked body has to be seen as an object in order to become a nude. (The sight of it as an object stimulates the use of it as an object.) Nakedness reveals itself. Nudity is placed on display. 

&gt; To be naked is to be without disguise. 

&gt; To be on display is to have the surface of one's own skin, the hairs of one's own body, turned into a disguise which, in that situation, can never be discarded. The nude is condemned to never being naked. Nudity is a form of dress 

**Do you know any examples of art where naked women (or women being sexy) are shown as themselves and not for the male spectator?** Being portrayed as active rather than passive and available?",1
How to cope after your feminist awakening? (And everything seems sexist/harmful),"Im a woman. I've been a feminist for a long fucking time. But recently I've become even more involved in research and going deeper and deeper into the systemic inequalities that exist and how we can act in a way to fight them. Despite being a feminist for a long time, I call this my feminist awakening because I feel like its reached the next (metaphorical) level.

After my 'awakening', I've been feeling exhausted by all the mysogyny and patriarchal systems that surround me. I notice it everywhere. I feel suspicious of men, even those who are close to me, and I have less tolerance for beliefs that sit outside my own. I see sexism EVERYWHERE and I feel depressed and exhausted at the constant fight and fear.

It also makes me worried about what my life means now, when those I love may not have the same views as me. I try to educate them but I have a nasty feeling in the pit of my stomach that I need to be afraid.

Has anyone been through this? Does it get better? Any advice for learning how to live with this?",1

Why is marriage depicted as bad for men and good for women," 

I've always wondered this. In pop culture marriage is always depicted as something men are running away from and as something that women want. Historically, marriage has benefitted men, as they gained someone to do hours of unpaid labor for them and produce heirs. Even in modern day society, women still do around 2 more hours of unpaid labor then men PER DAY. This is even after working the same hours at work. Women's careers stall after giving birth while men's careers flourish.

So why is marriage depicted as a prison for men and not women?",1
Are transpeople a great equalizer for gender issues? Is it trans-phobic to generalize any issue as exclusively ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs issues‚Äù or ‚Äúmen‚Äôs issues?‚Äù,"I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot and I feel like one of the most beneficial outcomes of transpeople becoming more accepted in society is that this has the potential to bring all genders closer together.

What I mean is that if we are to accept transpeople as valid, which we should, then all gender issues now become *human* issues instead.

No longer can we say that pregnancy and abortion are ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs issues,‚Äù rather they are human issues because trans-men can become pregnant and get abortions too. 

Am I wrong? Do I need to rethink this?

If I‚Äôm right, I feel like spreading this train of thought could be really great for men and women finding common ground.",1
Male gaze: Is it an inherently bad thing?,"I've always had it sold to me that the male gaze in films is a problem because 99% of sexuality in films is done for an implied male, heterosexual audience. Therefore any LGBT+ members in the majority of films ever made have had their sexuality ignored while straight men (probably mostly white too) are overly catered too. Which is true, I imagine. Aside form Dr. Frankenfurther from Rocky Horror (and probably Rocky himself from Rocky Horror) I can't think of any famous films wherein someone is sexualized for the titillation of someone who is not a straight male of the top of my head.

Now ignoring that for a second, is there anything actually wrong with films/scenes that titillate straight guys in and of itself? If a straight dude is just enjoy that Salma Hayek scene from Dusk Till Dawn, so long as he doesn't have any notions that his sexual enjoyment is more superior to anyone else's, is it really a problem? Or to be moral does he have to pretend that he's doesn't enjoy what he is seeing, or something like that?",1
Teenagers and Feminism,"Hey everyone! I am a 16 yr old high school female and a proud feminist. I believe in empowering other women and educating my peers (of all genders) about what feminism really is‚Äî equality. 

While I have always known that women face a magnitude of inequalities since I was little, I have recently (within the past year or so) become very aware of all of the subtle sexist things that I face on a daily basis at school/during sports, etc. For example: I am acquaintances with some funny/sarcastic boys, and when I try to make a witty comment back at them, they often don‚Äôt respond or look away. If one of the boys said the same thing I did, it would‚Äôve been ‚Äúhilarious.‚Äù This frustrates me, yet I don‚Äôt know how to respond to since I guess it doesn‚Äôt really matter and I would come off as overly sensitive. 

Another example is that I always feel like I have to prove to myself and others that I can be just as good as boys in school and sports. I know that this is not necessary, but I feel like there‚Äôs this voice in my head that tells me that I need to. I feel like I heard this somewhere else (possibly on another subreddit), but someone described this well: it‚Äôs like all women have a male voice in their heads that tell them that they must live up to certain standards in order to be worthy of equality.

Finally, I hate when boys get upset that girls ‚Äúbeat‚Äù them at something, whether academically or athletically. This realllly makes me pissed.

Sorry for the lengthy rant, but I was just seeing if anyone could relate, and I was wondering if anyone has advice on how to (if at all) respond to these ‚Äúinsignificant‚Äù sexist remarks from my peers? Thanks!",1
Why are certain groups of men (and women) so afraid of men wanting to be more feminine and the glorification of feminized men in the media?,"For some reason, there's this ""boogeyman"" that's been conjured up by certain groups of people who believed that the media and feminists are trying to force men to become more feminine and show more emotion and this is ultimately a bad thing. I've seen this fear being brought up over the years and now I've recently been hearing that people are getting angry over Harry Styles wearing a dress and this is an attack of masculinity in the west. An argument they love to bring up is that every society needs strong men to survive and to protect their families. 

Why are so many guys against this? I hate the fact that these groups of people also bring this fear to the dating scene in which they claim that ""women want sensitive dudes but in actuality they want tough and strong men"". As a guy myself, it especially bothers me that this kind of mindset is used as dating advice among men, both online and offline, and that we categorize guys into two groups. That being ""alphas"" and the other being ""betas"".",1

Girl I met on a dating app messaged me late at night for a booty call. She wanted me to go to her place and I wanted her to come to my place. This went back and forth for a while until I eventually told her to get a taxi to my place and I offered to pay for it.

She wasn't impressed and accused me of mansplaining.

In retrospect, I could guess that she thought I think she's in need of money or not independent or something. However my intention with offering to pay was only to reduce any obstacles associated with my preference (effort of traveling and cost).

Was I in the wrong? Is that even mansplaining? What could have caused offense?",1

"Does anyone here have any arguments against ""rapists don't choose to act the way they do.

I see these ideas everywhere, ""don't play fire with fire"", ""those that do immoral things need love, compassion, and sympathy the most"", ""love, compassion and sympathy will help our cause, they are the only things that change people for the better"". 

The same ideas are used here to defend those that commit an immoral act. ""Rapists don't choose to act the way they do. It's all basic instincts to have sex and dominate that they can't ignore so it's fine and you can't hate and blame them for not being able to control themselves and ignore basic instincts. 

If a lion does something to you, you can't hate and blame the lion because the lion is acting on instincts. Rapists are the same way, they act on basic instincts.

You should show sympathy, compassion and love towards rapists, only they can change them for the better"" they say. From my experience of having interacted with these kinds of people, they say the same thing for other immoral things too, it's just they use rape as an example. 

What do you think? Does anyone here have any arguments against the claims I mentioned above?

Hi guys, this is my first time posting and I'm honestly a little nervous. I was arguing a TERF (do not recommend), and one of the arguments I used is that trans women face much of the same misogyny cis women, because they are considered by society to be women.

I need your input about my nice who strongly portrays herself to everyone as a strong feminist,"I have a niece who is now 29yrs old and very pretty. She has never worked in her entire life.

Then she goes back living at her parents until finds another guy. According to her that is the new way of feminism.

Is this really the new way of feminism? I'm just trying to understand what she is doing.",1

I am solely talking about **rationalizing** NOT agreeing. For example if you ask the FBI why Al Qaeda attacked the twin towers on 9/11, they'll be able to answer you comprehensively and give you a detailed report, but of course at the same time they don't *agree* with the attacks themselves. This shows that with rationalization they are fully on board 100%, while with agreement they are 0%. Is this how you feel about terfs? Do you 100% rationalize their views while 0% agree with them?",1

Edit: I see some people saying things that make it seem like I said sexism is in our DNA, and that it's ok to be sexist. I said it's natural to want someone UNDER YOUR BOOT, not that it's natural for a man to feel superior to a woman. It's the same with racism. I will never condone either, or things like homophobia, transphobia, e.t.c. things like that are DERIVED from the instinct, but are not hardwired. The only thing about this that's hardwired is the fact that humans always want to be the best, and we will do that through hate and oppression.",1
"What type of ""shaming"" is acceptable?","I was wondering what type of shaming is considered acceptable and what is considered unacceptable?

In addition, I think so called ""creep-shaming"" as the MRA extremists put it is acceptable in many cases because ""creeping"" is often just plain harassment. 

However, I feel that so called ""john-shaming"" (i.e., shaming people who purchase sex) is also unacceptable. I realise that might put me at odds with the sex-negative component of the feminist community but I honestly feel that if it's wrong to ""slut-shame"" than, ceteris paribus, it's wrong to ""john-shame"".

"Not sure where to ask this question, but whats are your thoughts on the 3 stages of womanhood ""maiden, mother, crone"" and is there an equivalent for men?","My mind is being blown right now as I'm reading ""The Crone"" by Barbara G Walter where she explains that before Christianity, the creator of the world, the spirit of earth, was female, and the ""Virgin Mary"" as the mother of God reborn was a way to make Christianity more palatable to prospective converts. In the story, Mary being a virgin mother, makes her the embodiment of the Maiden Mother, fertile yet pure, and excluding the Crone from sainthood.

"Discussion about legal and common definitions of rape, along with the limits of ‚Äúprosecutability‚Äù in regards to ‚Äúrape by deception‚Äù. A philosophical conundrum?","I will first say what I mean by the title. My apologies if it comes off as incoherent - I can‚Äôt think of a good way to say what I want easily right now.

What I mean by ‚Äúprosecutabilty‚Äù in regards to the limits of ‚Äúrape by deception‚Äù is how well a law(s) (if they exist) can incriminate people for deceiving their partner during sex (like lying about who they are, or in this case, taking contraception) without falsely incriminating people who didn‚Äôt actually deceive (like forgetting to take birth control, but say they did because they mistakingly think so)

I was just browsing the sex forum and I came across this:

[Redditor claims his ex-girlfriend lied about using contraception, and tried to ‚Äúbaby trap‚Äù him](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/kww7jr/i_m23_realized_i_might_have_been_raped_dont_know/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

He wasn‚Äôt sure if he was raped or not. I commented in there right away saying he was, but was quickly corrected that the legal and dictionary definition of rape does not consider his scenario to be rape (USA?). However, I think the OP is from France, judging from his post history. I removed my comments because I was speaking from ignorance. Many people said he was not raped.

Question: If ‚Äúrape by deception‚Äù is not acknowledged in the legal/dictionary definition of rape (or not enough to acknowledge men being deceived), should rape by deception be acknowledged? How well would it work? Is it justifiable enough to acknowledge it in the legal definition of rape?",1

Not like a government draft, but... it just sort of seems like a missed opportunity? I'm more confused than anything.

I've got the opportunity to be a model for a body positivity, lgtbq+ friendly overall amazing underwear brand (La Fille D'O). The style of the photographer and also owner of the brand is very direct; with visible nipples, hair and everything.   


I am an artist myself and my work is very much about the female experience especially about sexualization of our body. I go completely nude for my own photography, paintings and performance all the time. So even without this shoot my body is out there, in a direct way.  


I told my parents the news I would be doing this shoot. They had no problem with me modelling as a lingerie model, but they have a problem with this brand because it is too nude, too direct, overall not pretty. They came with the following arguments;

\- what would the rest of my family think?

What is the difference between transracial and transgender logic?,"Recently on Twitter, a tweet went viral of someone who went from white to black, they said they have always felt black and now they identify as black and they even used makeup to appear black. i think that its ridiculous and weird, but then I also thought why not? why can't you switch race? its just like switching gender, both gender and race are social constructs, so maybe in the future we will just be able to switch race.  do you agree with this? is it the same? iff not, why do you think it is different?",1
"Why do (self-professed) left leaning feminists prefer (a) (sexual)partners who dominate them sexually, yet appal such behavior outside the bedroom?","Contextualization:

After (re)entering the dating scene about 1.5 years ago I‚Äôve noticed a strange pattern with the women (straight/BI) I‚Äôve dated. Almost 80% of them declared themselves to be a feminist and (in)directly support the movement. Yet these women all desired to be treated like a conquest/prey/toy/property when it came to having sexual intercourse.

It seems kind of strange to me that a feminist wants to be treated like this sexually, while at the same time fighting such behavior outside of the bedroom (Yes, I understand that this is a kink for many people). Can someone help me understand where this comes from, do you recognize similarities yourself or do I just attract a specific type of feminist?

Women should just lower their standards,"Edit:   
I don't know why I get downvoted but if it's because of the title I'm terribly sorry. I should've put it in airquotes so it's clear that this doesn't reflect my opinion.

Hi, I've got a question.

My brother and I talked about incels and their inability to have sex and I've stated the argument that inceldom is bullshit because in human societies it's the rule that everyone eventually can get a sexual/romantic partner.

A little bit later he stated that incels have it worse because men (and by extension incels) have it harder on the sexual market than women because women will always find a guy who's desperate and horny enough to have sex with her.

I was sceptical and told him that there are women who can't have sex like femcels. He didn't believe that they even existed. I send him this [article](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/femcels-vs-incels-meaning-reddit-discord) and we still had a discussion where he just repeated that men have to ""earn"" sex while women can just go in a bar and ask a guy for sex. In his view femcels could get sex if they just lowered their standards.

I said that by his logic an incel could just have sex with a sex worker and then he wouldn't be a sexless virgin anymore and he just responded that it isn't the same because they didn't ""earn it"" because getting laid is an ego boost and when you don't ""persuade"" a woman to have sex with you, you don't get that ego boost.

So...

What would you say as a retort? Do you have ressources I could use that could help convincing him that this isn't how the world works?",1

How different would today's discussion on reproductive rights be if Silphium still existed?,"This might be an oddly specific question, but hear me out:

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently read a discussion online on reproductive rights in history and somebody brought up Silphium, which I found very interesting:

[Silphium](https://allthatsinteresting.com/silphium) was a plant used by locals of Cyrene (now Libya), and later the Romans, as a cure for various ailments. The resin from within the stalk would be used to treat nausea, fevers, chills, and even corns on the feet.

Its arguably most popular use was as an extremely effective form of contraception.

The plant acted as an abortifacient as well as a preventative measure. A single dose of the resin from the plant would induce menstruation, effectively rendering the woman temporarily infertile. If the woman was already pregnant, the induced menstruation would lead to a miscarriage.

Unfortunately, due to its popularity as a contraceptive and because Cyrene was the only place where the plant would grow due to a combination of rainfall and mineral-rich soil, it was harvested to extinction by the end of the first century AD.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my question is, as the title says: If this plant wasn't harvested to extinction, do you believe today's discussion on reproductive rights, specifically abortion, would be any different? I'm asking because back in the day, pretty much everyone had Silphium in their herb cabinet, making it a very easily accessible and commonly used contraceptive.

I personally believe that if such a contraceptive still existed today, it would heavily shift the discussion in favor of reproductive rights.",1

What are your opinions on the UFC and its ability to elevate its female fighters?,"For those who don't know, the UFC seems to be one of the few sports promotions that is very progressive towards their female athletes. The female athletes get paid the same as the male athletes, and are given the same exposure as the male athletes.

Although the fan base is predominately young white men, they usually seem to talk about the female fighters in a positive light. Despite some objectification, most female fighters are admired for being incredible skilled and resilient.

On top of all of this, different ethnicity's and nationalities are highlighted. Notable female fighters in the division are: Ronda Rousey, Amanda Nunes, Cyborg, and many more.

Why is consent treated differently for sex than in other situations?,"I was summarily banned from two X chromosomes for asking this, so I hope to get a better answer here. The stance by this sub seems to be that drunk individuals cannot give consent and that all sex with drunk individuals is thus by extension rape. This causes some issues when both individuals are drunk, which would imply that both are raping each other, but that‚Äôs not the meat of my question.

This idea seems to originate from statutory rape, which has significant legal backing and argues that children cannot consent and thus any sex with children is rape. However, this is where the parallels end.

Children are (in most Western jurisdictions) excluded from being able to conduct business transactions, since they cannot make autonomous decisions. If my child were to open a brokerage account and blow all his money on speculative instruments, I could take the brokerage to court for allowing a child to trade on their platform. If my child were to buy a car, I could return the car and get the money back or again take the matter to court. If the car were damaged, I would have to pay the damages since I am responsible for my child.

If I got drunk, blew all my life‚Äôs savings on speculative instruments and sued the brokerage on the basis that I was drunk at my computer, no court would rule in my favor. If I damaged someone else‚Äôs property while drunk, I would still be liable and have to pay damages. If I killed someone while drunk, I would likely get a more lenient sentence, but I would still do time. In no other context does being drunk absolve me of my responsibilities or nullify my decisions as it literally is my fault for getting drunk. What‚Äôs more, in the case of DUI, I would be punished under a law designed exclusively to punish drunk people deciding to drive.

My question is then why do some feminists‚Äîmy brief research on this sub suggests that it is the orthodox view here‚Äîabsolve drunk individuals of being responsible for their decisions when it comes to having sex? I don‚Äôt want to put words into anyone‚Äôs mouth, but you wouldn‚Äôt do it for any other potentially life-altering situations such as blowing your fortune on speculative financial instruments and forcing the brokerage to cover the losses, or getting into a car after a bottle of tequila.",1

Oversexualisation or slutshaming ?,"Hello evrybody.

Today I saw a press cover for a metal journal.
It was about a female frontes band and only the female singer was on the cover, in a very tight and very short dress with high heels etc... there was also a photo of a man on the cover : he was playing guitar at a concert. The photo of the woman is much more erotic and the photo of the man much more in context.

The other covers of the magazine are bot that bad but I realised that when they talk about masculine band they show the entire band and when it's female fronted band, it's only the lead singer in big.

It felt bad to me because I really felt like the lead singer was oversexualized. They have much more to offer than just their look !

But I'm conflicted because I don't want to shame someone to like dressing sexy or to like theses kind of photoshoot...

"How do you feel about Jordan Peterson's message that ""men like things and women like people""?","I struggle with this, because some of Jordan Peterson's messages bother me but others are things I've experienced in life. 

----

For example, right now I work as an interior visualization artist and I'm the only male on my team. I just notice that my co-workers prefer to talk about stuff like what they did with their SO's, social interactions that they've had, and when they mention things that they did on the weekend it's usually something more social or involving other people. Even the TV shows that they talk about like one called ""Love is blind"" or something is usually a TV show that involves a more social setting. I'm finding it very hard to have interactions with them that I enjoy because of how different our interests are and I'm considering switching back to game design.

------

However, when I use to work in game design prior to covid, my team was all men and one woman - and we talked about typical guy stuff like sports (boxing, martial arts, etc.), gaming, new anime fighting shows, cars, etc.

We always tried to include her in our conversations but she seemingly had nothing to contribute or had no interest, and she eventually quit for reasons I don't know.

----------------------

I guess it could just be a difference in personalities rather than gender, but when I started thinking about it I just noticed that throughout my life when I'm with men we talk about things or concepts but around women I'm forced to talk about people or social stuff. Now obviously this is a personal experience and may not reflect society - but I was curious if feminists think that there is any sort of accuracy to Jordan Peterson's statement that *""women like people, men like things""?*",1

How can I talk to my boomer dad about his toxic masculinity?,"My (26m) dad (51m) has fallen out with my sister (21f) because her first bf in years fell asleep accidentally in her bed, after my dad had said that he couldn't sleep over. 

My sister has mental health issues and I've not seen her this happy in years, her guy isn't text book bf material but he's clearly very good for her. 

When I brought my gf over for the first time my dad had zero issues with her sleeping over, he has zero issues that my gf is unemployed.

However with my sister. Not only did he forbid her bf from sleeping over, he also got so angry when her bf accidentally fell asleep in her bed. And he has been vocally bothered by the fact that my sisters bf is unemployed. When asked about this double standard he said something along the lines of ""it doesn't matter if his gf is unemployed because he will be working whilst she is pregnant and looking after the house"".
And he also has also tried to prevent and been vocally against my sister having sex, when he displayed no such aversion to my sex life. When I was sleeping around, I'd tell him where I was going and what I was doing, and we'd laugh about it and that was it. But if my sister wants to sleep with her actual bf, he has a huge problem with it. 

How can I show him that his toxic masculinity is ruining his relationship with his daughter. He won't be very receptive to ""progressive vocabulary"", and I don't really know where to start with him. I just know that I need to do something before it really does something irreparable to my sister and her mental health.

Update:
I called him, it went great. Thank you so much for your advice. I went at it from the angle of how its making my sister feel, whilst showing him how he treats us differently and how that makes my sister feel. I told him that he needs to tell my sister that he is not going to make it difficult for her to see her bf, and that he will be supportive of the relationship, just like he was with me. And he AGREED!!

If you could create your own society from scratch would you maintain the concepts of masculinity and femininity as something useful?,"It's hard to imagine that men and women would behave the same way and and have the same interests if there were no gender norms, but is there an argument that the concepts of masculinity and femininity are restrictive prisons for humans?

Insulting language that isn‚Äôt ableist?,"Hi. I want to preface this by saying my brother is disabled and I absolutely do not wish in any way to use ableist language or accidentally perpetuate any ableism, which is why I am here to ask the following questions. Also please excuse my usage of ableist and potentially ableist terms throughout this post, I just need to explain my point and obviously I need to use these terms to explain my point. 

I recently learnt that the term ‚Äòcretin‚Äô originated as a medical term, please excuse that I can‚Äôt remember the exact condition it was a term for. But basically it means that using this word in an insulting way could be ableist. 

This got me thinking, if I, and as I‚Äôm sure 99% of other people, are completely unaware of the etymology of the word and it‚Äôs links to disability, does that still make the word ableist? If the word only exists for most people as an insult or a variation on ‚Äòidiot‚Äô (which I also understand is problematic too), then is it ableist to use it if it‚Äôs developed waaaay past its original usage to the point where I‚Äôd likely say it‚Äôs not used for its original purpose at all anymore? 

I also had the question of, if I want to insult someone and call them an idiot, how can I do this without using potentially ableist language? I obviously will not use the word ‚Äòretard‚Äô, and understand words like ‚Äòlame‚Äô, ‚Äòdumb‚Äô and ‚Äòmoron‚Äô are problematic too. I just wondered if there were any words that could safely be used and considered not ableist. 

I do not want to come across like I‚Äôm saying ‚Äúbut why can‚Äôt I use those words!‚Äù I more so wanted to start a discussion on where the line of acceptability and non-ableism can be drawn in terms of this area of language. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve began thinking about and I think it‚Äôs important to recognise the roots of these words, but it is also important to understand the widely understood meanings of these words. Which is why I‚Äôd like some input from anyone who is willing to have an open conversation on this topic, and if anyone reading this has any varying disability themselves, I would extremely appreciate any input or opinions you have on this topic. I hope I don‚Äôt come across badly through this, it‚Äôs just a curiosity and a desire to understand the language I‚Äôm using and what words I need to remove from my vocabulary vs what is still acceptable.",1

What do you think of Pauline Harmange‚Äôs ‚ÄòI Hate Men?‚Äô,"‚ÄòI Hate Men‚Äô (or *Moi les hommes, je les d√©teste*) is a book released this past August by French feminist Pauline Harmange that, according to Wikipedia, calls for a feminist reclamation of misandry:

&gt;	In the 96-page booklet, Harmange aims to ""understand misandry and to give it back the right to exist."" According to her, feminists have always needed to pretend not to hate men so as not to lose them as allies. But in her view, misandry is not only ""perfectly justified, but also necessary"". She advises women to reduce their relationships with men and toxic masculinity, in order to rediscover the benefits of the ""sisterhood"" among women.

Naturally, this caused a lot of controversy when the French Ministry of Gender Equality initially tried censored it for inciting hatred, which was eventually reversed when there was an outpouring of defense for Harmange and the book. It sold thousands of copies versus the originally printed 400, and will soon be translated into English.

What should be understood about the book‚Äôs ideas and controversy? Is there something worthwhile about adopting misandry into the feminist movement? Or would it be a toxic and disastrous decision?",1

Concept of revocable assent for teens engaging in sex,"This lawyer, Jennifer Drobac, works in sexual harassment law and has written on the sexual exploitation of teenagers. Her proposed framework for age of consent is: 1) raise the age of majority from 18 and 2) for young people within a certain age range (e.g., 16-21), allow them to ""assent"" to sex with significantly older people, such that after a time, if the young person feels they were exploited, they can retroactively revoke their assent, making the encounter nonconsensual. 

I understand that alternatives to this are to simply stagger the ranges in which people of certain age ranges can legally consent (e.g., 18 can only go as young as 17, 19 can only go as young as 18, etc.), but Drobac's assent law may be interpreted as more liberal, i.e., the concept of assent permits a 16 year old to have possibly damaging sex with someone significantly older, and only provides protection in retrospect. But her argument for this liberalness is that teens need to learn to make important decisions, lest ""we risk retarding their growth and maturation."" She then says that ""if we tell teens to ‚Äújust say no‚Äù to sex, we deny a normal part of their  development and sexual exploration that must occur in an  age-appropriate way.""

Opinions on this approach? Is it worth it, while raising the age of majority, to also allow older people to have sex with people below this bright red line, so long as they are provided protection in hindsight, so that society's teens can still develop normally? Drobac argues that this would be a powerful mechanism for dissuading many predators, because they may not want to have the possibility of someone retracting their consent, years after their fact, hanging over their head.

Regarding fictional male characters objectification,"Hello there!

I'd like to consider myself a feminist - I'm afab, and I see and recognize a lot of the misogyny and sexism that's in our culture.

Basically, I expressed how I found this fictional videogame character hot, and that was the main reason I liked him as a character. I was then told that was gross, and that I was being objectifying. I want to ask - was what I said weird, and objectifying?  

I don't really know what to think myself, because if a guy told me that the main reason they liked a fictional videogame woman was because she was hot, I wouldn't really ... be bothered? But maybe I'm wrong on that too, and for that reason I wanted to hear different opinions.",1
A question on abortion in a hypothetical ideal future: All thoughts are appreciated,"Hey, so curious it‚Äôs question, would there be an ideal world where abortions wouldn‚Äôt need to be a thing. As a person who believes in the equity of all peoples, being an anarcho-communist, and that kind of applies to the unborn for me aswell. Abortion is just a hard topic for me, I agree with a lot of feminist thought, but I can never really form a full opinion on abortion, so the best I can do is hope for a scenario where it‚Äôs no longer a necessity. So would you think abortion would still need to be a thing of in this hypothetical world(from an American standpoint) sorry non Americans if some of this already applies to you, we kind of live in a third world country pretending to be first world! But if you could give birth without financial cost(entirely free!) and knew that your child was going to be given another place(not necessarily in a generic nuclear family unit) to be fed, educated, and grow up to be a great person without you needing to take care of the child or even ever here of it again. And since we live in a capitalist society you could even get a nice check(my original ideas come from a non monetary society, but hace to update for more realistic sensibilities). I  understand the idea that it is a woman‚Äôs choice, and I respect that as I‚Äôm not going to bad mouth someone for doing it or be one of those weird people who protest outside clinics, but there‚Äôs got to be a way, right? Maybe it‚Äôs a bad example, I‚Äôm pretty bad at expressing my ideas into written word, but could there be a world of no abortions? Thank you for any and all opinions, I just really want to hear peoples ideas. I hope you have a good day wherever in The world you may be.


Edit: I wanted to add an apology for coming off as ignorant. I realize I have much to learn about this topic and am eager to learn from everyone here. I know this is a sensitive and traumatic topic and I probably come off as acting like a fool who thinks it mean nothing, and I apologize for that perception. I‚Äôm not always the best at conveying my emotion in written word, much less spoken, and I want you all to know that I appreciate everything you guys are giving me to grow my knowledge. I appreciate it all greatly. Thank you!

Edit+: Alright, thank you everyone for your insight. I‚Äôve learned a lot about abortion and a bit about humanity on Internet forums, which I should‚Äôve expected(I think someone with a lot of alt accounts just came by, probably). It is all appreciated toward my ability to grow my knowledge in hopes of creating a better world. I will no longer be responding to anymore posts(for my own sake mostly) and hops this thread will be a place of positive discourse on how this topic applies to other people. Gracias, and all of you have the time of your lives!",1
What do you think ADOS (AFRICAN DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES) and their views on liberals and feminism as whole? As well as what you think of Pan-africans?,"ADOS means AMERICAN descendants of slaves. Basically, a black american who's here as a result of slavery. They're all around social medias. You can read about them, or I could post links if needed. But they mainly reside in the corners of twitter or yt. 

Pan-africans are black people who believe that ALL black people of african descent, no matter where they're from, should unite. What differs from ADOS and Pan-Africans is that ADOS are for BLACK AMERICANS descendant of slaves, and believe in reperations for them. And Pan-Africans is for every black person of african descent.

I've seen a lot of what ADOS/Pan-africans have to say. Particularly about politics and such. They're an explicitly anti-feminism group. They believe that it's a group for white women. Or white people in general. And often bring up their past as a reason they don't support it. And believe feminism is nothing more than brainwashing and a destruction to their communities.

In general, frrom what I've gathered, both groups don't support or vote for any politicians/candidates who AREN'T black. They only support black politicians. And only when these politicians made it clear they center black people in their TOP 5 priorities. Most of them didn't even vote (what i read again) in this past 2020 election. As they simply don't care, and see GOP and DEMS as political parties that don't care about them

Also, they absolutely has the term person of color. You'll get called names if you refer to them as that. Not to mention, in my experience, they tend to be VERY hostile towards non blacks.

So what's your opinion of them as whole? What do you think of them? Feminists who are black, how do you view? And feminists who are not black, how do you also view them?",1
What do you think of barely legal women opening onlyfans accounts?,"To start off, I want to say that I am in no way against making onlyfans accounts, nor am I against similar jobs. However, I believe this harms young girls more than it helps. You see girls creating accounts as soon as they turn 18 and it just doesn't sit well with me.

I mean, it's good that they're given a platform in which they are in control, but I just can't get it off my head how they were led to this decision. Most likely, these girls were hypersexualized and fetishized when they were minors. I don't know if this is the right term, but isn't it possible that they were ""groomed"" to think that their body is for the public? I may be talking nonsense here so please do correct me if I'm wrong! Thank you",1
Any recommendations for podcasts or books or articles or anything to help cure my internalized misogyny?,Thanks &lt;3,1
So why are abortions morally acceptable?,"Please don't just spam me ""*stop trying to control women*"" ""*women should be able to do whatever they want to their own bodies*"", it doesn't hold up. What women fail to realize is that we don't want to control what they do with their bodies, it's just that the baby isn't apart of it. And for those that think the baby is her body, how many fingers does a pregnant woman have, 20!? I don't think so.

Well some people might say the baby is using up resources of her body, and they have no obligation to keep it alive. Sort of like if someone needed a blood transfusion from you, you can decline because you have no obligation to anyone else. But still what women fail to realize is that there is a *big* difference between passively allowing a tragedy to occur and actively triggering the events that lead to someone's death. Not only are you consciously making the decision to end someone's life via killing, but you act as if getting pregnant was completely random and out of nowhere. The baby was asked to be brought into this world you're irresponsible decisions did that.

Another argument most people make is, it is a fetus and not alive. This is probably the most tricky because we start getting a little deep. What constitutes someone as alive? Is someone in a coma alive? I mean someone in a coma as *VERY* little brain activities, so is it ok to pull the plug these people? Are the elderly with dementia worth putting down because they aren't responsive to the world any more? Most people would say that they've already been living, so to end that would be wrong. And it's like what? A prerequisite to living is you had to have lived??? Anyways that's just assuming they think it's alive (at any point they think it is alive in the womb). Some people might say if it is in the womb it's not alive. We'll if that's the case what's the difference between a child that's just been born and a baby in the womb for 6 months? There's not a lot of difference.

The last argument many people use is what happens to the baby after its born. I understand that life can be hard and having a baby probably just add to the problem but that understands no circumstances can you just kill someone out of convenience. They usually go off on a rant about how the baby is gonna live a terrible life and grow up poor. But you have you have to understand, you wouldn't kill a 2y/o  because it would convenient you, so you shouldn't kill an unborn baby. People will also say what about rape cases? And if I'm being honest I'm not entirely sure myself. I mean on one hand a child of rape didn't asked to be born and in the other the mother forced against her will.

But anyway I think abortions are morally wrong and if you think you got another reason I didn't consider or a counter-argument I'd love to hear it.",1
Do you think there are any gender double standards that *should* exist?,"People bring up double standards between men and women very often in gender related debates. That if a man does this, he's considered X, a woman does the same thing and she's considered Y, and that's hypocritical.

But are there any double standards between men and women that *should* exist in your opinion? Like someone brings up a certain double standard in an argument, and you go, you're correct, that double standard does indeed exist, and that's good - because it *should* exist.",1

On Sex Work [and other things],"So, I want to know your opinion on some thoughts that I have:

1\] Say, even if we remove the stigma of the sex work, porn, or onlyfans, we cannot eliminate the physical realities of the act itself. That is, if we remove moral and social judgement, and ensure the safety of the workers, you still have two groups of people : women who engaged in such activities, and those who did not. What to make of the information would be at the personal discretion of them and their partners, but my point is that two groups will exist.

2\] Expanding on the idea of physical realities - When it comes to women being obese, or not wearing make up, or not trimming body hair, I think there are two separate issues here. The first issue is that no woman should be treated badly because they are obese, or refuse to wear makeup, or do not trim their body hair. Nor should they be forced or expected to wear makeup and trim their body hair - which is fair, and that is the way things should be. The second issue is that relationships operate as a free market. So you have to realize that your position there depends on your attributes -being overweight, not wearing makeup, or not trimming your body hair might affect your chances to attract a partner \[Again, this is true for men too, with different attributes, but no movements are based around men being fat, and nobody cares about fat men while fat women are put on covers of magazines\]. So these two are very different issues, and while

3\] Isn't porn lucrative for women BECAUSE of the side-effects that it has?  I mean, if there is no stigma and no bad effects, and if any woman can work in porn without having to face any kind of repercussions - personal or professional \[so easy entry\], economics dictates that it would become significantly less lucrative to work in porn. I have already heard that onlyfans is not as lucrative today as it was a couple of years ago \[the median earning as of today is $136/month\]. If you recall the porn from the 1980's/90's and compare it to what passes as 'vanilla' porn today you would see that the latter is more 'violent' and 'problematic' and the women probably paid much less than they were then, plus you have a lot of competition. Also, there is money in sex work because it is restricted. If you legalize it, it would become significantly less lucrative. because you will have a proliferation of women who want to earn extra money on the side as compared to highly vulnerable women \[like the ones who currently do sex work\] which will be blindsided.  Think about the Bella Thorne - Onlyfans incident, where she earned a lot of money. If other popular actresses also open an onlyfans account, what would happen to the average woman on onlyfans? Why would people subsribe to her when at the same price I can see the content of a famous model / actress?

4\] Leading up to this - I think that if there were a scenario were sex work, porn, and onlyfans was not stigmatized, and it was like any other profession, it would lead to more brutal hierarchies on a much basic level - like looks and race \[things you cannot change\] and lead to some weird type of progress that cannot be determined at this point. That is, what proportion of women do you think can make a decent living out of this profession? What would be the median salary be like? In most other disciplines, you can work hard, study for an advance degree, or get ahead due to experience. Due to nature of adult work, the only way \[that I see\] to increase your profit is to go towards more 'extreme' ways of sex - like just notice how commonplace anal porn is today as compared to 10 years ago.

Coming to the point about race, consider interracial relationships. There are obviously more interracial relationships today than 10 years ago - which you might consider progress. But most of them are between Black Men and White Women, and very few Black Women and White Men. Okay, maybe we can attribute it to say Black Men being well represented in sports \[American Sports\], the music industry, and let's also include shallow women who might date them because of them being perceived as well endowed \[due to porn\]. Even accounting for all this, I think the ratio is very skewed. In media, I hardly see any Black Woman \[Non-Black Man\] pairings. Even in porn, where you might see every possible thing imaginable, Interracial porn is mainly between Black Men and White Women. Also, Even amongst Black Men, only a very small percentage have the privilege of being good at sports, music, well endowed, the other Black Men who do not have such privileges are probably going to grow more resentful over time \[if they already aren't \].

My point here is, on the surface it seems like progress is happening, but it is leading to more intra-group issues with a potential towards increasing tension within groups, based on things that cannot be changed \[face, height, musical talent\]. Like Black Men getting involved in majority of the interracial relationships, Attractive women earning the most money on onlyfans. Though women have sexual autonomy today, There also exists groups like femcels who are women which have no partners  \[around 30k members on reddit\], and I think the problem of invisible women \[the idea that women who are not attractive are non-existent\] has become more prevalent today.

In the end I don't think there is a way to truly demolish hierarchies - you demolish one, and new ones will be born. This can be attributed to the fact that human beings have very complex desires compared to other species. You think about other animals and they are so happy with basic food and shelter. My opinion is that at best feminism will be able to remove problematic behaviors like catcalling, objectification, workplace discrimination, and non violent sexual assault / harassment, but beyond that it is just unfathomable what the side effects of the other progresses would be - or even if those progresses can be long lasting, since I consider feminism a privilege of the economically prosperous nation. With changes in economy, environmental degradation, changes in the nature of war, this progress might roll back. ",1

AI and (species?) discrimination.,"I see some posts here about getting women into non-high paying fields like plumbing and welding. What are your thoughts on machines replacing humans in the future in these fields \[which is very much possible not too long from now\]? They do not present any of the problems that feminists are addressing today. A non human work environment seems like the most ideal one - it is devoid of sexual harassment and workers needing days off, at the least. For instance, we had sexual assault issues with uber drivers - it will be solved with a non human driver, but uber's main goal has always been self driving cars as cabs and transport logistics. There are just waiting it out until the technology becomes more safer and economically viable, which Tesla has taken major strides in.

One argument might be that maybe humans will pivot to tech careers. To which I want to comment that not everyone has the capacity, drive, and temperament to survive in tech. Also, being a software developer is radically different from working in a PURE Machine Learning / AI role.

Also, why are feminists focusing on getting more women in tech? As someone who was born to significantly well off parents and who has a high salary, there is no correlation between a high paying career and your happiness / fulfilment in life, which is why I think there are is lesser women in tech in countries with high GDP/Capita like Sweden. I don't mention careers like Medicine / Law / Business because you cannot make a 6 figure salary in your early 20's in those professions \[so the women in those professions are highly committed and have thought things through\] and need to get grad degrees to get top salary, whereas in tech you can get a decent salary even after attending some bootcamp. Moreover, it seems like you want companies to force men to take parental leaves too. Why don't feminists want to encourage more women to not have children, and encourage more women to have casual sex relationships? Wouldn't that be more liberating than women becoming mothers and basically companies or worse, taxpayers paying couples to have babies and at the same time restricting young men from doing extra work / overtime? Again you might say that ""well, a woman might work for less hours but she might do better quality work"" to which I say ""Surely, there must exist at least one man with the capacity to work more hours without compromising on quality""?",1

"" and, ""So nonAmericans can validly know that most of the cops here are bad, but antifeminists can't validly know that feminists are bad even with an abundance of evidence?""

With instance like:  ""Toxic feminists have petitioned the government to allow colleges to expel students ACCUSED (not found guilty) of rape based on preponderance of evidence, aka a 50.1% chance that a rape allegation SOUNDS plausible.""

Would a sociologically (and biologically) focused sex Ed classes help solve the sexist issues that hinder dating?,"Sex Ed should include teaching young people about consent, contraception (not just abstinence), male and female puberty. That‚Äôs what I learned and I believe I have a pretty comprehensive knowledge of the biological aspects based on that. 
However I believe a more sociological aspect also needs to be taught; how to conduct yourself around someone your sexually attracted to, how women and men differ,  how women and men are similar, that women enjoy sex too, and how people‚Äôs preferences in a partners differ (In features, sexuality and gender identity) etc. 

(Issues particularly in heterosexual relationships) I‚Äôve noticed, lurking on ‚Äúdating advice‚Äù spaces there are very many men who believe all women are the same; having the same preferences and believing women have it easier in dating. I think these are harmful, sexist opinions that stem from a serious misunderstanding of Sex and relationships. 
There are men who truly believe *all* women want is a 6‚Äù rich guy, disregarding the fact women are people: being taught that sex is something he does to a women not with a women. Assuming dating for women is easier simply because they are women. 

My questions for fellow feminists are; 

- is dating conduct something we should be teaching in schools along side Sex Ed? 

- have you noticed any other examples of sexism in dating? 

- are there any issues with how women conduct themselves in dating? 

- will a sociological aspect make sex Ed more LGBTQ+ inclusive? 

- What important things can be taught to make sex Ed more inclusive and less sexist?",1

"Feminists Livestreamers and Content Creators :How do you deal with sexism, on a mental &amp; emotional level ?","I have a few female friends who started Live streaming on twitch and youtube during covid and have been facing a lot of issues and harassment

I did already get some of the general actions and tips you can take

Have supportive friends or partners in chat, to talk with and help mod

Different games have different sets of viewers, so if possible try to find one that's less toxic.

making sure to take breaks and rests

While youtube and twitch have their official processes for dealing with harassment , reporting moderating censorship, muting, banning people

\------------------------

My focus for this post was how to deal mentally and emotionally level with actions, techniques

Feel free to reply on how you deal either in it general or individual issues I‚Äôve listed bellow

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Fake donations. Men who demanded my attention in chat and make me feel guilty about not replying or reading immediately.

Lack of communication or chat interaction without face cam. Insults on looks when I do have face cam.

One my biggest issues is that I don't get taken seriously, also I'm not traditionally attractive. Like I enjoy wearing low cut tops, like even when I'm not streaming. Like I try really fucking hard but this is difficult because of my mental health.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Not taken seriously, sexism, etc pretty much from the get-go. There are people on Twitch dedicated to harassing female streamers.

My successes are attributed to my gender instead of my hard work and talent

. A handful of loyal viewers who feel the need to defend or carry me, because I‚Äôm viewed as fragile and not \*as\* smart as males. Like it‚Äôs ‚Äúcute‚Äù that I play some video games. It‚Äôs strongly affected my personal bias towards my male viewers and that sucks because I know not all of them are like that, but when it happens a LOT more to women than it does to men...we kind of just assume first.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The relentless focus on physicality and age is just one of the challenges female creators face. There is a ton of harassment, stalking, threats.

have been at the burnout stage several times - due to harassment.

I don‚Äôt know how to advise, other than to simply take breaks when necessary. Thanks for this post and I think that perhaps younger women, or those who don‚Äôt have a very large following (or those who are ignorant) may be in denial about how the female experience differs to the male experience. There is a lot of unlearning to do.

People commenting negatively on my appearance- makeup, clothing etc. When it has nothing to do with my content at all. I don't do fashion, beauty, lifestyle etc. It's irrelevant. I'm sure most creators experience this at some point though, not just females

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

there is an element of ""why would i take advice from a female who can't even get her makeup/hair/outfit right"" that does seem mainly reserved for female creators. And getting the opposite ""you're so pretty you deserve more subs"" isn't less offensive.

Just scroll through comments of male creators vs females - and count how many comments relate to appearance vs content. The proportions are wildly different - even when the genre is unrelated..

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

All you see in my videos is an angle from above of a piano keyboard, my hands playing the said keyboard, and my legs underneath. The amount of times I get comments about my legs is ridiculous... ""cover them up, I can't concentrate"" and the like. I've had marriage proposals because ""your hands are beautiful, imagine what else you can do with them"" etc etc. It's a good thing I don't show my face... can't imagine how much worse things would be ???? I don't get too much harassment specifically for being female though I do get the odd ""it would sound so much better if a guy played this music"" ?

"What is your response to men who claim doing sex work is harmful to oneself and others, among other criticisms?","I had an interesting debate the other day with someone who said along the lines of:

- What if the sex worker has children, and the children find out their parent was a sex worker?

They said that the children would probably feel ashamed/embarrassed. Therefore, it‚Äôs wrong.

- How would *you* feel if you found out your parent was a sex worker?

I said in response it doesn‚Äôt matter how I feel about what they do, (I would admittedly feel embarrassed) I respect their choice in bodily autonomy. Who am I to tell what job someone should have?

Then, this was not part of the debate but I thought of it: 

- They brought up that sex workers/nude models have a hard time dating because of their line of work.

- Would I date a sex worker? 

I watch pornography, but I most likely would not date a pornstar out of insecurity/jealousy. Am I a hypocrite?

Should we try to eradicate preferences that are rooted in sexism?,"Not a regular in this sub, but I assume that there's a lot of threads asking about whether a preference (especially when it comes to attraction) is rooted in sexism.

A classic example would be that in cishet culture, height is a heavy factor when it comes to being attractive. Men typically prefer women shorter than them, and women prefer men taller than them. For some, it's even a deal-breaker. We can trace this back to the patriarchal notion that men have to be strong, protective, and dominant, while women have to be small, weak, and submissive.

Most feminists I've asked about this in real life have more or less said the same thing: 

""Yes, they are at least partly rooted in sexist notions, but everyone is entitled to their preferences. What's important is that we acknowledge that our individual preferences may be influenced by cultural factors and don't look down on those we don't find attractive.""

Personally, I agree with this conclusion.

However, one friend told me her opinion that really intrigued me. She said that we have to try to unlearn these preferences, especially if we acknowledge that they are caused (or at least influenced) by patriarchy. Because by respecting and accepting these preferences, we are also respecting, normalizing, and further perpetuating these harmful patriarchal notions which make them even harder to combat in the long run. 

I responded by saying that we can't blame individuals for being affected by the system. We need to go after the system itself.

She responded by saying that these are not mutually exclusive. These are still symptoms of patriarchy that we must also combat, the same way with how we fight ""petty"" sexist jokes while also demanding equal pay.

I'm curious what other feminists think about her opinion!",1
Wage gap question,"I have a real question but i dont want to trigger anyone. You have to understand i started my career right out of highschool in a blue collar 99% male profession. I'm not saying anyone is right/wrong or good/bad, i just want to catch some takes on the following completely hypothetical situation.

Jack and Jill are a married couple who got laid off. They can't find work in their field and the only option they have is roofing. Both have no experience in roofing and get hired by a contractor. The contractor starts Jack off at $20/hr, and Jill off at $15/hr because he believes Jack is stronger and can do more work. This is obviously discrimination... 

Now lets say both Jack and Jill start off at $18/hr. After 1 month it's been determined that Jack can finish and entire roof in 1 day, while the same roof for Jill takes her 2 days. Would it be fair to give Jack a raise to $36/hr, but no raise to Jill because they are both being paid at the at same rate (roofs completed per day)?

If this is discrimination how is it rectified? Should Jack be told to slow down and take more cigarette breaks? Should they be paid the same base salary and incentivized a commission or bonus based on how many roofs they can complete to everyone to keep moving?",1

A point often posted here is ""no one dies from lack of sex"". which is true buuut when you look at subs like the dead bedrooms and such you'll see that a lot of people feel VERY hurt by a partner that is not physically affectionate with them. And while it does not merit outrage being rejected sexually can hurt especially if it's a repeated experience. some experience days, weeks, months, or for some years of not feeling that desire and affection from others. At least not from anyone they'd welcome it from. 

Yeah there are more important things. But that can be said about a lot of things. It's all relative. So relatively speaking how important is sexual attention, affection, reciprocation and such? Considering that you don't need it to live, would the lack of it coupled with the feeling that no one will ever desire you in such a way have any actual harmful effects? IS it at all important? Or could you be expected to die a virgin who desires sex and shouldnt be bothered by it?",1
Sex Positive Feminism,On Cobra Kai I heard a girl talking about sex pos feminism and that just sounds so like me! Are an of you all sex positive feminists and if so y?  :P i think a lot of feminism is actually oppressive bc it makes us wanna not have sex and we should be able to choose what we wanna do!,1

Discussion: not conforming to gender norms seems more stigmatized than conforming?,"The portrayal of a ‚Äòpick me‚Äô usually tends to be women shunning traditionally feminine things.  While negative stereotypes exist about women who love femininity, it seems less stigmatized in that it‚Äôs considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or even favorable.  Same goes for men involved in traditionally masculine things.  

As a basic example, traditionally ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù or ‚Äúgothic‚Äù things are stigmatized moreso than women loving fashion and makeup or men (or even women, given the overall favoring of masculine things) loving sports. By stigma, I mean in the sense of being ‚Äúodd,‚Äù ‚Äúweird,‚Äù or just ‚Äúdeviant‚Äù from the norm.  Media itself perpetuates these kind of stigmas, and perhaps there is more to such stigmas in addition to not fitting gender norms? 

Men conforming to masculinity and women conforming to femininity seem to gain a certain power and social status, and in many settings can practice judgement against people of all genders who may be ‚Äúnerdy,‚Äù ‚Äúgothic,‚Äù etc.  I think the gamer girls who develop the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like other girls‚Äù resentment also come from having faced ostracization from feminine girls and more acceptance among fellow ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù guys (not justifying by any means).  

This is a discussion in that I‚Äôm sharing based on my observations and would love to hear others‚Äô observations and experiences.  Maybe there are also differences in what‚Äôs more stigmatized by environments and age groups?

Disclaimer 1: I apologize for any cisnormative language.  I‚Äôd love to hear perspectives from trans/non-binary folk.  

Disclaimer 2: If it‚Äôs relavant, I‚Äôm a cis woman, and I practice femininity to a small extent (on occasion).",1
Do you think the 3 year prison sentence on Sarah-Jane Parkinson was just?,"Sarah-Jane Parkinson is an Australian pathological liar that falsely accused her then fiance, Daniel Jones, of 32 counts of rape and domestic abuse.

This caused Jones to spend 4 months is a super max prison, where his life was severely in danger, as he was a prison guard himself before all of this started. He lost his livelihood, his reputation and his house.

Additionally, this left the Jones family destroyed.  Over the course of six years, the legal fees left his parents in debt of $300k.  This also caused his parents marriage to fail.  They will not receive anything back from the fees paid and no compensation for the damage done.

Sarah-Jane Parker was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment, eligible for parole after serving 2 years for these falsified accusations.

Honest Questions,"

So, I joined this group just to see out of curiosity what answers I could get, as I do have honest questions.

First things first, I will point out I am a white M17 and I am not 100% up on history involving feminism, though I have done multiple research projects on the subject.

So, a few questions to ask. 

First, and most importantly, what is it that feminism is truly fighting for?

Second, why are the only stories I hear about anti-men? I thought the main goal was equalize the playing field?

Lastly, What would be the plan to fight for the rights of women, those that aren‚Äôt already given?",1
"Why is sexist jokes towards men fine in feminist circle, but not the reverse?","Often times, I see feminists taking sexist jokes directed towards women seriously. And will then say that 'jokes are supposed to be funny'. Which they do have a point on that. But just look at feminists dismissing Clementine's sexist jokes as 'not a big deal' and bc she 'apologized'. Ur apology isnt sincere and doesnt mean much when you keep on repeating the same 'mistake' over and over again, and that you're known for that very thing. And other feminists argument against not doing anything about misandristic jokea? Women are dying, they say. Yeah, but a MUCH bigger of men are dying tho.

But then, these same feminists make sexist jokes about men. And when men react, we're dismissed as ""fragile men"", male tears, and the like. That they often call us privileged white men (I didnt know not agreeing with a sexist joke made me white. Interesting.)

Why is it that sexist jokes towards men is fine, but not the reverse, in feminists circle?

"Pro-prostitution feminists, how do you want to end the commodification of women?","Hello everyone!

I have only recently started to study the views of feminists. One thing I really like about it, is that feminism strives to end the commodification of women. As far as I am concerned, standing against prostitution - like anti-prostitution feminists do - and other kind of sex workers, could, in my opinion, help the situation. But so far I don't know how pro-prostitution feminists think that this problem could be tackled. I mean, people who engage in such activities (either by being a sex worker or paying for the service), greatly contribute to this phenomena.

So with this in mind, my question would be, what measures would you want to be taken and by whom to end/decrease the  commodification of women, if you support any type of sex work (be it prostitution, OnlyFans or whatever)?",1

What's your opinion of difference feminism?,"Hi :)

I'm doing A-level politics and we're studying Feminism as one of our ideologies, so any replies to this would help me understand it better :) 

We've briefly skipped over difference feminism and what it is, but it's generally overlooked because, as the textbook stresses, its ""extremely controversial among other feminist groups"" and difference feminists are only a minority. 

Although I wouldn't necessarily agree with it, it doesn't seem too extreme (as I would argue separatism is, though we skipped over that as well) or particularly controversial to disregard it completely. I feel like the exam board are being very careful about the content they include to not portray feminism as an anti-men movement, so really emphasise equality feminism.

Is difference feminism as controversial and a small a minority as the exam board/textbooks are saying? What's your opinion on it, are you a difference feminist?

Thanks very much, any replies would be much appreciated :)",1

How has slut-shaming and the way society frames women and sex poorly effected your sex life?,"The internet is, even at the best of times, a cesspit of misogyny and slut-shaming. Full to the brim with ‚Äúscientific facts‚Äù used to shame women for having sex, eg;

- multiple sexual partners stretch the vagina (but the same amount of sex with one person doesn‚Äôt have the same effect) 

-women who have had sex with more than two partners are more likely to get divorced.

Along with these, a plethora of misconceptions and hypocrisies regarding how men and women differ sexually‚Äî *men enjoy sex while women are meant to make sex enjoyable for men‚Äî women must be virginal and innocent but they must also be good at it and know how to please ‚Äúher man‚Äù, men on the other hand can be selfish in sex and have had many sexual partners.* 

Even off the internet people are so quick to slut shame someone simply because they don‚Äôt like that person, or a loose rumour.

**My personal experience, and how this has severely effected my sex life:**

I was fairly late losing my virginity (19) *in comparison to my friends* , the day after I lost it to the guy I thought would be my first real boyfriend, he broke things off over text and ghosted me. He was keen to ‚Äúplay the field‚Äù. 
The next time I had sex was a one night stand that turned into a relationship with whom I later found out to be a serial cheater. Many people called me a slut behind my back for this. He was a narcissist and very selfish in sex, but I didn‚Äôt know better. I finally ended things with him and went on to have several drunken ‚Äúone night stands‚Äù with guys I was/ am friends with in the years since. 
I‚Äôm now in my mid twenties and consider myself extremely inexperienced; I‚Äôve never really enjoyed sex, haven‚Äôt had sex sober in years out of shame and get very uncomfortable when anyone talks about it. And yet because I‚Äôve had more than 15 sexual partners I‚Äôm considered an unmarryable ‚Äúslut‚Äù by the standards of men online. As you can imagine this is rather confusing and damaging. 

This is just my personal experience and I‚Äôm dealing with it how I see fit. 

**So my questions are**

- has slut-shaming and misogyny effected your sex life? What‚Äôs your story? 

- how can we change things? Does the fault lie in sex Ed?",1

"I generally accept that men and women have roughly equal sexual appetites of 'libidos'.

Surely its not because of the wage or wealth gap, most pornography these days is free, and as for prostitution, the EXTREME discrepancy is female prostitutes catering men and male prostitutes catering to women doesn't seem to be explainable by any sort of economic inability for women to afford a male prostitute. Is it a power thing, men sort of subconsciously objectifying women in a way that women don't generally do to men? In a society that regarded men and women as truly equal, would prostitution die out or be highly diminished, including prostitution where the woman is doing so voluntarily? The same question for pornography. 

Is it not a power thing but something else?",1

GF used to be a willing side chick,"The relationship dynamic was one of objectification. The married guy objectified her and she liked it basically. His friends knew about this dynamic and they both got off on it when they hung out with them. The sex life was of the similar tone (him being really dominant and her doing whatever he asked of her). GF says she still likes being objectified and they broke off the hookup because of his marriage not because of how the relationship was structured. I've explained to her how getting off on objectification could be pretty dangerous for her psyche and she agrees, but the pleasure aspect is still there.

Not that it changes much but I've been with quite a few people who've been with quite a few people and it has never bothered me. No matter how graphic they were in describing their sex life.

This one got to me though. I'd like to consider myself a feminist (not a good one apparently) and want to get past this. One the one hand unlike some feminists I think there's actually an immoral aspect to her behavior. Namely that she has been immoral to herself in rejecting her humanity (by objectifying herself willingly). Of course there are societal factors as to why she's in the predicament she's in, but at the end of the day I believe that we can still choose freely (with bigger or smaller inclinations).

Honestly I don't care about him, this is not about jealousy as much as it is about her pleasure derived from objectification in that relationship bothering me.

I'd like to get a grip of this issue and would like to hear some possible arguments as to why I shouldn't consider it a big deal. I'm really posting this to change my mind.

Feeling a sense of failure after being sexually assaulted,"I went home alone on my city‚Äôs public transit system recently after having dinner with a friend. A man got on my train and immediately began to sexually harass me. It turned into assault when I tried to move away from him. Being in a moving train car felt like being trapped in a cage with him. It was awful. It felt like an eternity before we reached the next station. I bolted from the train and the station as quickly as possible. Then I stood outside crying until I was calm enough to go back into the station and report the incident.

I knew they would have security camera footage, but even so, I felt unhelpful. The police asked me if I knew what time the incident began. I did not know exactly. They asked for a physical description, but he had been wearing a face mask and I avoided eye contact with him. They asked if I knew what specific train/train car number I had been on. I didn‚Äôt know. They asked if I had taken a picture of him. I had not.

Are most people in these situations really calm, collected and bold enough to gather all of this information while attempting to remain as safe as possible? Am I just really bad at this? I almost didn‚Äôt even go back and report it. I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it or be involved in a potential legal case, and I didn‚Äôt feel like I had enough solid information. I feel like I panicked and failed. When I was sexually assaulted in my early 20s, I felt guilty for a long time because I felt I should have been able to prevent it. This time, in my  early 30s, I feel a sense of guilt because it feels like I didn‚Äôt react correctly. I don‚Äôt know if this is common.",1
Gendering of Certain Products for Men,"Question (explanation will follow):
Is the gendering of products like makeup/face soaps/etc for men (i.e. calling it Scooter McShooterface's Guy Liner for men) a product of toxic masculinity/fragile guy egos or is someone who leans towards buying ""for men"" products showing toxic masculinity. This being a really positive sub who can explain things, I was hoping yall could weigh in. 

Background:
I was on Twitter and saw the debate about gendered products (it was makeup for men). Most of the sides were saying that these products need not be gendered and gendering them is catering to fragile masculinity.

Now as someone who buys a lot of nice soaps/deodorants/etc i had a question or caveat to this i find the ""for men"" label helps. It tells me that the product has a better chance of working for my skin/being more effective. Some gender neutral products/ones that aren't excitedly made for men are not as effective on my skin from a moisturizing point or do a bad job of making me feel clean/stop B.O. knowing this i wonder if it is toxic or fragile to prefer that a product is gendered b/c it tells me about the product in two words.

What and who are AryanRadFemsUnity/Aryan Action Against Pornography and are they connected to radical feminism like they claim?,"Hello, i was browsing gab, which is this weird far right twitter clone for old people and racists, just looking and laughing at all the man trump supporters claiming that trump has won and will be still in power, etc

When i came upon a two groups, one called ""Aryan Action Against Pornography"" and another one called  ""Aryan Rad Fems Unity"". I wont link them here as i do not want to give them publicity and i am not sure the rules on it. 

The Aryan Rad Fems Unity group claims to be a group of ""radical feminists"" based in US and Canada. The group has a lot of transphobic posts, mostly memes, and celebrated some law in the uk stopping transgender stuff for under 18's. They mostly target sex workers and the porn industry however. 

The posts of these groups are pretty racist, homophobic and transphobic. They both post about how porn is  apparently turning children LGBT (often calling homosexuals and trans people slurs) and how it normalises ""interracial rape"" to children, other posts talk about mass doxing of both porn watchers and performers and calls for ""punishments"" to those people. Seems like both group are pretty small but are armed with some guns and have ""connections within"" the RMCP as one post is a member posing next to a RCMP suv with an AK rifle. Both groups have posts that have nazi symbolism in them. 

I could not find anything else on them.

The ""Aryan rad fem unity"" account seems related to the whole Exdous Cry group, since they have photos of members wearing a t shirt from that ""trafficking hub"" thing. The daily beast exposed the group behind that campaign of being related to a radical religious sect in that is fiercely anti-abortion, anti-LGBT and anti-sex work. They helped put money into an anti-LGBT law in Kenya as someone pointed out on twitter. Someone who i talked to about this last night said that the group was probably some christian extremists like the army of god that targeted and killed abortion doctors.

"Is it wrong to portray women in idealized, sexual ways?","Yesterday there was a pretty popular thread on r/Art with a painting of an Asian girl in her bra drinking her morning coffee. It was a very good painting in terms of technical skill but the subject matter seemed to revolt some people. They started pointing out details like they wouldn't wear a push-up bra in the morning and stuff like that. One redditor called it a ""male gaze"", which I didn't even know what it was at the time but she defined it in a later comment as a ""made for the viewing pleasure of heterosexual males"" and went ahead to point out that real-life women don't look like that. I'll go ahead and post my response:


&gt;Art would be boring if it was all realistic. Have you noticed how in Da Vinci's Last Supper painting, everyone sits on one side of the table, even though it would be a lot more convenient to use both sides? Da Vinci painted an idealized version where all the disciples are displayed in a row so that they will all be visible to the viewer. It's illogical from a pragmatic standpoint but it makes the painting better.

&gt;In the same vein, I don't think there's anything wrong with an exaggerated, illogical and vaguely sexual depiction of a girl drinking coffee, just as I don't find anything wrong with a statue of naked muscle-hunk Hercules chocking Cerberus and saying ""I am tough and good in bed""


She responded that this sexualized depiction of women causes misogynistic attitudes and human trafficking. I'll be honest, I didn't understand that at all. Why is it that the sexual depiction of women immediately alludes to rape and sex trafficking? Cannot women just be flirty and promiscuous because they want to? Why is it that if I draw an unrealistically handsome guy with a seductive gaze, he is just a seductive guy, whereas if I draw an idealized seductive girl, she is a dehumanized sex object. I see no reason to attach such a dark context to a painting.


As for it being unrealistic, yes it is, but maybe that's not such a crime. A realistic depiction of a man in the morning would be with tousled hair, eye boogers and drool. Will women develop unrealistic standards if they keep seeing male Calvin Klein models who supposedly just woke up but they look like they just exited a makeup studio? I don't think people are that stupid, both men and women can tell apart reality from fantasy. If you watch Game of Thrones you won't be attracted to dragon-slaying men only, if you watch superhero films you won't be attracted to superheroes only and if you watch anime you won't be attracted to big-eyed people only.


What are your thoughts? My post got a little ranty but I'm not trying to be patronizing or change your views on anything, I just want to see what I've been missing.

I had no idea these websites existed until I stumbled upon them when I googled myself. There are 1000s of people who are doxxed on there and the poster can say whatever they want, anonymously, without any legal repercussions (that I‚Äôm aware of). 

I was just wondering if any of you have had an experience of being doxxed on one of these websites, and if there is anything that can be done to take them down and hold the poster accountable.

How to handle media that seems to objectify women?,"I'm still learning how to articulate my thoughts on this so please share your perspectives!

I'm bothered how pervasive it is in media and I don't want to feel so resentful about it. People tell me, ""then don't watch it."" But I can't just avoid media, because it's like I'm turning a blind eye and not addressing my gripes with it. I want to know how to change my .. mindset I guess?

Should I (24M) eventually confess the worst thing I've done to any prospective partners?,"I'm currently single, and I've done some things about which I have great guilt. They may be considered criminal, but no one involved seems to care, and it's not like I'm expecting to ever have the police at my door because of these things.

Should I still tell any future partners about these things? I'm especially concerned that any of my partners should be provided with full transparency about who their sleeping with, so as not to deceive them into sex or a relationship (it just feels rapey). This may just be my anxiety talking, so feel free, anyone, to tell me so.

TL;DR! I've done some terrible things, but I'm not expecting any real consequences from them, and don't want to deceive any future partners into sex or relationships by not confessing these things.

EDIT: Thank you all for this input! I think the general idea is simple enough: if, in theory, my partner were to somehow learn about something I did and be put off by it, then I should disclose it at an appropriate time, no matter how slim a chance there may be. The reason being that healthy relationships are based on the ability to be honest and thus vulnerable about the good and bad parts of yourself with the other person.

Who is responsible Commercialization and Commodification of Women,"Women showing off their sexuality of their own volition and profiting from it if they wish is a sign of feminine empowerment, not objectification. 

That said, I definitely understand where many are coming from. Sexualization of women in contexts where it doesn‚Äôt really have anything to do with the main content is typically just disingenuous eye candy, lazy marketing designed to attract impulse buyers who only need to see a pretty face to get interested.

It‚Äôs rather complicated, because those women are excercising their right to profit off their sexuality, and those customers are buying exactly what those women are offering. They aren‚Äôt being exploited or coerced into giving more.

But then this perpetuates the mentality that women ARE commodities, which may lead those men to hurt real women who AREN‚ÄôT interested in selling their sexuality. But who‚Äôs responsibility is it to fix this? Capitalism? The Government? Women? Men?",1
What do you think about pre-college single-sex schools?,"I am a student who has studied in private all boys schools since elementary school. I am now a high school senior.

On the one hand, comparing to what I hear from my cousin and friends, there are no ""drama"" in an all boys' school. Gossips are really rare and there are no who's dating who going on at all. We also feel completely comfortable participating in activities having a traditionally skewed gender ratio, for example, I am very proud of being a member of the school's choir, while my friend in a co-ed school says they have real trouble recruiting boys into mixed choirs.

On the other hand, we lack the opportunity to learn what boundaries are, especially when it comes to interacting with the opposite sex. On rare occasions where the school organize activities with a sister school, most of us just sit together among ourselves and do not actively try to make new friends from the other school (same for the girls) as communication often becomes awkward and nervous. Another thing I notice is among us boys, when we know no female can hear us, we would laugh on sex and porn jokes that would probably make women offended or uncomfortable.

Why is sexual assault depicted in so many TV shows/Movies?,"I want to preface this by admitting that I am heavily triggered by topics surrounding sexual assault and harassment so I may just be overestimating but at least four of the shows I‚Äôve tried to watch have depicted SA in some way. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I literally feel the need to google search a show‚Äôs name and put ‚Äúrape‚Äù after it to see what comes up.

I think I‚Äôd feel so much differently about this if these depictions were done in ways that were focused on the survivor and their journey navigating the aftermath of the assault (I think the show ‚ÄúI May Destroy You‚Äù by Michaela Coel did a pretty good job at this). But often it feels like the scenes are just a way to advance the plot, show how ‚Äúevil‚Äù someone or something is and/or a way to add ‚Äúdepth‚Äù or backstory to a female character. 

While I recognize that depictions of sexual assault in media can start very necessary conversations about rape culture and how to recognize it, I feel like a lot of the shows I see are not doing it for that purpose. Am I being too critical?",1
"Please help me understand emotional labor, I think my thoughts are misogynistic","I've been reading about women's emotional labor and I can't stop thinking that the problem is being incompatible. I realize that there is definitely an imbalance due to socializing which is sexist but if you can't find a solution that works for everyone and your partner doesn't care about your feelings, then that just sounds like a bad relationship to me. So I understand that the cause is sexist and harmful but I don't see how and why it's so difficult to resolve if your partner is not awful. 
I'm a woman who is terrible at and disinterested in household stuff. Fortunately, my partner loves to cook and decorate so he does all of that. We take turns with every other chore.

"Can one be a feminist if they don't ever use the term ""Latinx""?","This kind of irks at me inside because I just can't get comfortable with the term. Largely due to that I don't know a single person who identifies with it, but do know multiple Latino/a people who consider the term at best silly and eye-rollworthy and at worse offensive. It's also unpronouncable in Spanish and it feels uncomfortable to effectively tell Spanish speakers ""Your language is so dated and patriarchial, let us Anglophones tell you how to update it..."", this wouldn't be so much of an issue if most or at least a significant minority of Spanish speakers were open to the term, but every poll has shown that at most like 2-3% of Latinos in the US identify with it. I simply am not comfortable using the word especially when discussing demographic makeups which I do regularly discussing political geography (like saying a certain county is ""X% Latinx"" instead of ""X% Latino"" which is the standard.

I don't have as much antipathy toward it as I do the term ""womxn"" which I actually find flat out offensive and will always call out if I see it used on Twitter or whatnot, but it's not a word I can ever see myself using, though I still consider myself very progressive and feminist.

"Are these articles right or wrong in their claims, and if wrong, can you explain why that is?","As a woman, I don't understand why twitter is full of women talking about ""women naturally desiring strong men"" followed by bashing on ""feminine"" men?: [https://twitter.com/BritMartinez/status/1345522717789978626](https://twitter.com/BritMartinez/status/1345522717789978626)

The article linked sounds more off-putting to me: [https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/feminization-men-cheats-women-natural-desire-to-admire-strong-men/?fbclid=IwAR2popTJ9BBAiWkL8FNfLMjc81fMPQFnTFoBVgfYokrIHeGJ5LmaNs8MDto](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/feminization-men-cheats-women-natural-desire-to-admire-strong-men/?fbclid=IwAR2popTJ9BBAiWkL8FNfLMjc81fMPQFnTFoBVgfYokrIHeGJ5LmaNs8MDto)

In summary, the article mentions the Yin and Yang, claiming that women are innately ""feminine"", and men innately ""masculine"", that the ""feminine"" (woman) naturally desires and needs the ""masculine"" (man) to be complete (for ""femininity/womanhood"" to be fulfilled) just as much as the ""masculine"" (man) naturally desires and needs the ""feminine"" (woman) to be complete (for ""masculinity/manhood"" to be fulfilled)

""One can‚Äôt fulfill itself without the other"" it says. Indeed the Yin and Yang claims that all things exist as inseparable and contradictory opposites, which I'm guessing leads to the belief that: ""women are innately feminine, men are innately masculine, men can not be feminine, and women can not be masculine, or that would defy nature. And men (masculine) can not love or be in relationships with men (masculine), and women (feminine) can not love or be in relationships with women (feminine), because only the polar opposites can fulfill and complete each other, masculine (man) can not complement and complete the masculine (man), and feminine (woman) can not complement and complete the feminine (woman)""

&gt;The masculine needs the feminine just as much as the feminine needs the masculine. It‚Äôs an eternal truth as old as the concept of Yin and Yang itself. Tragically, today, we‚Äôre witnessing the extensive snuffing out of the masculine in our society. The Yang is being suppressed. When the modern feminists proclaim that gender is just a made-up ‚Äúconstruct,‚Äù understand that they‚Äôre essentially belittling the eons of human experience. The masculine-feminine duality isn‚Äôt a tool that the patriarchy uses to oppress women, despite what these anti-gender-roles activists allege. Rather, it‚Äôs an everlasting concept present in all of mankind, whether it be Eastern or Western or Native traditions.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Yin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity, and night time. Yang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity, and daytime. One can‚Äôt overrule the other. Womanhood and manhood have to work in tandem. It‚Äôs a symbol of the continuity of life itself.¬†

It links to another article when it reaches ""have to work in tandem"": [https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/men-and-women-are-complementary-this-benefits-couples-and-their-children/](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/men-and-women-are-complementary-this-benefits-couples-and-their-children/)

&gt;Men and women are unique beings created to complement each other. Biological differences enable men and women to live in love and harmony, forming a beautiful whole when they come together.

The rest is bashing ""feminine"" men, and saying that ""femininity"" comes with ""irrationality"" so men shouldn't be ""feminized"" because if they were to be so, they would become ""irrational"", basing their decisions on emotions ...

I'm not well-versed in these subjects, and thought I'd reach out to other women here who might know more.

Do you think those articles are right or wrong? And if they are wrong, can you explain your reasons?

Do you have any arguments against the things said in those articles?

I felt really terrible reading those articles because they sound misogynistic and homophobic? They seem to tell me that as a lesbian I am ""incomplete"" or a failure, because ""woman (feminine) can only be completed by a man (masculine), and vice versa""

I don't know, it's like all the homophobic things I've been told and I feel a bit sick :((",1

"Women with a better-than-average career/salary, are you repelled by men who have a lower social status/less money/a less ""blooming"" career than yourself? Do you always prefer men with an equal/higher social status?","Female hypergamy is sometimes said to be a social norm. The biggest stereotype is ""men are providers"", and ""a man must have his mission"" (you often hear that from dating coach and all sorts of gurus).

Evolutionary psychology sort of says that hypergamy makes sense (females prefer males who can feed their offsprings), but I'm still curious so I come to ask here. It's also important to remember that modern humans are not limited by natural laws (we got out of the food chain, food and shelter are more abundant, etc), so hypergamy should ""go away"" in modern civilization.

In a way, historically, if men had a higher social status than women, hypergamy might be still be correlation, not causation; meaning: an average woman preferring an average man, will mean that the man will still have a higher social status, but social status is not a factor, it's just because of a preexisting distribution of social status between men and women.

It's not a secret that social status and money cannot really determine how two people can be attracted to each other, since it depends on other things: a higher social status might also come from a better education, more love from their parents, a more stable social situation, more nurturing, etc.

When talking about how women are ""catching up"", It's often said that it's easier to automate jobs that are worked in majority by men, compared to job who are in majority worked by women (it's just a theory though).

Make up my own last name?,"Hey everyone. So something that‚Äôs never sat right with me is taking a mans last name. Considering that to him, the idea of taking the woman he loves last name is unfathomable, so why should it be fathomable for me to take his? There‚Äôs a (sorta) simple solution here, and that is to just not take his last name and to keep the one that was given to me at birth, my fathers last name; however, that‚Äôs still a bit unsettling to me lol. 

My father has been emotionally abusive to me ever since I was little, and recently I‚Äôve decided to completely cut him out of my life. He is all things I never want to be‚Äîan abuser, manipulator, narcissist, racists, sexist, homophobic‚Äîeverything bigot. Plus, there‚Äôs not much notability in having my family name in general. The previous generations did not accomplish much and rather just passed on their trauma to the next which ultimately led to me and how I feel about my dad (in other words, they weren‚Äôt/aren‚Äôt great people). Basically, I don‚Äôt feel much honor keeping my dads family last name. 

I‚Äôm a first generation college student about to graduate next year and am going to medical school. The more I think about my dads last name being on my diploma and doctorate degree makes me more and more sick, honestly. I don‚Äôt have any desire bringing honor to a family that has dishonored me so incredibly. For a year, I‚Äôve been thinking about coming up with my own meaningful last name and changing it from my family last name. Has anyone ever done this? Or should I keep my dads last name because it is technically still my last name? The other issue is that since I have been thinking about it for a year, no name I‚Äôve come across has lit the light bulb. 

I could take my moms last name, but it‚Äôs STILL A MANS LAST NAME!! I want to make my OWN last name. Why can‚Äôt my children take my last name? Why can‚Äôt my own name be on my own academic achievements? Idk lol I need opinions.",1

"Thoughts about the gatekeeping of surgical sterilization (tubal ligation, etc.)?","Hi all, I've just been pondering this issue in my head for a few weeks now and I thought I'd bring it here just to see your thoughts.

Most of us have probably heard plenty of accounts from women who have sought out surgical sterilization and been told ""what if your husband someday wants children?"", ""only if you have kids already"", ""only if you're above a certain age"" etc., etc., etc.

It goes without saying that I don't think that's right.

At the same time I realize that, in general (i.e. with regard to *all* procedures, not just sterilization), doctors may feel an ethical responsibility (or maybe have an actual legal, written-in-stone responsibility ... I don't know) to steer patients toward the procedure that is least invasive, and/or which is least restrictive to the patient's future freedom of choice, if there is such an option and it is at least adequate relative to the more invasive/permanent one.

On one hand I do believe the amount of agency a patient has over their body should be maximized, and like the rest of you I believe that this is especially important with regard to reproductive autonomy. I think it's patronizing and disrespectful to act like you know better what a patient wants out of life than they do (unless there is some unusual factor, like the patient is experiencing mental health issues and abruptly starts expressing strong desires that are in contradiction to the ideals they consistently expressed when they were in better health).

A hypothetical: From what I understand, the failure rate of a hormonal IUD (3 in 1000) is about equivalent to the failure rate of tubal ligation (sources I'm reading seem to say between 1 in 1000 to 8 in 1000). Say you're a doctor and you have a patient *with no interfering health issues that would contraindicate a hormonal IUD*, but they come to you and seem to have their mind set on a tubal ligation. They have thought about it for a long time and express complete certainty that they will not want biological children in the future. 

You believe that a hormonal IUD would be just as adequate to serve the patient's purposes as a tubal ligation, and you feel a responsibility to choose the most conservative (as in low-risk, reversible etc.) adequate procedure wherever possible. You tell the patient that a hormonal IUD is about equal in reliability to tubal ligation, and they accept this, but this does not change their mind. The patient tells you that the more permanent procedure *feels* more effective and would grant them peace of mind (I have read accounts from people who desire surgery over an IUD for exactly this reason).

How could a doctor appropriately address this situation?

I understand that tubal ligation is reversible, but this is of course more invasive and I would imagine that, as a surgical procedure done under anaesthesia, it is significantly higher-risk than IUD removal (I don't know if it is, I'm just making an educated guess).

I don't think it's ever right to tell a patient who says they don't want children ""you'll probably change your mind someday"" or ""your husband might want children"" (gross), etc.. At the same time, people *do* change their minds about this unexpectedly for all sorts of reasons, and if a person *does* happen to change their mind, I would imagine that having to undergo the surgical reversal of a sterilization (which, as I understand it, is a complicated procedure you can't guarantee the success of) would cause significantly more distress than an IUD removal. 

In effect, one exercise of reproductive autonomy (in choosing surgical sterilization) poses a threat to the patient's future *ability* to make different choices. At the same time I acknowledge that the future limitation was accepted by the patient at the time of their initial choice, which makes it different from the limitation of choice *imposed* when doctors refuse to perform surgical sterilizations on (mostly women, of course) patients who don't meet X, Y, and Z standards.

How can this be accounted for while, at the same time, maximizing patients' bodily and medical autonomy? You could say that it is ultimately the patient's responsibility to account for the potential consequences of the choice they're making, but I could see where this line of thought could set a dangerous precedent in medical ethics (especially with regard to other elective procedures) unless it was articulated very carefully.

Bear in mind that I don't have much formal knowledge about medical ethics and I don't know what conventions and protocols might already be in place to address this issue.

I haven't come to much of a conclusion in my consideration of this issue, so I'd like to hear your thoughts. Thanks for reading and I hope I've articulated this well.",1

Do you look down on people who are unfazed or even flattered by unsolicited sexual acts from others?,"If you notice a stranger walking up to someone and make lewd comments to them, **but** that person seems to enjoy the attention, do you think ""they must be damaged if they enjoy this attention"", or ""if they enjoyed it then they enjoyed it; to each their own""?

For instance in social environments I've had my ass grabbed as a joke unprompted by friends and acquaintances of both genders (without prior recognition of consent between us), and I have mostly felt either unfazed, flattered or in some cases I even find it funny. One of my closer friends has witnessed this and told me that ""something is wrong with me"" if I don't think they're creeps or bad people for doing that to me, and even worse, that I must have had a traumatic experience which conditioned me to be okay with this. And I think that this is a rather invalidating thing to say.

Now, only people I know personally have done that to me. Strangers have never done that, and in that case I would feel violated. But obviously there exists people out there who enjoy that unprompted behavior even from strangers. And there are people who would condone much more than an unprompted ass slap or someone making sexual comments. Do you think these people are ""damaged""  or do you think of it more as ""you do you""?

And keep in mind I'm NOT asking what you think of the people doing these things (""perpetrators""), so this discussion isn't about that. I'm well aware of the idea that they are still problematic even if the other person doesn't mind. Right now I'm focusing entirely on the people to whom the ""perpetrators"" are doing these unsolicited sexual acts, rather than the perpetrators themselves.",1

Fetishizing gay people of any gender is wrong, yet there's this weird acceptance with straight women fetishizing gay men in society.

There's one argument that I've heard which is that straight erotica is usually centered around straight men and not women, so women use MLM erotica...but isnt that just trying to justify fetishization? Why not just make separate erotica centered around straight women than having to fetishize gay/bi men as a result.

Serious question from a guy who‚Äôs from a mixed race family about his little sister.,"Hey people, so I never thought I would find myself on a feminist page as I‚Äôm not very political but I have a genuine question concerning my little sister. 

My family is biracial and I look very white like my mother but my sister is dark skinned. Well recently she started dating this guy and when talking to my female friend she made the comment ‚Äúof course your sister had to date the only black guy in school.‚Äù 

The comment seemed innocent but it really rubbed me the wrong way. I have heard other comments such as ‚Äúguess she wanted to be with one of her own‚Äù. These are really bothering me because I have grown up with my sister and I know for fact that she chose the man she‚Äôs with because he‚Äôs an awesome guy and when I see them interacting he really knows how to connect with her. She didn‚Äôt choose him because he looked like her, my sister is a deep and intuitive person. 

I guess now that I‚Äôm older I‚Äôm having to confront the fact that society sees her and her decisions as that of a ‚Äúblack girl‚Äù and not as her own. 

How can I be there for her and what is a good way to respond to these ridiculous statements so I can defend my little sister. 

I love her and I hate seeing the box society tries to put her decisions into. Idk, I know this a long rant/question but I‚Äôm at a loss here. 

I grew up with her and now that she‚Äôs older I hate seeing people assume she‚Äôs a certain way because she‚Äôs a woman or because she‚Äôs black or both and If anyone here has seen or experienced the same thing, what are some good ways to shut down negative comments and ignorance without accusing the other of intentionally being rude/mean.",1

'Yeah but actually...' from Men when talking about sexual abuse of children (Trigger Warning!!!),"I think I need help here. 

Recently I have listened to the podcast 'Lolita' (tw: child sexual abuse, rape, grooming, violence) that discusses the original text of the book by Nabokov and how pop culture somehow twisted it into this forbidden love story and often frames Dolores as the seductress that knew what she wanted and so on.

I talked to my friends about it to get their opinion on it, and what just stands out to me is that every woman just simply agrees that an adult man and a child of 12 can not have a sexual and romantic relationship and that there's basically no grey area, neither in the book (that gives us the narrative of a pedophile who frames the grooming of a child in a certain light to sound less incriminating) nor in real life. It's abuse, it's rape, it's not morally debatable even if the child would later say (which Dolores did not!) that she has not been coerced etc

Now, a significant number of the men I talked to (3 out of 5 to be precise), all of whom I consider great people and all self-identified feminists, agreed overall, but started to do the whole 'yeah but' thing. Yeah but what did she feel, maybe she was alright with it, yeah but if she was slightly older, yeah but what if she was mature for her age etc.. In common they had that there seemed to be this assumption that, theoretically, a child could consent if the stars aligned or whatever. Now, I don't know how many 12 year olds people have been around, but honestly, am I just completely wrong here when I say that HARD NO, a 12 year old, even if they themselves at the time believe that it was consensual (something that I personally have never even heard of, and seems to be a rather absurd hypothetical situation in lights of the thousands and thousands of child abuse cases), CAN NOT give informed consent to sex with an adult, never mind to a relationship?

There has even been an instance where I wasn't even sure what we were talking about anymore or what exactly he was saying, just that there was a need for a 'but' there that just wouldn't go away.

I'm not sure if I just am very very biased, coming from a position of a woman who has been sexually harassed by a much, much older man that I trusted when I was 14, and from the position of a therapist who sees so many women who have gone through sexual abuse by an adult when they were kids. Maybe I'm not seeing the 'but' here. 

So yeah, I guess what I'm asking for is: have you made similar experiences with men on this topic and if yes, why do you think that is? Also, if you think I'm too undifferentiated and need to consider a different angle that I'm just not seeing, feel free to point it out.

Feminism &amp; Sexism activists in my social media bubble,"Update

Since I won't check reddit much more this evening: Thank you all so much for your responses and perspectives. I was searching for a place where I can have a healthy conversation about this topic and my feelings right now. My wife and I talked so much the last hours, but in the end, we have a similar idea about it, since we spent the last years together and gathered the same experiences. 

This here helped me a lot to get a better view for the bigger picture. I am more aware of my responsibility in my privileged life. 

Therefore: You people are amazing &lt;3 hope you get well, healthy and happy into 2021!



Original Post:

Hello everyone,

I hope this is the right subredit for this. In case not, feel free to advice me another one more suitable :) thank you

I really need your help on this. I was thinking about this all night long.

This is a very special and difficult topic for me. I use a throwaway account since I am highly insecure when it comes to the correct phrasing and possible negative reactions. Moreover, English isn‚Äôt my primary language, so apologize for grammar or spelling mistakes.

**tl;dr: Within my social media bubble, I get increasingly hurt by messages (mostly tweets) that are phrased very radically. There is no way to have a healthy and constructive conversation, since I am a man and therefore ‚Äúmansplaining‚Äù. By now I tend to think that I should accept this, swallow my hurt feelings and accept, that the overall topic is so important, that my hurt feelings less important.**

I am a man in my early thirties, and I am CEO of a company in social media marketing (thus making this topic extra important but also extra explosive). I am also married to a wonderful wife and we have a 3-year-old son. We are a couple for almost 14 years now and know each other for 17 years.

The reason I mention this is that in both roles of my life, I am trying to regularly reflect on my decisions and my own thoughts. On whether there is some underlying aspect of sexism, leading me to certain impressions or ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù decisions. I have the luxury of having a wife and colleagues who let me discuss this topic and therefore evaluate the situations. Sexism, like many other topics in our society, are moving an evolving which is why I think it is important to talk and discuss about them continuously. In my opinion, this is the foundation of change: A healthy, inviting and constructive atmosphere in order to discuss and evolve.

Switching over to my actual topic: My social media bubble is currently filled with mostly women who bring up the topic of feminism and sexism. Bringing these topics to the frontline of social discussion is important and I support it as much as I can with retweets and comments and shares among my friends.

At the same time, I see more and more posts that I agree with in their essence, but not in their phrasing. Just one example (rephrased the original tweet to make an easier example):

**‚ÄúOMG men in relations who flirt with other women are so disgusting. They should learn to treat their girlfriends with respect. Girls, get up and fight!‚Äù**

Tweets like this provoke a huge social media feedback and therefore reach.

Lying and betraying a partner (or any human) is bad. I agree. And women should stand up to such a behavior. But this isn‚Äôt the message of this tweet.

My wife and I are fine with the other person flirting with others. We openly talk about sexual desires and boundaries. So while the intention of this tweet is fine, I am put in the same box with people with bad intent. There are multiple tweets that go in the same direction.

I tried to reason with the person tweeting this per DM. I said that its not about the idea and message but about the phrasing that should be differentiated, since not all men are acting like this.

The response was, a link to this article plus a big text about why it was presumptuous to message her about her tweet, since she is an activist in this topic and way better informed and educated than I probably am.

[https://medium.com/@KirstyStricklan/why-men-should-stop-saying-notallmen-immediately-f657e244f7a1](https://medium.com/@KirstyStricklan/why-men-should-stop-saying-notallmen-immediately-f657e244f7a1)

I pulled back asap, apologized for the impression I made, thanked her long message (she explained her backstory) and wished her a good evening.

I agree, that it was presumptuous to confront her with my opinion, without her asking. Additionally, even though I think her reaction was highly defensive and destructive for every healthy discussion, she probably usually has discussions like this in a way more hostile environment, leading to her always having her defense up and running for every man ‚Äúattacking‚Äù her.

But in the end, I had another two thoughts:

1. I learned that in topics like racism, sexism aso. it isn‚Äôt about the senders intent, but about how it is received. This is why, when someone confronts one with something that might be received sexist or racist, one should (constructively) converse (especially when it is clear, that there was no bad intent), reflect and adjust ones thinking and acting.However, in the current case, I am not allowed to be the receiver who is hurt by this message. On the contrary. An article like the one above tells me, the receiver, that I am wrong. And the digital society even created the word ‚Äúmansplaining‚Äù, to not only take away my right to feel hurt, but to actively make it something bad.
2. As stated in my tl;dr: I don‚Äôt define myself by this stuff on social media. I can be hurt but it won‚Äôt affect me that much. As mentioned, tweets like the one above create a high reach by high interaction rates and therefore push the topic of feminism more and more in the spotlight. Based on the phrase ‚Äúthe end justifies the means‚Äù, I would currently tend to accepting that feminism and sexism currently is no topic I can participate in, but that the current dynamic will create awareness for the topic ‚Äì even if it is by creating insecurity

There are many more thoughts and layers I have with this topic but this would make this thread even longer and more confusing.

I would like to have your thoughts on this. Do you make similar experiences on social media? Should I act differently? In all honesty: I really want to learn and understand. And I can do that best by conversing with others.

Thank you very much for your time an effort. It is much appreciated &lt;3",1

Should affirmative action in Australia be rolled back in light of the findings of the 2016 Australian Beta report?,"The prominent feminist narrative that I often hear about is that women are being turned away from job opportunities particularly by men. So apparently, the Australian government in 2016 to simultaneously expose and rectify this problem with nameless resumes. By using nameless resumes and making the recruitment process completely gender-blind, they wanted to ensure that hiring outcomes will be more equitable and that women will no longer have to be judged by anything else other than their merit. They ran a trial to examine the results and found that:

*""The trial found assigning a male name to a candidate made them 3.2 per cent less likely to get a job interview.*

*Adding a woman's name to a CV made the candidate 2.9 per cent more likely to get a foot in the door.""*

Apparently making the recruitment process fair and impartial leads to less women being hired than before.

The report just redefines this information that shows discrimination towards men as evidence that affirmative action is working and recommends keeping names on resumes.

*Overall, the results indicate the need for caution when moving towards ‚Äôblind‚Äô recruitment processes in the APS, as de-identification may frustrate efforts aimed at promoting diversity.*

But since it's quite obvious that what the report inadvertently just demonstrated is that affirmative action in Australia is indistinguishable from discrimination, should affirmative action be rolled back so that hiring outcomes aren't biased towards women?

Thoughts on Perrault's Bluebeard,"Hi r/Feminism,

Bluebeard by Charles Perrault is my very favourite fairy tale. If you don't know it, here is the [wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebeard) to it. Considering most fairy tales, Bluebeard could be termed a 'feminist' (before the term existed) tale of a woman who kills (!) and escapes from her male oppressor.

&gt;While some scholars interpret the Bluebeard story as a fable preaching obedience to wives (as [Perrault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Perrault)'s moral suggests), [folklorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklorist) [Maria Tatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Tatar) has suggested that the tale encourages women not to unquestioningly follow patriarchal rules. Women breaking men's rules in the fairy tale can be seen as a metaphor for women breaking society's rules and being punished for their transgression.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebeard#cite_note-12) The key can be seen as a sign of disobedience or transgression; it can also be seen as a sign that one should not trust their husband.

If you have come across this tale previously (or just now through this post) what are your thoughts on the tale? Do you know other fairy tales/myths which give the female protagonist agency &amp; power?

EDIT: It's *really* surprising that Bluebeard has never been made into a Disney film.",1

"What should be the response to those anti-feminists who spread the ""lying about rape and the man facing charges"" posts, who dont care bout them at all and are just using these posts to attack feminists and women? And saying we have ""women privileges""?","I am really confused here, so please if I say something wrong, forgive me.I see a lot of ""women lied about rape and now the man is facing charges for life"" and similar to those posts around social media, and don't get me wrong, it is bad and no one should ever do that. But these posts are spread around by anti-feminists, they dont care about that person at all, its just an attack. And people even believe the fake news they spread about these type of posts. I checked a lot of posts like these and most of them turns out to be fake. And people believe them. Further blindly agreeing with the anti feminists and saying that women have more privileges than men. It always confuses me. And what does more is that they say how it ruins the man's life and yeah they are right. But as a survivor of rape myself, it makes me mad and I know that is wrong. I think how most of the women never even report. And the ones that do, they dont really have a life after that. They will be called liars and whatnot for the rest of their lives. And the trauma it will leave... And how only just a few ever get justice and can live without much problems and thats good. And the male rape victims...they face the same stuff too coz of how men are not raped and those beliefs... So I just needed to know what would be the best way to tell people.

 If this post is confusing or anything, please let me know I will delete it. I dont think I even asked a valid question or something like that. Sorry. (Please moderators, kf this post was not enough or didnt make sense or anything like that, please dont block me, just tell me I will delete it)",1
How would the world change if clothing and beauty products didn't exist?,"This question is a bit out there so please forgive me.

Imagine you wake up tomorrow to find that all the clothing, beauty products, and other adornments have disappeared from the world, never to be remade. Instead of applying makeup in the morning, billions of women to out into the world baring the face they woke up with no matter the situation. Instead of putting together outfits for the day, we live our lives in bare feet and unclothed bodies, lacking jewelry or hair products as well.

Aside from having to deal with cold weather (just pretend everyone adapts to this), how would society change? How would the world react to these changes, and how would you deal with them personally?",1
Antifeminist analogy analysis,"I‚Äôve been talking with this guy about feminism. He‚Äôs a antifeminist (aka a bigot).

He sent me this analogy for feminism whenever i said that feminism does support mens issues.

‚ÄúIt's the classic motte and bailey tactic (medieval castle analogy).
The bailey is the part of the castle where most of the actual work is done. It's several acres, filled with people working at various tasks--weaving, brewing, blacksmithing, tending livestock, etc. There will be a wall around it, but because of the large circumference of the perimeter, it is hard to defend.
The motte is a tower, set on high ground, with strong fortifications that can resist attack.
When enemies arrive, the people in the bailey retreat to the safety of the motte.
Feminists, while in the bailey, perform the work of producing and pushing anti-male ideas. These ideas are hard to defend.
Then the enemy arrives, and points to what's going on in the feminist bailey.
At which point, all the feminists in the bailey retreat to the motte and start shouting the easier to defend idea that, ""feminism is just about gender equality! Look it up in the dictionary! Pay no attention to what people were doing in the bailey--those people aren't even real feminists!""
Black Lives Matter use this ploy, too. Their bailey is filled with anti-capitalism, a plainly stated intent to ""disrupt"" the allegedly white supremacist ""nuclear family structure"", demands to abolish the police, and other extremely radical and difficult to defend ideas.
When anyone calls them on the above, they retreat to their motte, wherein they characterize the criticism as a rejection of the defensible (and pretty much universally agreed upon) idea that black lives matter as much as white lives.
It's rhetorical chicanery, but it works on low-information people.‚Äù

What do we all think?",1

Financial independence of homemakers,"I come from a conservative developing country where the major feminist issues are domestic violence and economical emancipation of women. So the idea of an adult without any independent source of income (may it be via employment or social welfare) seems scary to me.

Are there measures in place to help with homemakers' financial independence (while in the relationship not after a divorce)?",1
Should lookism/desirability politics be taken more seriously as its own intersection? Should we consider ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù the way we consider other privileges?,"I have ofc seen these concepts discussed, yet not as heavily as other intersections.  Attraction bias, as well, isn‚Äôt considered a social justice issue in the way other biases/prejudices are.  Should it really be normalized to call people ‚Äúugly‚Äù as an insult, whether or not a person is problematic or a member of another privileged group?

Beauty standards are mostly discussed within the contexts of racism/Eurocentricity and misogyny.  I personally feel reducing it to those alone is an oversimplification (because members of privileged groups can *not* fit certain beauty standards and be subject to attraction biases), hence my question on recognizing it as it‚Äôs own intersection.

Edit:  I think to narrow such a broad discussion, we could discuss if shaming people for being ‚Äúugly‚Äù should be condemned just as much as say, body shaming someone.  Or why judging people by looks is normalized and should it continue to be? There seems to be good discussion already on the consequences of such judgement, and how severe they are.",1
Why are children always named after men?,"I've noticed how common it is for sons to be named after fathers, grandfathers, and other notable people in their family.

Should all social media have stricter verification?,"With all the Pornhub controversy going on, I thought this would be an interesting discussion to start.

It seems like a lot of the media focuses mostly on porn websites when there are much higher numbers of child sexual abuse content being posted on Facebook and other social media (Facebook has close to 100 million cases, and Pornhub had around 100 before they deleted all unverified content). Even on GoneWild subreddits I find myself wondering if some of the women (and other genders to a lesser extent) are even over 18, since this site doesn't require age verification. After seeing how Pornhub made the change to verification as a requirement, it made me think about how other platforms can implement this too. All sex worker platforms such as OnlyFans and ManyVids already required this, but why not apply it to general social media because of how many people lie about their age and all?

I feel like this wouldn't cause too much backlash either; I know Tinder currently has optional face verification but most people don't mind going through with it because of how simple the process is. Some people might have trust issues in regards to showing ID though, so I can see that being a problem.

However I'd love to hear what you guys think, and it's relevant to gender inequality because of how often the victims of these issues are young girls.",1
Does feminism really need Hollywood and A-list celebrities?,"I'm trying to read the signs and it seems to me that Hollywood and celebrities on the whole are losing relevance every year. It seems to be a clear trend.

Throughout the 2010's I've certainly seen more movies that tried to include feminism and more diverse representation but the format feels super old. The messages and ideas, okay sometimes but often very dumbed down and chronically behind discussions going on in social media. A lot of the time it feels like they are chasing ghosts, address problems to a show that's actually mostly dead already. Do gender switched remake movies even matter at all? 

I got concerned about how there's this new Wonder Woman movie which includes a man who's body is invaded by the spirit of WW's dead boyfriend and used for sex. So clearly, yet another wannabe progressive blockbuster that pollutes it's own intentions through glaring incompetence.

But then I thought, how many will even watch this movie? How many of those watching will do so without simultaneously fidgeting with their phones?  Superhero movies and nostalgia-trains seem to still have some hold on the Gen-X audience, but that interest is waning fast too. Nothing much else is being created.  

As for celebrities, it seems less and less people care or even listens to what they have to say anymore. Not in the pandemic, that's for sure. It's evident when we see how a couple of virologists over the world now enjoy positions as superstars. Something that couldn't happen in the past when that spotlight was reserved for actors. 

My question is, does it even matter? Does the death of movie mass entertainment and that collective culture impact feminism in any way? If so, is it in a good or bad way?",1

"My girlfriend is sexist, what can I do?","Me (27m)  and my girlfriend (26f) have been together for almost a year now, but recently something about her world view has started to cause conflict. My grlfriend is a Ukrainian immigrant who was raised in an extremely religiously conservative family and community with strict gender roles. As and teenager and an adult, she got away from it, moved on an evolved her perspective. The problem is, when it comes to issues of gender, it became uneven. What I mean by that is she doesn't apply traditional gender roles to men, really at all, and is incredibly progressive in that sense, but she still applies strong gender roles to women. She doesn't openly hate women, but deep down I know she is conflicted over some of those ideas that were taught to her, and it corrupts her judgment and leads to prejudice and at times self hatred.

 The majority of her friends are male, and she while she usually says that's just because she gets along with them better in general, she has admitted to be at times that it's because she doesn't usually trust women, even with female friends she has, she very obviously doesn't open up to them as much. She is also very quick to assume the worst of women in general, whereas she tends to give men the benefit of the doubt, and makes excuses for their behavior, something she basically never does with her women friends. Although she never admits it, I've noticed she doesn't like going to professionals who are women, I've seen her avoid female doctors, driver instructors, and lawyers. Although she has a sexually progressive outlook in theory, and is against marriage for personal reasons, I've frequently caught her slut shaming other women, and even herself. She's admitted to me before that she feels bad about having a sex life before she met me, even though she knows that doesn't make sense and I've made it abundantly clear that I don't have even the slightest issue with it and dislike the idea of chastity for my own personal reasons. 

I had noticed this all before, and addressed it a few times, but it had never become a real issue. I love her deeply, and I know trying to change someone you love is never a good idea, and also I understand that she has lived a life that makes breaking these perceptions incredibly difficult. In addition to the ""values"" she was raised with, she was abused by bother her mother and sister growing up. However, the other night things came to a head, and we finally got into an actual argument. She was telling me about how one of her guy friends (who is a card caring misogynist and serial cheater) broke up with his most recent girlfriend over, shockingly, cheating. She was defending him by saying that while cheating is bad, the women he's with should be smarter and know better. This was an especially glaring double standard since she found out one of her girlfriends was cheating on their boyfriend about a month ago, and they are still barely talking because she found that so morally objectable. During this argument, she openly admitted that she finds women cheating worse than men, which absolutely shocked me. 

I truly to love her deeply, but I just don't know how to feel. It's such a bizzare situation to feel so morally opposed to the views of your significant other. At the end of the day, I truly want what's best for her, and I believe the sexist views she holds aren't just social harmful, but also hurt her, because I've seen how she at times shames herself with them. I'm just not sure what to do.",1
"Should straight women stop calling each other ""Girlfriend""?","I was watching a Strange Aeons video (highly recommend this channel to every feminist) and she was talking about how her romantic relationships with women often aren't taken seriously. They get seen as best friends or even sisters, even when introducing each other as girlfriends (some people even ask, ""Like girl friend or girlfriend girlfriend?""). I checked the comment section and a lot of women seemed to have a common struggle when discussing relationships with parents and such. There were lots of complaints about how casual women can be when calling platonic friends ""girlfriends"", and it really made me think.

I've always found out odd when people call their friends ""Girlfriends"", because I'd never refer to buds as boyfriends. However, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this issue!",1
Why do you guys defend the child support system?,"Edit: The whole point of this post was so people wouldn't repeat the same arguments I already saw in past threads on this subreddit. Before you make an argument against one of the points in this post please read further down the post and see if I already responded to that argument.
____
I know questions about child support have been asked before, but none of the existing arguments made were convincing to me.

The main argument in favor of biological fathers paying child support is that without this system, the mother wouldn't have money to raise a child. That is, the law exists to support the child, not the wishes of the parents.

Well, public money can support the child instead, which wouldn't harm the mother or the child in any way. But wouldn't this be unfair, since the burden of paying shouldn't be put on the taxpayers? Well, if paying slightly more in taxes is such an unfair burden to the public, then it definitely isn't fair to put all the financial strain on the biological father.

That is, I think parenthood is a social construct; there's no reason a man should be considered a child's father (outside of a biological sense) just because he shares half of the child's DNA. Which why I assume it would be agreed that rape victims and sperm donors should not pay child support. But there are already documented instances of rape victims being forced to pay child support to their rapists.

The only way to avoid having male rape victims responsible for child support as the logical conclusion of the argument is to make an implicit underlying argument: that a man who has sex voluntarily is responsible for the child, and therefore deserves to pay child support. Which implies that when someone performs an activity carrying a risk of something bad happening, they're always responsible and to blame when the bad thing happens. I disagree with this.

If someone got into a car accident, we don't say they had it coming because they chose to drive a car in the first place despite being aware of the risks. In the same way, if a child is accidentally conceived even when both partners were using contraception, neither should be seen as responsible for the child.

Which is why I don't like the arguments made in this subreddit defending the child support system. To me it seems like the points typically made that ""it's only for the benefit for the child"" are disingenuous, and it's really just about punishing and blaming men for having sex using pro-life logic. I don't like that.

The child support system seems blatantly unfair to me. Women have a choice on whether or not they are considered a parent by the legal system, but men don't. The argument to this is that abortion is risky and can be a difficult choice. But it's better than not having a choice at all. And ideally a woman would be able to opt out of parenthood as well without getting an abortion. That seems much fairer than the current system, where one parent can opt out but the other cannot.

What are some arguments against this?",1
Thoughts around ‚Äúage appropriate‚Äù toys that seem... sexualized?,"So, LOL Dolls. My niece asked for these for Christmas. I didn‚Äôt get her one because they seem like dolls a pedophile would create as a means to help groom young children. My sister did get her daughter one of the dolls but is uncomfortable with it and is debating ‚Äúlosing‚Äù the doll.

I‚Äôm hoping I could get some input to help me organize my thoughts around these dolls, and maybe help me with how to talk to my sister about these dolls. I‚Äôm not going to offer her unsolicited advice - she‚Äôs genuinely conflicted about these dolls.

On the one hand, she doesn‚Äôt want her daughter to feel shamed for liking these dolls or to feel like it‚Äôs wrong for women to dress a certain way. On the other hand, these dolls are dressed in lingerie and that seems not age appropriate for a five year old. There was a line of the dolls that had lingerie appear when they were run under water. It just seems like it‚Äôs grooming children to dress sexy (not that it‚Äôs wrong for adult women to dress sexy, but even if these were dolls targeted at adult women, I don‚Äôt feel like these dolls are dressed in a ‚Äúyou‚Äôll feel sexy‚Äù kind of way, but more in a ‚Äúboys will think you‚Äôre sexy‚Äù kind of way). These dolls are for ages 5+.

I tried hunting around here to see if any discussion around these dolls came up previously and couldn‚Äôt find anything. I did find [this post on trashy](https://www.reddit.com/r/trashy/comments/ac2ql4/my_3_year_olds_lol_surprise_doll_she_got_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) on a reddit wide search, which I‚Äôve linked just so people can see what these dolls look like.

I really can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm being too uptight in thinking these dolls seem inappropriate for children, or if it‚Äôs probably not a good idea to give these to my niece.",1
What do you think about consent and a definition of rape regarding a problematic plot from later Wonder Woman 1984 film?(Spoiler),"The problem is that if the gender is swapped with Superman doing the same like wonder man, there will be a major outcry. The plot is that her death boyfriend come back into another man's body through some magic. Both main characters know that and have sex later.Worse thing is that the movie doesnt dive deeper into moral implications of that and brush off like nothing.
The  body owner come back later and doesnt know about anything, and diana doesnt show any remorse for that specific problem.
The movie is supposed to be a woman empowering one and also directed and written by a quite outspoken female director. Also, many in social media are saying like the guy should be grateful to be f#$ked by a literal goddess. I think this describes one of the major problem of society and also indirectly encouraging toxic masculanity like having sex is always a win for men.",1
"Is it just me, or are women (specifically women in the west) are often left out regarding issues concerning oppressed groups?

"Do you think Alita: Battle Angel counts as either feminist or feminist friendly, despite the fact that it has some non feminist elements? In my opinion, it's way more feminist then people have been saying.","I understand that Alita was created by a man and that she had to be saved by a man once. But here's the thing. She's only a ""submissive"" female character/female character without agency for around five or ten minutes of screen time. Then, she starts gradually gaining agency and assertiveness throughout the course of the movie and not letting the man who created her tell her what to do at all.  I get that some people would say that her being saved by a guy was supposed to send a message to the audience about how she shouldn't have became all independent and stopped listening to what the guy who created her had to say but after she gets ""repaired"" by him and given a new body, she goes right back to being a character with a ton of agency again who doesn't listen to what he has to say. 

Also, she does end up having to save her boyfriend in a way that does look like a gender reversal when it happens. In addition, I think it's kind of weird that anti-feminists love this movie so much since there's literally a scene when Alita beats up an entire room full of ""hunter warrior"" men which is the exact kind of thing that anti-feminists constantly complain about.",1

I Learn Something Very Valuable(At Least For Me) Today.,"As a heterosexual male... I have been trying to be aware and supportive of pro-women movements around the world. Everything from equality, genocide, harassment, and everything in between. On of the things I recently started doing is support movies and games with a female protagonist. Even if my girlfriend was not aware or wanted to see it, I would tell her. We watched the Birds of Prey movie... she didn‚Äôt enjoy it and neither did I. The story for me was bland, but the one thing the rubbed me the wrong way was the... (don‚Äôt know how to say it without sounding a dick or controversial, but here it goes) ‚Äúhate for men‚Äù. That‚Äôs the best way I can say it without going too deep. I saw it did not enjoy it but didn‚Äôt go out of my way to hate on it. 
NOW... fast forward to today after watching Wonder Woman 84, and I ended up with that same feeling. I sat down quietly and started to think about it. I came to the conclusion that those type of movies are the female equivalent to the testosterone filled action movies that have been out since the mid 70s. Dumb/fun movies with some sort of sexualization of women. WW84 made me see how women might‚Äôve felt when watching these type of movies. Obviously ww84 is more family friendly, but I get the overall idea. I know this sounds really naive and ignorant from my part, but I am just glad I now see it.

"Globally, the alt-right have been targeting Asian women on the dating market. What can we do about it?","There is this strange phenomenon which the supposedly racist, white alt-right dudes are obsessed with Asian women, and they have some very strange, fucked up ideas about us. If you don't know what I'm talking about, here's a good introduction from NYT: 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/opinion/sunday/alt-right-asian-fetish.html

I'm a first generation Chinese immigrant residing in US. Lately someone built an online community for Chinese female immigrants all over the world. Ideologically, this community skew highly educated feminists.

Someone in US posted about her experience of meeting an alt-right dude on a dating app, she discribed how she felt disgusted and terrified by the guy on their first date in person, and her thread exploded. 

Young Chinese women from all over the north america and europe shared similar experiences. We talked about strategies for identifying and dealing with these creepy dudes at length.

We started to realize this isn't some random bad luck but a global phenomenon. These dudes are intentionally approaching asian women. I've briefly looked into white supremacist communities out of curiosity. The Asian fetish and the mental gymnastics have been around for a while. I'm not surprised at all to see these Chinese women felt the real world impact. 

It's just the first time Chinese women start to actually talk about it, our conversation is both infuriating and fascinating.

Now we want to take actions to protect ourselves against racist and misogynist dudes. We want raise awareness and educate each others. We want to share our first-hand experiences with the broad Asian and feminist communities. We want to tell our side of the story and how we felt in these situations. We want our voices heard on this matter.

I'm thinking of taking this discussion to journalists. What media shall I reach out to? The ladies don't mind translate their posts into english. But before putting in all the work,  I want to find some media committed to publish them. Ideally they should have someone who can read Chinese.

What aren't we saying about setting boundaries in relationships?,"This goes for every type of relationship. Workplace, friendships, parental, and romantic. It's come to my attention lately that there are a lot of people in the world who have no concept of how to set boundaries, or even what healthy boundaries are. People will invade their space, touch others, or ignore their words and feelings by dismissing or belittling them. It's sad and scary to think people are still believing that this is okay.

Given, relationships are all different. There are still some basics that should be covered. School isn't something that has done a good job educating people about relationships, so sometimes people only have familial relationships to start learning from. If they have a bad home environment there are some things that they might think are normal.

There are a lot of topics to touch on, however, the biggest I feel would be boundary setting and what is and isn't acceptable. Gaining joy, acceptance, and a feeling of safety are what many hope to get out of a relationship. Even if no one is perfect it doesn't take much to stop and listen to what someone you care about is saying. So it's alarming when a person mentions that they feel lonely, ignored, or scared in a relationship. Should a person stretch themselves too thin it can be very draining.

So, where would be a good place to start in learning to set boundaries? Ideally, this is something that people should learn from their parents. Not everyone will get this though. The line 'my house, my rules' comes to mind. People can make their own rules should someone be living with them. However, it doesn't make it right to take away the freedom and autonomy of another. It often leads to people being stuck in abusive situations.

Extending on this, should someone grow up in a bad situation it might continue on in friendships and relationships. Picking on a spouse or being treated poorly by a spouse and thinking that these things are normal and okay. Often times even in media it'll rear its ugly head. There are so many jokes about a spouse being trapped or chained down. This shouldn't be a normal feeling.

People can also be extremely possessive or draining on friends. Some people need support and that's okay. However, it's not normal to dread speaking to a friend for whatever reason. So, my biggest concern is how can this start being addressed on a bigger scale? An open dialogue seems to be the best place to start.",1
Can men talk about sex and not be considered sexist?,I‚Äôve noticed that there has been talk about something called ‚Äúlocker room talk‚Äù.

Why are men so obsessed with who women choose to date? And why do men so outwardly express resentment and hate for women due to loneliness and rejection while women deal with the same issues by internalising them?,"Being a fireman and spending a lot of time with men, and then just seeing groups and posts by men, it's clear men have a bizarre obsession with who women choose to date.

And these men are all over the map with their resentment and anger of the type of men women choose.  It ranges from women dating broke and lazy men who treat them bad to women choosing well off men that spoil them and then everything in between as long as it's negative.  It seems like as long as they're not being picked, women just must be picking bad or subservient weak men.

These men, which I don't believe are a small minority, don't just resent women, they also resentment the men they date and automatically assume they're shitty men.  

And let's be clear here, these men only resent and hate women they consider attractive.  Women they don't, who also go through rejection and loneliness, they don't even exist in their mind.  Because women they don't deem attractive are invisible, because they don't matter.  This is why you basically see men's groups, whether their alt right or menslib, you rarely see an acknowledgement that rejected and lonely women exist.  Because they really don't in their minds.

Then of course these men turn to groups that are nothing but terrorist groups aimed at harming women.  Many turn violent and commit terrorist acts like mass murder, abuse, harassment, threats of rape and murder, etc.

I know the catch-all for men's issues is men can't express their feelings.  The reality is, men have been incredibly proficient in creating massive communities of support to vent their feelings.  I don't think anyone is unsure of how these men feel because their dealing with their issues stoicly or suppressing them.  They're pretty much in your face and have caught societies attention.  And they rarely pass up a chance to express their feelings to women.   So, I'm not sure I can believe not expressing emotions or feelings is part of the problem.

Lonely and rejected women just don't go to the extremes men go to.  And women tend to internalize rejection, they tend to blame themselves and at times deal with self-hatred for being unwanted.  And they tend to keep to themselves.  Men on the other hand are the squeaky wheel that gets the grease.  And they're making sure as many people as possible know how they feel.

So why do you think men and women react so differently to the same problem of being lonely and rejected?  And why are men so obsessed with who women date and women aren't obsessed with who men date?",1

History Question: Gender politics &amp; social stigma in ancient babylon,"Also asked this on r/history.

Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I have trouble remembering the details here, but way back when I took AP World I remember reading something about social stigma in ancient babylon but I don't know if my memory is correct or if this is bs. So, I thought I'd come here for a fact check. Anyways, I remember reading about the history of gender in the ancient world, and I remember coming across something interesting. Basically what the article said is that because property was passed down through the man in a marriage, a stigma arose around women sleeping with lots of other men. So, basically the idea was that since we could be 100% certain about the baby's mother but weren't necessarily sure of the father, there could be confusion as to whose property the kid would inherit. This could lead to lengthy legal problems, and just add up costs over time. To avoid this confusion, babylonian society began instituting laws and had a stigma around women sleeping with more than one guy. This gave rise to a stigma that influenced society up and to the present day (and is one that many people still hold, though that stigma has certainly died down a bit). Anyways, is that true? Idk if historically that is true, so I thought I would ask. I can't remember where I read that, so if you know of a source, could you please provide one? If it's not true, where did that stigma come from? To me it seems kinda dumb to base our current thinking on the property laws of a society that existed over a millennium ago, but that's just me. I'm just curious as to whether or not this is true. Thanks for the info!",1

Why do women tolerate household disarray less than men in non explicitly sexist relationships?,"I was looking at the ""mental load/you should have asked"" comic and it seems the woman is doing the work because the man doesn't see all the problems the woman sees or is comfortable with those problems existing. It seems that this couple doesn't explicitly view housework or childrearing as the woman's duty. What causes women to generally not wait until the man gets fed up with the mess and cleans it up himself? And if this discrepancy is resolved, would that solve a lot of the second shift problems in couples where housework isn't consciously assigned by gender?

Edit: how can already adult couples change so the woman is more tolerant of the mess and men less tolerant of the mess?

Most of the women I‚Äôve dated would call themselves feminists too. Despite this I feel I know little of the modern feminist movement and an trying to learn more. I started reading about toxic masculinity recently and it really got me thinking.

Most of the ‚Äòtoxic masculinity‚Äô I‚Äôve been exposed to are from women. My parents and my male friends never really forced me to adopt traditional male interests like sport or cars or violent video games. But I have been told I was ‚Äúgay‚Äù for trimming my nails by my first girlfriend, that I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt manly enough‚Äù because I was a vegetarian by another woman I dated, and that I was a ‚Äúpussy‚Äù for crying once, and have had many other similar things happen over the years.

I feel that I‚Äôve definitely learnt to suppress my emotions. If I feel upset or depressed I know there‚Äôs no way I can tell my partner
(despite her knowing all about toxic masculinity- she was the catalyst for me reading up about this stuff). At worst I‚Äôd be made fun of or have what I‚Äôve said be used against me in a future argument, at best it would just be awkward. Growing up I was told it was fine to express emotion, but as an adult I feel I‚Äôve been ‚Äútrained‚Äù by women to feel that it‚Äôs just not appealing or wanted. I‚Äôm in my 30s now and can definitely say that adopting a more traditional make traits like never talking about feelings has meant I‚Äôve had way more stable relationships (though it does suck sometimes - lesser of 2 evils).

Do you think women can perpetuate toxic masculinity? And where does normal masculinity   end and toxic masculinity start?

Do you think men have more to gain or to loose in ending the patriarchy ?,"I often read feminists writing things along the lines of ""men being in a dominant position in this patriarchy, they have no interests to question it"", and the likes. Though I agree that men have a dominant position and have therefore different interests, there certainly are antogonisms, this sounds a bit zero-sum to me. Many aspects of patriarchy are hurtful to men too, and if it's nowhere as bad as it is for women, it seems to me bad enough that ending the patriarchy is probably in the best interest of everyone.

This mindset seem problematic to me on several aspects, but mostly because framing most questions in terms of privileges men should give up, without emphasizing that they would also gain from giving them up, kind of makes feminism a threat to men when it doesn't have too, and a way tougher sell too.

I'm not saying this applies to each and every problematic, there are surely examples where this is false, but it feels to me that this is the case most often than not. I'd like to know if you feel the same.

There's probably a lot to say about the allyship vs. solidarity question here too, but I don't feel like I'm read enough on that question to discuss it (though my general feeling is that a synthesis would be good). If you want to comment on this however I would be interested too.

Another thing I think stems from this kind of thinking that I'm not too comfortable with: it gives the impression that men kind of have their common interests sorted out and this what guides their opinion and actions. But men just do what's seems best, or not too bad, for themselves in the context they are in, which happen to be patriarchy. It's not uncommon that when a man expresses certain opinions, arguments like ""of course you'd say this, everything to keep your privileges"", like this is part of mens strategy or something, and when women express the exact same thing suddenly it becomes internalized sexism or equivalent. Like women cannot understand how that serves a system, but men can. That's IMO both inaccurate, and troubling, how feminists are often prone to give an agency to men they're denying women...

If you feel like I got that position wrong, men having no interests in toppling patriarchy because of their dominant position in it, clarifications are welcome too.",1

Female Firefighters,"Hi all,

I recently checked out the percentage of female firefighters in the UK and it's [a measly 6.4 %](https://www.nationalfirechiefs.org.uk/News/new-statistics-show-an-increase-in-female-firefighters#:~:text=The%20increase%20in%20the%20number,and%20rescue%20services%20were%20women). In the US it's only [around 4%](https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/Emergency-Responders/US-fire-department-profile#:~:text=In%202018%2C%2093%2C700%20(8%25),30%20and%2049%20years%20old).

I have personal reasons for looking into this but I guess I had a bit of an inkling that the figures for female fire fighters would be quite low. The below is from [this](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/firefighters/#:~:text=Roughly%204%25%20of%20firefighters%20are,fitness%20standards%20needed%20for%20firefighting) article which looks at some of the reasons as to why the figures for female fire fighters are low.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**In their paper, Danbold and Bendersky argue that acceptance of women in the fire service is hindered by a clash between the collection of traits seen as essential to be a good firefighter ‚Äî called prototypes ‚Äî and the social stereotypes commonly assigned to men and women. If the prototypical firefighter is someone who carries people out of burning buildings, that‚Äôs going to fit more closely with masculine stereotypes. That, in turn, makes it harder to imagine a woman in that role.**

Looking at the stats for female police officers (29% in the UK, 11.9% US), which arguably also has traditionally been viewed as a 'man's job', the figures are much higher. I am now wondering why there is such a lag in the firefighting service compared to the police, which are both 'emergency services' with the purpose of helping people in distress.

(My theory is that image of the firefighter is akin to the  'knight in shining armour' and that a female firefighter would not fit that ideal of the masculine saviour. Just to reiterate this is just my personal theory.) EDIT: just realised that the excerpt above substantiates this

I'm not convinced pubic hair removal is rooted in pedophilia,"I've seen folks criticize the idea of a hairless body as a beauty standard in the west and claim its rooted in pedophilia such as removing the pubic hair However, I am not so sure as for example, Islam is not western and has guidelines to shave body hair as well and the religion has had a long prescence in places like Western Africa and the middle east. As well, I am curious how body hair removal is seen is other cultures, so due to this, I think saying a desire for it being rooted in pedophilia is just reaching. Any thoughts?",1
I am pro-choice and a preference utilitarian. I have asked this on r/askphilosphy but I wanted to ask y'all as well. Here is basically my thoughts on preference utilitarianism and abortion and I wanted to make sure that it made sense and was coherent. Thanks for reading it!,"Hello,

So I am a two-level preference utilitarian ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference\_utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_utilitarianism)). Basically anything on a system level (like how we should run government, etc) I tend to be more rule based and on an individual level more classically based. Anyways, the question of abortion inevitably invites extensive moral arguments (I come from a pretty conservative family and am a man (clearly the perfect voice for abortion  and women's issues /s), but I tend to be the only one who's pro-choice in family arguments and I wanted to make sure my thoughts make sense before discussing with family). Here's my take and I wanted to see if I had a flaw in my thinking (based on the initial principles, i.e. preference utilitarianism) and if what I say makes sense. So here goes:

I believe it is ok for a woman to have an abortion should she desire it because the vast vast majority of abortions take place when it's either in the earlier fetal stage or just a clump of cells (it is ok at later stages as well, it's just easier to discuss if we talk about a clump of cells). Those cells aren't sentient, and they don't have preferences, but a woman does, so her preference overrides that of the cells. Now, the counter to this that I have spent the most time thinking about is: Well doesn't that cluster of cells have a future to consider? Couldn't it have preferences that could be fulfilled? Yes, that's true, but the keyword is could. There is no guarantee that the cells would become a human being would on net fulfill the desires of those around them. They could be a fundamentally unhappy person who doesn't want to live the life they're living. They could also be the next Bill Gates, we have no way of knowing. You can't know that for certain. Personally, I find the first option more likely because by definition if a woman wants an abortion, she clearly doesn't want a kid, so she's not likely going to be the best mother she can be, it's just not really possible because deep down their preference to not be a mother would add up over time. That is a very strong preference and the kid would really have be guaranteed to satisfy a lot of preferences to overcome that. And frankly, we can't know if they will. Sure maybe, but we do know that the mother doesn't want to be a mother here and now, and we can predict this will likely remain true in the future. That's not even to factor in the preferences that would be satisified if we treated everyone like that had a right to personal autonomy (in perference utilitarianism this idea is where rights come from). This is all true of cases where the mother's life isn't in danger, but it is even more true in cases where her life is in danger (after all, she'd prefer to you know, not die), so that is an even stronger preference. Fundamentally, because there is a guarantee that the mother will have deep unsatisfied preferences that only add up over time (she may have to sacrifice opportunities and dreams she would've otherwise taken to be a mother), and the serious lack of a guarantee that the child would fulfill preferences, we have to treat the child's life as neutral and look at the negative utility that results from pregnancy, we find that the mother should be able to have an abortion should she so desire.

Also, side note #1. If we take the cells could live a happy life conclusion to its logical end, then technically every single genetically possible human should be created, and not only that, but we should engage in extensive cloning efforts because more people = more preferences met. Nobody is advocating for this, for good reason.

Side Note #2. Adoption. I will admit this one is trickier to address and may seem, from a ultilitarian point of view, a better option than abortion, however the statistics from adoption don't usually look all that good, and you have to factor in the negative utility that comes from pregnancy in and of itself and the negative utility from a lack of a right to bodily autonomy, as such, abortion is still a viable and good option to take in that situation. Plus if we see adoption as better because it allows the preferences of the cells to be met, clearly side not #1 is also true, so you and I shouldn't be arguing as you should be off making ever single genetically possible human and cloning yourself. Doing otherwise is hypocritical.

Anyways, is this coherent and does it make sense?

Thanks!

Edit:

Forgot to add, the huge number of abortions that result from sexual assault, rape, and truly tragic circumstances. It is even easier to argue for allowing abortion in those cases because of the strong preferences involved. Also, as many a feminist has pointed out, outlawing abortion inevitably lead to illegal abortions, which are always shadier, and riskier, but will definitely happen. ",1

Are women‚Äôs dating preferences problematic?,"What are your thoughts on women‚Äôs preferences for men that earn more than themselves and for men that exhibit benevolent sexist behaviours? There is a vast amount of literature documenting women‚Äôs preference for men that are [high earners](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40806-016-0048-6#Sec10), even for women with a [higher education](https://ifstudies.org/blog/better-educated-women-still-prefer-higher-earning-husbands) and income. Although according to [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/20/americans-see-men-as-the-financial-providers-even-as-womens-contributions-grow/), as of 2017, women earn more than men in 28% of married and cohabiting couples, which is promising progress. Yet, despite¬†the prevalence of this preference I do not see it discussed very much, if at all, by feminists. This is surprising to me as I would have thought feminists would be imploring women to prioritise other qualities in a potential partner, such as: empathy, egalitarianism, kindness, patience, etc.

However, what is even more surprising is a [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325153053_Benevolent_Sexism_and_Mate_Preferences_Why_Do_Women_Prefer_Benevolent_Men_Despite_Recognizing_That_They_Can_Be_Undermining) that found that women prefer men that possess benevolent sexist attitudes despite the [potential downsides](https://theconversation.com/why-women-including-feminists-are-still-attracted-to-benevolently-sexist-men-101067). This was true for ‚Äúhigh feminist and low feminist women‚Äù. Is it not a problem that¬†a significant portion of women, including feminist women,¬†prefer¬†benevolent sexist men? Surely this must be worth addressing if we want gender equality.¬†¬†

I consider myself a feminist and am posing this question in good faith so I hope we can have an honest discussion about the subjects above. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

"Even when girl's education led to them being firmly shackled to domestication, girl's still outperformed boys in academia in all subjects. Studies show the ""boy crisis"" has been going on for at least a century. What's the problem?","Quote from the [TIME](https://time.com/81355/girls-beat-boys-in-every-subject-and-they-have-for-a-century/) article:  *Stereotypes are hard to break, and when it comes to education and gender, parents ‚Äî and students ‚Äî stick with a firmly held belief that girls* [*don‚Äôt do as well in math and science*](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953389,00.html)*, while boys don‚Äôt have great language and reading skills.*

*A review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million boys and girls who were students from 1914 to 2011 blows apart that idea. For 100 years, according to the data that included students from 30 countries, girls have been outperforming boys in all of their classes ‚Äî reading, language and math and science. And they‚Äôve been doing it throughout their academic careers, from elementary school to high school. Which also means that the ‚Äúboy crisis‚Äù ‚Äî the worry that boys have recently been falling precipitously behind girls academically ‚Äî is also a fallacy. They‚Äôve been getting lower grades than girls for a century.*

Even when sexism and misogyny cut off the vast majority of careers and the workforce to women, and girls could really only dream of becoming maybe a nurse, secretary or teacher, they still outperformed boys who had access to higher education, the majority of careers and the workforce.  Just based on that you'd think girl's would believe education was a waste of time, leading to resentment and there would be a ""girl crisis"" where girl's would get lower grades than boys.

So girl's outperforming boys, even in math and science isn't something new.  Despite the myth we so often seen propagated in alt right and even progressive men's groups that this is a relatively new phenomenon plaguing boys due to the ""feminization"" of academia.  And when it comes to higher education women get more scholarships so it's cheaper, despite the fact that women are on the hook for almost 70% of the [1.5  trillion dollar student debt crisis](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/13/american-women-hold-two-thirds-of-all-student-debt-heres-why.html).

Marxist Feminism: What are cis white men supposed to be doing?,"Hello all and thanks to any and all giving their time to read or reply.

I'm a cis white male who has spent a lot of time studying Marxism, communism, etc... and have been trying lately to incorporate a lot of Marxist Feminism/Intersectional feminism into my studies. I've had a really hard time ingesting this material and an even more difficult time ingesting  more liberal/centrist feminism. I understand the need for spaces where men aren't allowed to communicate, nearly every podcast I could find on these topics was female-exclusive, but where is the bridge for cis white men to even understand the concepts that are being taught? Every five minutes is a random gut punch where a host, usually a PhD or Masters level white woman, takes a crack at cis white men (usually always random and for the purpose of some type of joke), and I find myself wondering how long I can listen before giving up. For context I've listened several hundred hours of Marxist content and probably 20-30 hours of Feminist Marxist content. At the end of every segment I am still left wondering what is wanted from me and generally just left with the impression that disappearing is the only desired outcome. Very rarely a white male makes an appearance, on the few podcasts where they're allowed, and there is always a lot of them just joining in on the bashing with little information on what the appropriate action is from a white male.

I'm just kind of confused. I could never share any of these podcasts with my brother or even male peers be they white or not because they seem uninterested in offering actionable content so much as just random ridicule. As a white male who grew up in a trailor park and still can't make ends meet, with a lot of abuse and trauma to boot, I guess I'm just not sure how modern or left feminism intends to overcome the struggles of a patriarchal or capitalist society without white men.

I apologize if I'm coming from such a narrow perspective but I'm just lost after a lot of time and research. I know we live in a patriarchy. I know we live in a white supremacist world. What I don't understand is how extremely well educated women plan on broke af white men ever gaining the perspectives and knowledge necessary to help be part of the solution. Thanks for any insights you can give and please give any critiques you want as well. I'm trying to gain thicker skin through all of this and my personal leanings are toward a socialistic/communistic end. I think the patriarch harms men as much as women if you look at the death and trauma boys go through, but I'm just not seeing a lot of compassion coming out of any of the places I seek perspective from and I'm having a really hard time figuring out how I am supposed to move or contribute to solutions.

A former male friend hates feminism in my DM's,"I post many different topics on my private Instagram account, from diet culture, racism, to the fall of patriarchy and personal experiences with men. A guy (23) from my former school class has been following me for half a year. We haven't seen each other for 3 years. He always seemed nice and harmonious and we got along great. No drama, no sexism, nothing. Since he has followed me, he has been answering my statements in the stories 3 times a week, accusing me of hating men and that a lot more people would listen to me if I were to formulate my feminist opinion ""nicer"". The usual talk.  But even when I deal with other topics that don't attack him as a man (e.g. ""Calorie reminder for the holidays: 1200 calories are the daily requirement of a toddler. Not that of an adult woman."") he texts me and annoys me. He describes my information as baseless and compares me to a flat earther.

He uses various manipulation techniques when I call him out on his behavior: ""I'm sorry that I questioned you. Maybe I'm just controlled by patriarchy and the diet culture!"" He is committed to misunderstanding me.

We text back and forth. Sometimes I think he has a romantic interest in me because he often attacks me when I've posted nice selfies beforehand. On the other hand, I'm taken and he has had a girlfriend for 2 years. And knocking someone down is not nice either. I don't want to block him because I've always liked him.

Dismissing sexual frustration,"As a guy I believe the following statements are true 

1. Wanting romantic/sexual companionship and not having it sucks, and the longer you go without it, the more it sucks.
2. No other human being on the planet is obliged to provide you with such companionship, and there is no sure-fire formula for getting it.

Now, if a chronically single man agrees with me that both of these statements are true. The best we as a society can do is commiserate the tragedy of human existence. But from what I've seen, almost everytime someone says how much rejection/friendzone/unrequited love/etc, makes them feel horrible, someone else will make a rather unfriendly and dismissive comment about how ""women don't owe you sex"" or something about ""putting niceness in and expecting sex to come out"". Even when there's absolutely no indication that person thinks so.

Some people might say it's common enough to just assume they have these beliefs. But I disagree that this is how you justify being shitty to someone. It is presumptive, aggressive, accusatory, and rude. People can feel frustrated about it without also feeling entitled. I don't think it's unreasonable for someone to say ""I'm frustrated because I'm not able to start a relationship or have sex"" without being told they're an entitled twat for that.

And I think this is at the core of the problem of why male loneliness is at a record high. People are always ready to point out statement #2, but they don't really internalize the significance of statement #1. This is what leads to incel communities being made and the male suicide rate being 3.5x higher than women. Not only are lonely men not able to find satisfaction in their lives, they are constantly having there issues and feelings dismissed.

What do you do when your family has non-feministic attitudes?,"I have just found out that my younger sister ‚Äôs teacher makes what I think are inappropriate and sexist jokes. My sister thinks it is ok for her (male) teacher to make jokes about a girl‚Äôs appearance (joking in a zoom class about her not wearing makeup and looking bad because of it), and inappropriate jokes about a fellow female teacher (on zoom this male teacher and a female teacher turned up wearing the same colours. The female teacher commented on the coincidence joking that they must share the same wardrobe, the male teacher ‚Äújoked‚Äù that they put on the same clothes/colours just after getting out of bed together‚Ä¶). My sister thinks this is funny and not gendered, everyday sexism hidden in the form of a joke to justify it. She says he does it to everyone but the only two examples she could give me where when he made jokes about the girl and woman (therefore in this instance, clearly gendered).

My mum‚Äôs attitude is that we just need to take a step back and let the world ‚Äúsort itself out‚Äù. When I push back on her attitude by saying, ‚Äú*We* have to sort the world out, it‚Äôs not just going to do it by itself‚Äù, she changes the subject and glosses over what I am saying. My other family members are basically the same, with the women in my family full of internalised misogyny, and I can‚Äôt seem to resonate with any of them for very long about feminism as a whole. Because of this I am finding I am distancing myself from them more and more as it just infuriates and frustrates me that they won‚Äôt see/aren‚Äôt willing to see how 3rd wave feminism is a good thing and how it is very much needed in our current society.

How do I reach them and teach them about the need for feminism in a way that they‚Äôll actually listen? How do I show my sister that feminism is good and that there is everyday sexism that she is shrugging off? Sadly, I really doubt that there is much hope of changing my mum and the other family members as they‚Äôre stubborn and their believes are deeply ingrained in them, but I really want to try to reach my sister even if it is just to get her thinking about everyday encounters from a feminist perspective. Obviously, I don‚Äôt want to push it on her if she really doesn‚Äôt want to listen, but I want to try as I don‚Äôt want to distance myself from her too.

Question about abortion,"I am 100% pro-choice and I believe, that abortion should be legal until the fetus is able to survive on its own. However I am very concerned with the trend, that many cis women decide to abort fetuses with traits they deem as undesirable (we see this trend in iceland with down's syndrome fetuses).

As more scientific progress occurs, I fear that cis women will choose to abort other fetuses, that they deem undesirable (like gay people, trans people, people with autism) as soon as it is scientifically possible to detect these things in a fetus. There would only have to be a minor cultural shift and cis women have the choice to exterminate any group of people they want.

My question is how can we ensure, that trans, gay, autistic and other people will not disappear like down's syndrome people in iceland, as soon as these traits are detectable?",1
Do you feel that it's wrong/unreasonable for a man/woman to expect the person they are dating to abstain from sex while they are initially testing the waters?,"Of course anyone has a right to set their own boundaries, reasonable or otherwise. But do you find it reasonable or perhaps toxic/reductive if someone only wants to get serious when their partner has waited to have sex during the early stages? Does it say something bad about them?

Is it unreasonable to break up with someone if you found out that while you were dating  that they'd been hooking up with other people? Is it odd for that to bother you? Not expecting your partner to be a virgin whose never been in a relationship but specifically when the two of you were dating.  Is this a bad standard to put on people?",1
Gay and bi men,"

***Arguments for why feminism has failed:***

Men still -

1. run 91% of countries (175 out of 192)
2. run 95% of companies [https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-so-few-ceos-are-women-you-can-have-a-seat-at-the-table-and-not-be-a-player-11581003276](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-so-few-ceos-are-women-you-can-have-a-seat-at-the-table-and-not-be-a-player-11581003276)
3. are 90% of millionaires [https://www.verdict.co.uk/90-percent-millionaires-male/](https://www.verdict.co.uk/90-percent-millionaires-male/)
4. are 88% of billionaires [https://www.statista.com/statistics/778577/billionaires-gender-distribution/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/778577/billionaires-gender-distribution/)
5. see 22% of their workforce make $100,000 or above in the United States compared to just 9% of women [https://dqydj.com/2018-income-by-sex/](https://dqydj.com/2018-income-by-sex/).

* The gender pay gap remains stagnant. In the US for instance, men earned $66,000 on average pre-tax in 2017 compared to women making $45,000. In 2020, it's $72,000 to $51,000. The pay gap is larger in other first world countries and of course much larger in second and third world territories, and it's expected to RISE rather than decrease in the future due to the effects of the pandemic.
* Violence against women is at it's highest rates in decades, in the US, Europe and elsewhere around the world. Femicides in particular are surging at levels rarely seen before. Some of the sources on the growing violence can be seen here [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-games/201909/the-number-women-murdered-partner-is-rising](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-games/201909/the-number-women-murdered-partner-is-rising), here [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/domestic-violence-international.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/domestic-violence-international.html) and here [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-latam-violence-trf/rising-violence-against-women-in-latin-america-confirms-fears-of-abuses-in-lockdowns-idUSKBN23G2X6](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-latam-violence-trf/rising-violence-against-women-in-latin-america-confirms-fears-of-abuses-in-lockdowns-idUSKBN23G2X6).
* Female employment on the whole is at its lowest levels since 1988 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/2020/11/06/women-workforce-jobs-report/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/2020/11/06/women-workforce-jobs-report/) and the figures could well struggle to rebound for a generation [https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-55016842](https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-55016842).
* Women continue to struggle to break into high-paying male dominated fields, comprising a majority in low paying professions like nursing, teaching and healthcare while struggling to climb above 10-15% of money making jobs in engineering, finance, law or as doctors etc. An example of this can be seen in a gender breakdown of doctors by speciality [https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2018/10/men-outnumber-women-3-to-1-in-some-specialties-in-the-u-k/](https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2018/10/men-outnumber-women-3-to-1-in-some-specialties-in-the-u-k/).",1

What should a guy do if they see someone getting catcalled or harassed?,"Hello,

I'm a guy. I saw a post on here today about someone being unsure of what to do when they are catcalled. I realized that had I been in the situation the poster there described, I wouldn't have known what to do. So, I thought I'd ask: how should I respond when I see someone getting catcalled or harassed? Like say I'm at work and I notice my boss being too touchy-feely with a female co-worker and she has expressed to me it makes her uncomfortable. What should I do in that situation? Should I even intervene or should I leave the situation alone, I want to help but I don't want to make things worse. I don't know, as a guy I've never been catcalled or harassed. I don't really know how to respond if I see it happening or even if i should for fear of making things worse for the victim. So yeah, how do I respond?

Why there are women who aren‚Äôt feminists?,,1
"Is saying America or Canada have a problem with femicide as well as it being unsafe for women an insult to other nations like Mexico, SA, etc?","I see American/Canadian feminists claim that we have a problem with 'femicide' in America or Canada.

I personally dont know any woman who's been murdered. Hell, in my state of colorado, with a pop.of 5million, the number of murders was what, 32 in 2018? In my very safe city, not sure the number, I'd wager it's LESS than 10.

My neighborhood is also safe. I see girls out all the time, day and night. None of them seem to be in any fear. Hell, my sisters and mom used to go out all the time b4 covid. My sister doesnt fear going out at night at all.

It's been like this everywhere I've lived. Not sure if it's just the girls I interact, but none of them seem to fear going out at all in night. None of them seem to be as scared as you would think when you read feminists comments online (that women fear going out aline at night). It's like this here, as well as back in AZ. Or when I visit fam in Xanada.

My main question is, is saying America (or Canada) has an issue with femicide an insult to other countries like Colombia, SA? Also, I've seen the 3women/killed per day in America. That amounts close to 1100 women murdered per year in America. With a pop. of 320mil. Compared to others nation with a MUCH lower population, as well as more women being killed. Is this diminishing the meaning of femicide?",1
"If feminism is the advocacy for gender equality, then why do feminists seem to refuse to call the movement egalitarianism?","I'm asking, because doesn't it imply an inherent non egalitarian approach to egalitarianism in the sense that it suggests a gender of primary interest?

Do you think feminist rhetoric can cause sexual repression in young men who are most sympathetic to feminist concerns?,"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070917210115/http://www.feministcritics.org/blog/2007/06/19/when-you-have-feminist-guilt-you-dont-need-catholic-guilt/](https://web.archive.org/web/20070917210115/http://www.feministcritics.org/blog/2007/06/19/when-you-have-feminist-guilt-you-dont-need-catholic-guilt/)

This blogpost is what made me want to ask this question, so please read through it if you'd like. But it's basic argument is that there are a hell of a lot of people attracted to women who seem to have internalized the message that their attraction makes them sick and wrong and evil and creepy, that basically any interaction they have with a woman is coercive or harmful on their part, and that initiating a romantic interaction makes them a sexual predator.

I relate to this post quite a lot. I internalized these messages from exposure to feminist memes, norms, and communities. It was feminist messages, not catholic or religious ones, that made it hardest for me to come to terms with my sexuality. It wasn‚Äôt intentional. But it happened. And it has happened by now to enough people that 'well obviously you‚Äôre misinterpreting it‚Äô is starting to wear thin as an excuse. Lots and lots of people are misinterpreting the way I did. By and large, we‚Äôre vulnerable people. I suppose the response I expect the most is a denial of the existence of this phenomenon, or even the possibility of it. But that would just prove to me that the male experience will always be invalidated in the face of the dominant narrative, irrespective of how much it matters.",1
"What do you think about this statement from 'The Palgrave Handbook of Male Psychology and Mental Health' regarding the phrase ""toxic masculinity""?","&gt;There is a serious risk arising from using terms such as ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù. Unlike ‚Äúmale depression‚Äù, which helps identify a set of symptoms that can be alleviated with therapy, the term ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù has no clinical value. In fact it is an example of another cognitive distortion called labelling (Yurica et al. 2005). Negative labelling and terminology usually have a negative impact, including self-fulflling prophecies and alienation of the groups who are being labelled. We wouldn‚Äôt use the term ‚Äútoxic‚Äù to describe any other human demographic. Such a term would be unthinkable with reference to age, disability, ethnicity or religion. The same principle of respect must surely apply to the male gender. It is likely therefore that developing a more realistic and positive narrative about masculinity in our culture will be a good thing for everyone.",1

But what about people (of all genders) who are considered ‚Äúlazy‚Äù or ‚Äúdeadbeat‚Äù if they don‚Äôt have ambition or their life figured?

What are your issues with pornhub? What are some alternatives?,"Recently porn hub has deleted over 1 million videos created by unverified users to try to remedy some recent complaints about videos that have violated their guidelines.


 A lot of people have been critical of this move but I personally like that they‚Äôre attempting to pay CLOSER attention to abuse and general fucked up shit on their site. 

 I‚Äôve abstained from a lot of the mainstream porn sites these past couple of months. My main Hang ups about most of the sites is that they seem indifferent to abuse on their site. 

Due to the vast nature these that are inherent to these YouTube-like platforms, I don‚Äôt expect EVERYTHING to be clean. Even on YouTube there are some pretty fucked up corners, just because there‚Äôs some illegal shit on their site doesn‚Äôt mean they support it. But I also think that porn sites are a lot more vulnerable to illegal fucked up shit cuz it‚Äôs to appease the viewers sexual hunger. So I think it should be a high priority to moderate these sites for the safety of people all over the world since they‚Äôre inherently MORE LIKELY to contain that content.

Again, this isn‚Äôt a fool proof method. But I do respect that they‚Äôre directly addressing this issue.

I came back to the site to give it my, let‚Äôs say ‚Äúviewer support‚Äù but my question to y‚Äôall is, what are some of your hang ups or criticisms with specifically pornhub. I don‚Äôt think porn is inherently misogynistic, but I don‚Äôt wanna enable some misogynistic tendencies (if that wording makes sense). I dont wanna lean on ONE THING I respect about pornhub to justify all the other BS that goes on behind the scenes. Porn is nice, but some things matter more than momentary fulfillment.

Another question, what are some good alternatives to the mainstream porn sites? Mainly, porn sites with a feminist mindset or a site that‚Äôs heavily moderated to prevent abuse from slipping under the cracks. 

Bellesa was a pretty nice one that‚Äôs free. Other sites I‚Äôve searched have only had a paying option. Maybe it‚Äôs just the reality that you have to pay to support some of these underground sites, but any feedback would be appreciated.",1

Why do people forget that the FGM ban declared unconstitutional - because of male circumcision,"So First off I am strongly against all forms of genital cutting, which makes me a subject of ridicule in the United States, where most people support male circumcision and body shame people like me who are intact. So recently I found out that FGM became legal in the United States because the ban was ruled unconstitutional because it included a ban on all forms of FGM, including the rare minor form Called hoodectomy, which is directly equivalent to male circumcision. I am aware that most of you are against circumcision and I am grateful to know that. I am wondering why people haven‚Äôt realized that to eradicate all forms of FGM we constitutionally must ban male circumcision and intersex surgeries as well. The only way to ban hoodectomy is to ban male circumcision with it. Do you have some ideas why people didn‚Äôt pay attention to the fact that male circumcision is causing FGM to become legal? I‚Äôd like to have some insight and figured this would be a good place to share ideas to spread awareness about circumcision and how it is keeping FGM from being banned like it should be.",1

Are men more driven and career-oriented?,"Do men derive more pleasure from career fullfilment than women? For example, women want equal representations in top positions etc., but they tend to want work life balance, and men at the top don't want to give in to that/can get away with not taking time off for kids etc., thus they can put in more work and continue to dominate top positions.

I think even women who are committed to their work and their professional goals, who want to contribute something to the world, are interested in pursuing other things/interests, making time for family (not neccesarily children), making sure that a household runs smoothly and that everyone around them is taken care of etc., more than men are.

Is this because of how men and women are raised, or because of our biological make-up, or both? Should we try to change this? if so, in what way?

Women/Girl's pain treated less seriously than Men/Boy's pain.,"[Study's have found that female patient's pain is treated less seriously as male patient's pain.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/31/americans-take-pain-girls-less-seriously-than-that-boys-new-study-finds/)  This article is dealing with young girl's pain but there are studies that show that [women's pain is taken less seriously than men's pain.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/is-bias-keeping-female-minority-patients-from-getting-proper-care-for-their-pain/2019/07/26/9d1b3a78-a810-11e9-9214-246e594de5d5_story.html)  Women are not only have to wait longer to receive medication for pain, they receive pain med's less than men.  And women are given psychiatric medication for pain at a much higher rate than men.  

As a first responder it wasn't unusual for EMT's to assess women for mental conditions before treating them for pain.  It also wasn't unusual for EMT's to question whether women were exaggerating their pain because of course, women are more emotional and neurotic than men.  Men are strong, stoic and reliable when talking about their pain, so if a man says he's hurting, get him some pain meds stat because it must be serious.

The biggest myth I see in progressive men's groups like menslib and alt-right groups is that the medical community ignores men and caters to women.  This must be why women access medical help more often than men?  But the truth is, women are not rewarded for being proactive about their health.  They're stigmatized as being dramatic and emotional attention seekers.  Whereas men are brave and stoic and only access help when absolutely needed.  

Just because the medical community targets women in ads doesn't mean women or girl's are treated well once they try to receive help.  Women are targeted for monetary gain because they know women are more likely to access help which means more money for hospitals and doctors.  The myth propagated by men's groups that the medical community just loves and cares about women more than men is laughable in the face of studies done in regards to the different treatment men and women receive. 

I'm interested in hearing feminist's thoughts on this subject.  How women are treated by medical professionals and why it's such a common myth that when women enter the medical system that they're needs are catered to, when studies show the exact opposite.",1

Becoming a respected leader non-violently vs. Turning into an infamous criminal), and women having little say on the matter.

So when it came to educational institutions historically banning women from entering school, they could attribute it to schools being more likely to teach about fighting and therefore girls weren't allowed in schools. There was a point where these institutions no longer required to teach students solely about fighting yet they still demanded to latch onto those traditions and justify preventing women from entering .

So here's a question and I hope that its appropriate‚Ä¶," 

If  some male actually did the awful thing of sexually approaching a few or  couple of females inappropriately and uninvited or sexually harassing  them when he was too drunk (not that that's an excuse,as he chose to get  that drunk) before in life (and he stopped after the no and/or more  clearer -perhaps including even physical- no's to his absolutely drunken  mind at the times and then that was it as in he did not do something  like that again after those times, to whoever)‚Ä¶

Does  that mean that he deserves to be falsely accused (either officially to  the authorities or while being the victim of false rumors,gossips and  slander) later on in life by another female or other females of sexual  harassment or assault or rape or having sex or doing something sexual  with or to them when he did nothing of the sort with or to them? It's an  obvious no to me but would some people perhaps think that he deserves  it? I think that even if one not only approached and stopped after the  rejection but actually insistently sexually harassed someone or raped  them then that doesn't mean that that person deserves to be falsely  accused of other things by whoever‚Ä¶",1
Why are sexist characters on television always written to be charismatic?,"The ones that immediately come to mind are Joey from Friends and Barney from How I Met Your Mother, as they have a tendency to objectify female characters on their shows and lie to women when pursuing sex.

Why is it then that despite increases in medical technology to prevent unwanted birth which has granted women control over their sexual reproduction has out of wedlock births, teenage pregnancy, single motherhood is increasing and continues to increase? 
This mainly effects lower class people than upper class as is seen with the increased calls for welfare, food stamps, government subsidized child care among other things.",1
Does using products/services made in a toxic work environment make me a hypocrite?,"So just for the record I wouldn't exactly label myself as a feminist activist, but I do have strong feminist leanings and I believe women should continue to fight for equal rights in order to bring an end to sexual harassment, the glass ceiling, and an end to the toxic work environment.

From what I understand a toxic work environment is where minorities, disabled people, LGBTQ groups, and especially women are harassed, there is a culture of nepotism, and a majority of employees are constantly overworked and underpaid. When I learned about this concept I promised myself that I would not work for a company that has a toxic work environment or buy any products or services that are made by a toxic work environment.

Hopefully the first one won't be too hard, but it's the second part that worries me. I looked up some companies that have toxic work environment and I was surprised that some of my favorite companies like Disney has a toxic work environment. I know this sounds superficial but some of my favorite stress-relieving media comes from these companies like the marvel comics and movies, the pixar movies, the Studio Ghibli films, and so much more. I'm sure it may sound like peanuts to some people but these things from Disney help me have some thing to look forward to at the end of the day.

The problem is that well I feel like I'm not being true to myself because a lot of the work that the employees put into these products, are overworked, underpaid, and sometimes harassed by the upper management. I feel as if that by buying/using the products of a company that has a toxic environment I'm betraying a part of myself.

Does using a company's products and services really make me a moral hypocrite? Is there anyway to rationalize my choices?",1
"Several women in the US have recently been charged with murder after giving birth to stillborn babies.

Why is feminism becoming increasingly hostile towards queer people?,"Over the last couple of years I have observed what I perceive to be a significant increase in hostility towards trans people among self-identified feminists. This is especially evident in countries like the UK where transphobic feminists have a lot of institutional power and are being portrayed by the media as the dominant type of feminism. I get that a lot of this is astroturfed by conservative lobby groups like the heritage foundation and Alliance defending freedom, but I am fascinated and shocked by how so many feminists are so easily influenced by rhetoric that mirrors the hate other minority groups and women have been victims of in the past. What fascinates me even more is the increased willingness of these people to not only attack trans people, but also the broader queer community. To add even more confusion to the mix, many of these people hold positions that are very similar to mine on the overwhelming majority of feminist issues, but have seemingly bought into anti-queer propaganda for no apparent reason.

Any hate or discrimination towards minority groups is incompatible with my feminism, but I am afraid that simply brushing them off as not being feminists, is actively ignoring a growing problem that is increasingly seeping into broader feminist discourse. Why do some feminists have a propensity towards queerphobia, and why do so many seemingly progressive and reasonable people buy into regressive social ideologies that are better left in the past?",1
Do Radical Feminists consider Queer Theory to be liberal feminism?,"Do Radical Feminists consider Queer Theory to be ""liberal feminism?""

It should come as no surprise that many radical feminists like to disagree with what they term ""liberal feminists."" Those that do also tend to disagree with a lot with 3rd wave feminists, often describing third wave feminists as ""liberal feminists."" Well, queer theory is largely recognized to be part of the third wave; it tends to be sex positive, largely propelling the sex-positive feminist movement forward, and in that aspect, tends to emphasize the importance of sexual choice.

But queer theory is grounded in continental philosophy (as is a lot of third wave feminism like intersectionality), and queer theorists like Foucault have been very critical of liberalism in general. They probably wouldn't describe themselves as the same kind of feminist as Martha Nussbaum who identifies as a liberal feminist and bases her philosophy on liberalism (Locke, Rawls, Sen). And just from my personal perspective, I am not sure radical feminists disagree with Martha Nussbaum and let's say a first wave liberal feminist like Mary Wallestonecraft as much as they do queer theorists. So do radical feminists consider queer theory to be liberal feminism?",1
"Why is there such a negative connotation behind ""straight white cis males""?","I identify as a straight white cis male, and I like to think that I'm extremely progressive in my views.

How did you experience your first periods and what did you wish you were told?,"I'm doing a project on menstruation aimed at figuring out a way to make it easier, safer and less scary for young girls to learn about and deal with their first periods. For this I'm looking to gather information on how women of all ages experienced their first periods and that stage in life. I'd like to know how you learned about it, when you learned about it (before or after your first period, if, what and how you were explained on the topic, whether you received external help at all,...). Whether you experienced it as a frightening thing or if you felt safe and understood. And specifically what you feel could have made it easier on you.

For me there was a certain taboo that I felt around it. We had one sex ed class which was very graphic and confusing, and that sudden information, coupled with the embarassement I felt with all the boys in the room joking and being grossed out literally made me vomit and cry. In my family the conversation was pretty limited. Both my mother and father tried to be positive and supportive about it, yet seemed to want to end the conversation quickly. I felt like I went through it pretty much alone because of that and would only talk to my mother about it if I was really scared about something. I'd love to have had the relationship back then (that I do have now) where it was just a normal conversational topic.",1
"Is being ""Cis"" a priviledge?","I had a discussion with my friend, she told me ""cis priviledge"" doesn't exist.

What's your local music scene like? What are your experiences?,"I suppose this is more of a pre-pandemic question, but how would you describe the music scene in your area? Are there other feminists? Are promoters clear about their stance on abuse and harassment, and do venues have safer space policies? Are there people who initiate or attempt restorative justice after something has happened?

I was involved in the local punk/metal scene for almost 10 years and was on the receiving end of misogynistic bullshit from both men and women. Hating on women for how much sex they had and what kind of sex they had was the norm, and it was very much a huge clique. People talked shit about other women behind their back then would turn around and be super friendly to them at shows‚Äîit was sickening. 

One white woman would make comments to me, a eurasian femme, about how small my tits were, and how she could never not shave her pits like me, or not remove her upper lip hair, all the while holding events for ""women supporting women."" 

I was touched inappropriately countless times at events and would post about it on social media, telling people to keep their hands to themselves.  Others did this too. It seemed like every six months there was some musician being called out for being abusive, but nothing changed. 

One prominent metal promoter never spoke up about how harassment wouldn't be tolerated at his events, nor attempted to implement a safer spaces policy. In fact, he still supported a band even after the lead singer had groped a woman at a show of his. I guess it's not surprising behaviour considering he played in a band with a rapist.

I had to remove myself from the scene entirely. It's super disappointing to love a particular genre of music but be driven out of a community for it's hatred toward women and bro-code culture.",1
Is it appropriate to compliment a woman at the beach?,"I was talking to my boyfriend earlier cause he brought up the subject, we were talking about complimenting women in public, he said if he saw a woman on the beach and thought she was good looking (and wasn‚Äôt dating me) he thinks it‚Äôs appropriate to go up to her and tell her she looks good. I told him if I was at the beach in a bikini and some guy I don‚Äôt know came up to me and complimented my body I would be very uncomfortable. He said if it‚Äôs in a public place (including the beach) then it‚Äôs okay, I said I would feel uncomfortable if I‚Äôm wearing bathers, I should be able to go to the beach and wear bathers without being looked at and commented on. If I‚Äôm at the beach and everyone else is in bathers I‚Äôm good with that but once I‚Äôve been singled out by a stranger I feel vulnerable and uncomfortable.

He also asked if a woman came up to me and complimented me how would I feel and I said I‚Äôd be fine with that, he said that‚Äôs unfair and that women can be just as dangerous as men to other women, I said sure, but it‚Äôs a whole lot less likely so I‚Äôm comfortable with it.

"Informed Consent matters, why aren't minors who lie about their age considered rapists?","Informed Consent is an important factor of consent that both parties know what they're getting into and who they're getting intimate with. Someone who had sex with someone under the pretenses of a condom being present, did not consent to sex with the condom secretly off. Likewise for impersonation of another person.

The issue of a minor lying to get with an adult they're attracted to is an issue for adults of all genders and sexual orientations. Gay men and lesbian women also suffer from this issue as there are [reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/j8z9qs/psa_dont_lie_about_your_age_i_almost_hooked_up/) about it being an issue on their respective dating apps as well.

In these cases the adult consented to sex with someone who they believed to be an adult, they would not have had sex with the minor otherwise. Adults who are victim to this genuinely feel sickened and violated that they were manipulated into having sex with a child, an entirely different persona than the one presented.

The adult did not have informed consent, so why is a lying minor absolved of rape? From a feminist perspective, would lying about age dramatically changing one's personhood from minor to adult, violate informed consent?",1

I‚Äôve grown out my hair for multiple weeks, occasionally even a couple of months, and felt good about it; really good about it. 

No matter how long I go and how proud I am of my beautiful hair, there is always something that makes me feel that I need to shave.

Is it inappropriate to note someone's pronouns before using them if you think they would cause confusion?,"There is a person in my extended social circle who uses he/her pronouns.  This can cause a modest amount of confusion for people who don't usually interact with him, as when we talk about her and he goes from the subject to the direct object of a sentence, people think that the ""her"" we are referring to is a different person.

This has lead to a weird situation in which we've found it helpful to clarify the ""he/her pronoun"" situation before talking about this person, but others have objected saying that it's kind of rude since we would never go out of our way to mention someone else's pronouns instead of just using them naturally.

I know feminist circles tend to have a good sense of the best practices with regards to pronoun usage, so I was wondering if anyone here has come across a similar situation, and if so, how did you approach it?",1
What do you think of this news? Do you agree with the government or not?,"Paris city authorities have been fined for employing too many women in senior positions, a decision mocked as ""absurd"" by mayor Anne Hidalgo on Tuesday. The **fine of 90,000 euros**(US$110,000) was demanded by France's public service ministry on the grounds that Paris city hall had broken national rules on gender parity in its 2018 staffing.

""I am happy to announce that we have been fined,"" Hidalgo told a city council meeting, adding she had been filled with ""joy"" when she learned of the penalty.

**Hidalgo said she was faulted because 11 women and only five men were named to management positions in city hall in 2018, meaning that 69 percent of the appointments went to women.**

""The management of the city hall has, all of a sudden, become far too feminist,"" laughed the Socialist, who was re-elected for a new term at the helm of Paris last year. According to the text of the ruling cited by Le Monde daily, city hall violated a rule dating to 2013, which stipulates said one sex should not account for more than 60 of nominations to management positions. Hidalgo said that she would take the cheque for the fine to the government in person, along with her deputy mayors and all the women working for her.

Taking a more serious tone, she added: ""Thi**s fine is obviously absurd, unfair, irresponsible and dangerous**"", adding that women in France should be promoted with ""vigour because the lag everywhere in France is still very great"".

""Yes, **to one day achieve parity, we must speed up the tempo and ensure that more women are appointed than men**,"" she said",1
Is Toy Story a good allegory for the loss of privilege?,"I know it isn't a perfect 1-to-1 because ultimately Andy is trading one masculine symbol for another buuuut in regards to Woody it seems actually pretty fitting. He's in an unchallenged position of leadership. when the move is happening he points out that he isn't worried about being replaced or abandoned therefore others shouldn't be  and it is rightly pointed out that...no shit Woody has no reason to be afraid. He's Andy's favorite. He is the basis and hero in all of Andy's stories. The other toys are but a part of his story and their importance is only in relation to how much they serve that purpose. He gets more representation than anyone else as Andy's room is full of his merch. So he will naturally walk around secure in the knowledge that he'll be okay. 

Enter Buzz who suddenly becomes the new toy on the block. Woody gets played with less and when he does it's in service to Buzz's story. Andy's room is redecorated to a new aesthetic that is in direct contrast to the old southern wild wild west. More people are excited to listen and defer to Buzz. Woody still has authority but it's not nearly as prevalent and it drives him up the wall. He's no longer special. He's ""just another toy""

What's your view of single-sex schools? Why are they legal?,"Hi :)

I'm from the UK and we have many more same sex schools than across the pond, but I've never really understood why tf we have them. I've always hated them -  there not representative of the real world and your at risk of producing some really weird personalities that are alienated from the real world (particularly private same-sex schools) - and I've always assumed that feminists hate them too, given feminism is all about sex equality. It's weird because it's literally segregation so I don't really see a moral case for them, but I'd really like to know if there are any feminists (or anyone at all, for that matter) who genuinely agrees with them. And what's really baffling to me, is how they are legal?? In the UK, we have the Equality Act 2010, which reads  'A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if, because of a protected characteristic, A treats B less favourably than A treats or would treat others. '  Now if I'm not wrong, don't same-sex schools do literally what's described there e.g I can't go to an all-girls school because I'm male, and sex is a protected characteristic so...? I know in the US you have your constitution, and surely US same-sex schools (albeit the small amount) are unconstitutional - 'all men (bit dodgy, but I'm interpreting it as everyone) are created equal'. So, particularly any lawyers out there, how are they legal/constitutional? Is there an exemption or some weird loophole?

Some advice about how to deal with men purporting to be feminists.,"I‚Äôm close friends with a woman whose husband has been physically, emotionally and sexually abusive for the vast majority of their relationship.

I am asking whether it is even possible to give the benefit of the doubt. whether democracy can work. I am questioning standpoint epistemology. I am wondering if communication is possible.

I do not want to get into the arguments. because, this is besides the real point, and I don't want to get into people flinging trauma at each other either. the point is, I am introspective. I am educated. I have gone to therapy. But I disagree.

It is a problem I myself am wrestling with. a problem of commensurability. a problem of censorship. a problem of being able to participate in civic space.

What is the response to this? Because if we can't figure this out, and we go on as we are, in society... water wars, will not just be between india and china.

I want to be on the side of democracy. But it seems as though it is not working. as with Kalithecat's response, I think it was Simone Veil that said something like ""recognition is the rarest form of compassion""

How do I deal with my ex wanting to date women?,"Hello, I identify as male with he/him pronouns, and a few months ago my ex broke up with me because she felts like she wanted to start seeing women. It was certainly difficult to leave, but if that's what makes her happy than I support her efforts. You only have one life, right? However, as time went on I've felt sort of scared of the idea of seeing her with someone else. I know that we're over and she wants to explore her sexuality and all this stuff, but I keep thinking of scenarios where we would hang out, and then she'd find someone, and it would be very awkward. I'm scared this awkward feeling is homophobia. If she were to start dating a woman, I'd think it would be hard for me to get used to the idea right away. I've never had a problem with people who have sexualities outside of the heteronormative practice, nor ever felt any animosity towards them. And I still love my ex very much, as both a human being and my best friend. I keep vacillating between whether my feelings are valid or not, and if they are prejudicial in nature. I keep wondering if its a result of implicit bias that makes me uncomfortable. If this is a case of homophobia, I want to do whatever it takes to get over it because I still want to be her friend, no matter the workload and harsh truths that I will have to go through. Its difficult to know their is a prejudicial side to myself, but I know prejudices can be overcome and my relationships will be much more closer because of it. I just find it difficult to accept my ex being with someone else while I still would like to be her friend. How should I think about this situation, and what can I do?",1
Slut-shaming other women - how do you react?,"A short backstory: Recently I have watched some videos on YouTube why feminism is still needed. I have been always aware that women around the world are treated unequally. However, as a young teenager living in Europe, I somehow though that there is no discrimination towards women in my country, at least in my environment. Oh boy, I was so wrong on so many levels.

But what recently caught my attention was how people treat women who are promiscuous. 

The first time that I really thought about this aspect was when I was around 16 years old. There was this ‚Äúconservative‚Äù female friend who was telling me about party she went to during weekend. She simply slut-shamed one girl just ‚Äúbecause she went with a random boy alone to the bedroom‚Äù. I really felt that what she said was inappropriate and disrespectful. Firstly, she didn‚Äôt know what they were doing. Secondly, it‚Äôs still none of her business. And thirdly, she named this girl ‚Äúa whore‚Äù while not mentioning the boy at all. Back then I couldn‚Äôt really understand why I was so upset by her words. Now I know it is the fact that she used such words to describe other girl, only because she potentially could have made out with someone. 

What is even more worrying, I know many girls from my school who claim themselves to be feminists and to fight for women‚Äôs rights. The problem is their attitude towards other females who are promiscuous. I‚Äôve heard many times as they said -  ‚Äúshe is slutty‚Äù or ‚Äúshe‚Äôs whore‚Äù. As long as you don‚Äôt do harm to the other person (meaning someone didn‚Äôt force themselves or didn‚Äôt cheat on somebody), I don‚Äôt understand the need for calling other women in such way. 

Two year later, I remember being on parties in which there was a particular boy who liked to flirt with other girls. Each time there was a party, he would get drunk and try to make out with someone. I didn‚Äôt think of it much as I believe it is none of my business. However, several weeks after one party he told how one girl was slutty (she and him were only kissing each other). I laughed in my mind because I couldn‚Äôt believe what he had just said. It was fine for him to call a female in a harmful manner, while he‚Äôs doing the same thing on every party. It was sheer hypocrisy, and this was the moment that I realized women are certainly not treated the same way that men are, even in those smallest aspects of social life. 

No one would call a male being slutty but rather as a player etc. Somehow for males being promiscuous equals to being successful (and btw I think that it‚Äôs toxic too). But when a female is promiscuous, she is described with extremely negative words. It is worrying that not only males make such comments, but women too, even though we are supposed to support each other. 

I have questions to you. Have you experienced situations in which promiscuous females were treated or talked in a negative way? How did you respond? How do you react to people who talk this way?

I think this issue is quite important because calling a female ‚Äúa slut‚Äù can drastically changer her change, especially for teenagers who are entering some part of adulthood.",1
What is feminism (to high school boys),"Straight dude here, and proud member of my high school‚Äôs feminism club. A lot of my friends are also straight dudes with a less than positive view of feminists, due in part to memes and the occasional story about crazy, aggressive feminists they‚Äôve read on the internet.

"Do feminists consider the WCTU, the WONPR and other pro and anti- probation movements to be feminist and what are your overall views on them?","These movements were mostly made up of women who took part in protesting, something looked down upon back then and fought against alcoholism and prohibition,something that impacted women negatively, making it seem that it is a feminist movement. However, most of the movement was Christian, which many feminists from my understanding dislike, and wasn‚Äôt focused primarily on women‚Äôs rights. Was the movement feminist or was it something else?",1
Is it sexist to ask your husband to be your house wife?,"I‚Äôm genuinely wondering. I have this idea in my mind that when I‚Äôm older. I‚Äôll be Richard Gilmore and I‚Äôll have an Emily by my side. (I‚Äôm female) It sounds nice to me. However, on another sub a woman asked the same spurt of question and got a lot of hate for it. I‚Äôve told my current boyfriend if we get married, that‚Äôs what I want. He‚Äôs perfectly happy with that, loves it actually. But other males who have found out that I‚Äôve asked him of that got deeply offended on his behalf.

Edit: I wrote ‚Äúhouse wife‚Äù in error. That‚Äôs on me. I mean, homemaker/house husband.",1
Is Genshin impact sexist?,"Hi! I am playing the game Genshin impact for a while now and I really wanted to ask if it is a  game that is concidered as sexist (sorry for my bad English by the way ) because what I like about it is that for example Jean, a female character, is a the Grandmaster of the knights of favonius. Or that for example mona is an astrologist  wich is a typical male job, same with Beidou. Because i am not sure about if its feminist or not and I dont want to like something that is sexist.",1

"Where did the ‚Äúoh my (female relative/friend/ acquaintance) said it was okay, therefor it‚Äôs not casual sexism or misogyny‚Äù belief come from? And How can we eradicate it?","I‚Äôve noticed far too often when being ask why they thought a sexist joke or remark is okay, men will reply with ‚Äúmy wife said it was funny‚Äù or ‚Äúmy female friend said it‚Äôs fine‚Äù as if one individual speaks for all women. I would like to add these are cases in which the joke/ remark actually was offensive, rather than grey area. 


I see two issues:

1. Possibly women not being honest with male friends / family members and claiming to be okay with things they aren‚Äôt okay with. 

2. The unfortunate belief that a women can‚Äôt be a misogynist or sexist because she is a women. 

I wonder if the men using these excuses genuinely believe ‚Äúoh a women has said it‚Äôs okay therefore it is‚Äù, or if it‚Äôs just that, an excuse that sounds more credible, a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù? 
Are misogynistic women actually more of an issue than we like to believe? Or are these women simply people who are too anxious to speak up around their male friends or partners? (I can imagine it‚Äôs not always easy to tell people what they‚Äôve said isn‚Äôt right)",1
Is criticizing terf women's opinions wrong?,"There was this post in Facebook of someone defending a mysoginistic woman who is also a famous youtuber. She has a past of being anti-lgbt and aggressive towards women in general and being violent towards her ex husband (she admitted threatening him with a knife multiple times) 

I don't think this behavior is acceptable, but this person was saying that our feminism should defend these aggressors, this woman as well. That this is sorority. So I made a comment about this not being okay, and I receive tons of comments saying that I should respect this opinion, that I'm attacking this woman by saying that her opinion is bullshit. 

So if I don't get terf opinions, do you think is wrong if I decide to criticize them?

How to change parents views on their daughters? (I am male homeroom/science teacher),"So I have been working in a girls-only school for the last three years. And now that I have direct communication with the student's families, I understand how incomplete is to work on body-positivity, sexual rights, promotion towards STEM fields, or prevention of violence with the girls if the families are pulling the other way around. I will put an example to make myself clear: in one teacher-parents meeting, I shared my worries on emotional  health of the student and one of the mother's replies was that it is o that the girl's worries about her body, because she was getting fatter. Or in this other meeting another mother ""denounced"" how the other ""sluts"" of her daughter's grade were already having sex (they are 16 y/o). 

Mostly this type of situation happens with the mothers of my students (mothers are usually the caregivers of my students and the one to go to the school to talk with me, because ""dad's working for proving to the house"" ) , which makes thing twice complicated. I mean,  I feel I have to intervene so how, but those are their daughters, but the violences is there, but I feel I am mansplainning feminist theory to an adult female (the mothers).  So, any advice? Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my mother tounge.

Shouldn‚Äôt masturbating / fantasizing about someone require consent? [LONG READ],"A NOTE ON CONTENT: Nothing sexually graphic is mentioned, though there is discussion of sexual activities and consent. 

**TL;DR - When someone other than yourself is involved in a sexual act with you, that other person must provide consent. Masturbation is a sexual act. Masturbation fantasies involve a person other than yourself (albeit indirectly) in the sexual act of masturbating. Since there is another person involved in a sexual act, shouldn‚Äôt that person give their consent to be masturbated to / fantasized about?**


Full disclosure: I‚Äôm a cishet male. My own understanding on consent is limited and still growing, and I think this is one of the best places to ask. If there‚Äôs other places on Reddit or the internet that such a question would be better directed, please let me know, and I apologize in advance if I‚Äôve crossed any lines. 


EDIT: I‚Äôve looked at other posts on this subreddit and just thought I‚Äôd clarify this from the start: I‚Äôm not talking about masturbating to photos or videos of people but just fantasizing about them to yourself. Masturbating to pictures, if those pictures were not taken with the explicit intention of providing a template for sexual fantasy, is an act of objectification and is thus inherently demeaning. My question just regards fantasizing and masturbating to oneself, no pictures or any other materials present, and the extent that consent should apply. 

With that said:

[Healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/health/guide-to-consent#what-is-consent) has, what I think to be, a sufficient definition of consent, that is ‚ÄúConsent is a voluntary, enthusiastic, and clear agreement between the participants to engage in specific sexual activity.‚Äù 

Further, I understand masturbation to be an inherently sexual act (and I think others would agree with me on this stance). 

Masturbation is also an activity that often, if not always, leads to fantasizing about someone in a sexual manner. Because masturbating is an act of self-stimulated orgasm, by definition, the person being fantasized about during masturbation not be *directly* involved in the act itself. That is, the person being fantasized about is not physically causing nor stimulating the orgasm. **However**, they are still *involved* in the act, are they not? Their involvement is indirect, in the form of being fantasized and thought about during masturbation, rather than physical involvement, but it‚Äôs involvement nonetheless, right? 

**With that in mind, since masturbation is a sexual act that involves another person, shouldn‚Äôt the other person have to consent to be masturbated to / fantasized about (as per the definition of consent)?**

I‚Äôve read stances along the lines of ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre masturbating to them, then it‚Äôs alright.‚Äù But then again, what if someone were masturbating to someone else in a public space, without the subject of the masturbation knowing they were in the center of someone‚Äôs fantasy? Though the person doesn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre being masturbated to, surely such an act violates consent since the subject‚Äôs lack of awareness of the situation prevents any consent from being given?

Now, I‚Äôd just like to personally add that I‚Äôm asking tjis question because I‚Äôve masturbated to both people I know, and celebrities that I find attractive. Yet, regardless of if I know them or not, I do not want to deprive them of their consent, even if they don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm masturbating to them. I try not to masturbate to any pictures that I find on the internet, as most of the time such images were not taken with the intention of providing a source of sexual fantasy, and I don‚Äôt want to reduce their identities by disregarding the photo‚Äôs intent and looking at it only in a sexual light. Any fantasizing is kept to myself, though, again, even if it is kept to myself, I don‚Äôt want to deprive anyone of consent with my actions. 

Thank you for reading and any an all responses are appreciated.

EDIT 2: To be honest, I was expecting this to get no comments. So even the few I‚Äôve received I‚Äôm very grateful for, and all with incredible insights. Thank you all!",1
how do u visualize the beauty dilemma that women face in society and do u believe the commodification of women bodies is a form of liberation or oppression for women?,,1
Misuse of verbage.,"Why is it that on most pages or posts involving feminism, the terms misogyny, sexist, oppressed, etc. are all used either incorrectly or simply as an attack on any males who dont agree?    (Im not saying all feminists are like this, i just tend to see alot of them).",1
Are the events of 2020 throwing us into the fourth wave of feminism?,"As far as I understand, basically: first wave is suffragists around 1910-1920, second wave is around 1960-1970 with the womens lib movement, third wave is 1990s(ish?) with more intersectionality, and the only thing ive heard about fourth wave is that its pretty much the same as third wave but with social media? 

At first I thought if its the same how does adding social media make a whole new wave when we already had the internet when the third wave started? I know social media has had a strong affect on our society both good and bad. Is it because of the #s? #metoo and #blm are obviously very important in as historical social movements

But now in 2020 we are kinda forced to use only internet based/social media platforms during quarantine? So Im thinking that fourth wave might be a more relevant label for whats happening currently after coronavirus.

I also want to acknowledge the fact that I'm in the US, my historical knowledge and current situation is based on that. In other countries apparently its like the pandemic never even happened haha.",1
Where to stand on women that men cheat with?,"To me personally, if the woman didn‚Äôt know, then the man who cheated is definitely solely to blame.  If she knew, then I go as per the saying ‚Äúit takes two to tango.‚Äù  As the saying literally means that-they both dug their grave.  

Blaming *only* the woman (or multiple women) in either instance while letting the man who cheated off scot free is no doubt internalized misogyny (hello Cardi B).  However, despite that being the common case for long, I am at odds with the idea that the woman a man cheated with should be scot free even if she knew because she didn‚Äôt owe the man‚Äôs gf/wife a commitment.  I‚Äôd argue she still owed the gf/wife basic decency/courtesy and empathy/consideration.  

I also don‚Äôt believe feminism means excusing selfish behavior of individual women.  Plus, in instances where the gf/wife knew the other women well, it‚Äôs understandable that she feels betrayed by both her bf/husband and the other woman.  In my experience, women who knowingly engage in affairs with other women‚Äôs bfs/husbands tend to have the most internalized misogyny along with all other sorts of bigotry (personally my own stepmother is a prime example).  

I‚Äôve seen different feminists have different views on this, so I‚Äôd like to see where the feminists of Reddit stand.",1
"What do Feminists think of the ""Silver Bullet""?","What is the, ""Silver Bullet?""

Edit: I guess that answers that question. Feminist would rather ignore the problem and claim anyone suffering from sexism in the divorce industry is biased themselves. Cool.

&gt;It goes like this: At the inception of a divorce, one parent falsely accuses the other of abusing them or their children and claims they believe it will happen again. Depending on the country and jurisdiction, it might only take an affidavit of a couple of pages. No evidence or corroborating witnesses are needed, due process be damned. Now the police will arrive and haul the targeted parent out of the matrimonial home with protective orders, offering scant access to immediate legal recourse. What he or she says in their own defense is rarely of any significance. From this point forward, they are unlikely to see their children again for days, weeks, months, and sometimes [years](https://vancouversun.com/news/crime/father-seeks-justice-after-sons-abduction?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR2ng_h5Uz8DUA4LW0zbm0zgETve6uAIHrEUtcnHl60BFD1gyRymhbM7fwA#Echobox=1554675661).

Is Grayson a non sexist way of doing power fantasy/spy fiction?,"Hey I want to write a spy story and most of my influences come from Bond.  And I'm kinda realizing how problematic that is.  But I've recently read Grayson which I'm thinking I can draw from a bit less problematicly?


Like the issue with Bond is:

The use of Bond Girls as just eye candy with no characterization 

His treatment of said women 

The lack of female rep until like Quantum of Solace

The racist and homophobic caricatures of the villains ect.

Probably some transphobia there too

Alot of imperialism 



I dont think Grayson has any of that and hope to God I dont write any in, but is it a better place to draw spy fiction from, especially escapist spy fiction.

Also the sex between characters is that better suited?

Like what's a better way to write no strings sex or a better view of sex in spy fiction in general?

Thank you for the time.",1

Arguments to support believing victim.,"My high school had a MeToo recently. Many boys getting called out did not sit well with most of the male population. Their foremost argument, as always, was that anyone can make allegations without evidence. Most of the posts were self anecdotal cases. There were a few anonymous posts as well where someone would send first or second hand accounts, the poster will label them as such. While discussing the whole thing with my friends, the arguments that I brought up for believing the victims were:

*  No. of false allegations as a percentage is so small you can ignore it, especially if you take into account the number of cases that go unreported.
* You can't prove a lot of cases as there is no hard evidence but that doesn't mean the victim is lying. I gave the analogy that if I'm alone with one of you and I hit you hard without leaving any marks. You go complain to the authorities, who ask for evidence which you can't provide so you're obviously lying. Do you see the issue? How difficult it is to always produce evidence? Then there's also the mishandling of evidence.
* Victims have a lot to deal with when calling someone out. Recalling might trigger unpleasant memories. They have to face societal pressure. They are slut shamed. They are called liars and attention seekers. They are gaslight. They got more to lose than gain by falsely accusing someone for personal benefit so highly unlikely someone will suffer all that.
* ""Anyone can bring up an allegation against me"" To which I said, if you haven't done anything, you shouldn't be worried. Nobody has falsely accused me or you guys means they aren't on some sort of agenda to defame all men.

After a few posts, anonymous posts were stopped as the authenticity of such posts couldn't be completely determined and a few doubtful cases did slip in so the girls said they won't be taking anonymous posts, even though it does silence those who want to remain anonymous, as they can't do due diligence. These cases were used to bring up the whole false allegations argument and counter victim having to lose as they were behind a virtual wall now.

1) What other reasons can I provide to further bolster my argument? If anyone of the reasons I provided above are problematic, please explain how to correct them.

2) What are your views on anonymous posting? Should they have continued to be allowed despite the authenticity issue? 

3) Many boys argued that judgement was already passed without allowing the accused to defend themselves. Should the accused be allowed present their defence? 

4) In some cases, the accused provided very private conversations and digital evidence in their defence. Many argued that is a violation of privacy of the victim, while others said the accused have a right to defend. Views on this (I personally agree with the former)?

5) Extending (4), there was one particular case where a guy was accused on an all girls group but the whole student body got to know about it. He posted above type of evidence in the bigger group. The argument against this was that since the victim never posted on the bigger group, he shouldn't have either. His defence was that doesn't matter as everyone already knew by then. Can his reason be justified?

6) A bit unrelated to the post, but I read that we should call victims, survivors instead. I have seen the use of the term 'victim' here, so what to understand if it's okay to use it?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, please suggest some reading materials related to the MeToo movement, to understand it from the victim's perspective.",1
"The danish law against FGM is much harsher than most other countries, in that it bans any type of labiaplasty even on consenting adults.

Allegedly there is a sort of loophole in that it is somewhat easy to get a  medical certificate from your doctor to get it done anyway, but this requires you to go and say that you feel either physically or emotionally impaired by your genitalia.

It's also important to point out that even without this law, FGM would still be completely illegal due to other laws against mutilation, which also would prevent anyone from getting their testicles or hands cut off regardless of their age and claims of consent.",1

Getting married/Having a child as a feminist?,"Hi all,

I am a feminist with a radical leaning and also an environmentalist. I am in my early 30s and about to get married (humanist elopement) to my SO. I never dreamt of getting married nor having children, even before I identified as a feminist. I am still not 100 % sure about why I am getting married as I am also not religious (surprise, surprise) but I guess it's because my partner asked and I am willing to make this commitment to him. I am not taking his last name though.

As mentioned I have almost zero desire to have kids. Pregnancy, child birth, losing my independence, climate change, feeling like I'd be conforming to patriarchal ideas of what it means to be a woman etc.  just make me extremely reluctant to having a child. But then there is a tiny part that thinks what if I'll regret it? It doesn't help that historically I am the kind of person who just really hates conforming and likes to rebel - the more people talk to me about having children and how that will give me purpose and meaning (I have an extremely purposeful and meaningful career and helping the planet is more important to me than perpetuating my genes), the more I will dig my heels in.

I am aware that feminism is about giving women the choice to do what they feel is best and I rather dislike the fact I am so antagonistic toward motherhood.

"The ""divorce financially destroys men"" myth - where did it come from?","I still see the idea that divorce financially ruins men (and the implication: it doesn't hurt women) come up *a lot* despite the data showing that [men are financially better off after divorce than women are.](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/25/divorce-women-research) People seem to treat it as some sort of conventional wisdom without any evidence to support it. To be honest, divorce sucks for a lot of people, but the financial aspect does not disproportionately impact men; the opposite is true. 

So where do you think this whole trope comes from?

Oh, and the other thing that's always thrown around: ""The man loses half of his stuff in divorce!"" Like... that's not how it works. Joint assets in the marriage are divided. Not just ""his stuff."" Not just ""her stuff."" It's like some men fail to see marriage as a partnership at all.

I am misogynist for stopping my gf from meeting certain men?,"The reason I chose to post this question here rather than an advice subreddit is that I want to understand if my thinking stems from misogyny, which I doubt I'll be able to understand there.

To give you some context, my gf is a very friendly and kind women. She manages to see good in people who don't even deserve an ounce of kindness. Over the years, I've stopped her from going to some events, like going out for drinks with co-workers where no other girl is present, and meeting certain guy friends/co-workers alone.

The reason behind this isn't that I'm insecure, there are a few guy friends of hers that I can blindly trust to not hurt her. Even if they have feelings for her doesn't mean she feels the same and will end up cheating on me. I don't fear her catching feelings for someone else, if that's going to happen then though luck for me but the mature thing is to accept that people fall out of love and forcing someone to love you is toxic. Besides, since I love her, I'd want what makes her happy, not miserable.

I tell her not go to these things or meet these men for her safety. Given how rampant harassment and violence against women are, I fear her getting hurt. Even if she takes care of her self, these men can take advantage of her, spike her drink, force her, physically overpower her. I don't stop her from going out in general, even if at night, or even with some guys I trust as I aforementioned. I won't say the only way to stop harassment/violence is to not go out, that's not a solution. It's just better to avoid certain people you think can hurt you. Moreover, it's just certain men that I think are creepy that I don't want her meeting alone, heck, I'd trust strangers more. I'd be okay with her chilling with them if, say, I am around or some of our trustable guy/girl friends are.

I don't forcibly stop her, ~~I just tell her not to go and she listens~~ (I tell her these people aren't good based on the evidence I give for the claim. She agrees with how that is indeed bad. I am well aware she can go if she wants to and won't stop her.

Recently I was explaining the same to a friend of hers who said that my reasons stem from a misogynistic way of thinking as I am another guy trying to control his female partner.

Edit: correct title should start with ""am I"". Currently it looks like I am been sarcastic.

Edit2: changed some wording which made it look like I was commanding her.

Edit3: I am going to set away now. Despite my post not being able to properly explain what I was trying to say, I did see some issues being highlighted in the comments that I was missing. I will reflect on those. Thank you for your responses! ",1
Question regarding boundaries and other people's kink,"I was just reading a post on AITA about a girl whose mother would wear a BDSM collar and call her husband ""Sir"" in front of her throughout her childhood, and the mom recently informed the daughter (20) that this was part of a Dominant/Submissive lifestyle. The daughter was repulsed to learn about her parents kink and felt that her boundaries have been violated. Most of the commenters were calling her an asshole for kink shaming her mom. 

I don't know how I feel about this situation because to me it seems like the parents were exposing their child to  their kink without her consent, especially after the daughter found out the signification of the collar and express extreme discomfort with it. That being said, some commenters were comparing it to a wedding ring, saying the kink is not inherently sexual. I'm wondering what you guys think is the line between respecting people's boundaries, vs respecting people's freedom to express their lifestyle.

(I know this isn't a specifically feminist issue, but since sexual consent is often discussed here I thought I'd ask)",1
How can a guy convince his fiancee not take his name?,"So, I have a buddy who is engaged to be married and he believes that it is oppressive a woman to take her husbands name. 

He feels strongly about it and im not sure that there's anything that can change his mind on the issue.

The problem is that his fiancee absolutely wants to take his last name and is offended by the suggestion that they should each keep their family names. Apparently, she had a mug custom made with the words Mrs. [His name] printed on it. 

From my understanding, she is a die hard feminist. So it's super confusing that she would want to take his name. 


Anyways. I can't seem to come up with any arguments for why they should keep their own names besides the ones that he has already offered to her. 

He doesn't like the history of the practice and what it represents. I've suggested that he offer to take hers but he likes his last name and doesn't want to change it.  He's also is kind of a stickler for fairness and thinks that it is unfair for one spouse to take the others as it creates a ""Power imbalance"". 

I don't understand relationships in general. So I'm making the smart decision and looking to Reddit for answers lol

Any advice on how a man can convince his fiancee that it's not right for her to change her name to his?

Some questions.,"Is it okay to accept an engagement ring from a man which he has paid for? And to live in a house that is completely paid for by the man, and have the privilege to take the whole house in case of divorce. If the man also hires and pays for a housekeeper \[thereby eliminating the unpaid labor \] in that case isn't marriage a system only beneficial for women?

Then, are pre-nups offensive to women \[Statistically it is women who almost exclusively practice hypergamy, so only a small percentage of women would be richer than their males spouse\]?

If there are such extreme failings on part of men, why don't women start dating women and marrying women, since feminism says that sexuality is a spectrum? I mean, why spend so much time crticising and analysing things instead of becoming bisexual, nobody is stopping you from doing that now.  Also women would know how to pleasure other women better and since penetrative sex does not guarantee female orgasm, so wouldn't you be better off with a woman?

Also, why do you think asian countries don't care about feminism?",1
"Why should I not be offended by the statement ""I've got 99 problems and the white heteronormative patriarchy is basically all of them""?","My feminist sisters are frequently posting this sort of thing on their Facebook stories and news feeds and I am told that I'm not supposed to take this personally. Being that I am white, straight, and male, I don't see how I could take this as anything other than a personal insult.

Why don't we have stricter penalties for rape?,"Increasing prison time will bring down the number of rapes, as men will be more afraid of committing rapes and going to jail for a long time. I think some countries also have death penalty for rape? Some Islamic countries cut off arms or something - but they also oppress women so we should not follow them.

Also, I am curious about difference between rape culture and like murder culture? . Obviously like making punishment severe will bring number of rapes down, but can we completely eradicate it? \[Like even in advanced countries people still commit murder even if jail time is very high\].",1
"What, as a feminist, is your view on NSFW games?","I have found myself playing a lot of lewd/erotic visual novel games lately. I've realized that most of them are terrible, but there are a few that actually have a very fleshed-out story and interesting characters on top of the sexual content.

Diversity and Entertainment.,"I do not understand why people want to force diversity everywhere?  Like just recently with Netflix's Winx Club adaptation - they do not even look like teenagers. . Also other things too like Enola Holmes \[why ride on the coat tails of an already iconic character? Arthur Conan Doyle did not mention an Enola?\] Like create your own female detective or something instead of marring Sherlock Holmes legacy \[I think the Doyle estate have sued Netflix\]. 

Like, actors/entertainers are paid so much because they act in works of fiction that allow you to move away from the boring realities of life, so I think it made logical sense that so many people in the entertainment industry were extremely good looking. Because otherwise - why the hell would I pay money to look at people who look exactly like me and behave exactly like I am - I already am living that life.

I think the next step would be to pay fat salaries to the people graduating at the bottom of the class then, because if rewarding genetic gift of beauty is problematic, it would be hypocritical of human society to reward the genetic gift of intelligence? Also we have a lot of genderbending movies like ghostbuster reboot and oceans reboot which are basically an insult to the original material.",1
Is Madonna considered a big feminist idol just like the gays consider her a gay icon?,Hey! This may be considered a dumb question but I'm a 14 gay male and I have like a MAJOR obsession with Madonna stuff - a lot of older gay guys LOVE her too.

Why does feminism require one to be anti-racist?,"All feminism says is that men and women should be treated equally. It says absolutely nothing about treating all races equally. Theoretically one could support slavery and still be a feminist, as long as they treat the black men slaves equal to the black women slaves, right? Of course, most people would consider such a person deeply immoral, but I don't see how their racism makes them less of a feminist.",1
Does intersectional feminism mean that conservatives like me aren't allowed to be feminists?,"I am a Trump/Brexit/Le Pen supporting type, and also very sympathetic to feminism.  But every time I read feminists online, they seem to keep saying that I'm not allowed to be a feminist, because you can only be a feminist if you believe in radical left-wing social politics, multi-culturalism, etc.

For German speakers, I refer you to this speech:

"" [Teresa B√ºcker √ºber eine feministische Zukunft | 05.02.2020 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyIs3UoUVs) ""

Literally the first line is, ""we can't have anything to do with the AfD or other right-wing parties"", and the general theme is that in order to be a feminist, you have to be left-wing.

This article describes French feminists disavowing Marine Le Pen, saying that she is not allowed to support feminism because she's a fascist:

"" ['We feel very close to her': can 'fake feminist' Marine Le Pen win the female vote? | Marine Le Pen | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/18/front-national-anger-marine-le-pen-female-supporters) ""

I believe that sexual abuse and domestic violence etc are evil and widespread crimes and want to support feminist campaigns against them, but I don't feel able to do so because feminists seem to say that you can't be against those things unless you also support open borders, amnesty for illegals, Remaining in the EU, BLM, anti-capitalism, etc.  So what does that mean?  Am I forbidden from being a feminist?

I think that this is really dangerous.  It seems to me very dangerous to link the campaign against, for example, sexual abuse (which I'm personally a survivor of) with partisan, sectarian politics like immigration/anti-racism - because this is simply a terrible human evil which, like slavery or child labour, every sane person in society should be against.  But it sounds like contemporary feminists demand absolute compliance with a radical left-wing way of thinking as a precondition for supporting any feminist campaigns, like opposition to rape culture and abuse (which is an issue which affects men, too).  So does this mean I can't be against rape?

So what does this mean?  Am I banned from supporting #MeToo because I'm a rightie?  Do I have to oppose equal pay for women?  It sounds like this is what you keep saying to me.",1

So, what is the right thing to do if you have to interact with someone who wears revealing clothes without offending them? Looking at forehead is my reflex action because other wise I would look down and it would make them think that I am creep. I am not a bad person, I don't know why I am uncomfortable.",1

Male Privilege &amp; Sexual Harassment,"Serious question here...no trolling.  My wife is telling me that sexual harassment is part of male privilege.  That does not seem correct to me.  My understanding is that male privilege is about rights that are available to men solely on the basis of their sex, while sexual harassment is not a privilege but an unlawful act.  Before sexual harassment was illegal, I can see where it could have been, but now that it is illegal, I don't see it.  Can someone help me understand it?",1
Should the Age of consent be raised to 21?,"I saw a concerning post on r/feminism about older men targeting high school girls at 16/17 for a relationship. But unfortunately based on where you live this may not be considered illegal. And teens at that age do not have their brains fully developed and can be easily manipulated. In fact the human brain develops till you are around 24. 

Keeping that in mind would it be a good idea to raise the age of consent to protect men from manipulating young women? There is no problem if there are exemptions for near age relationships at around 18-21. 

I would also like to note that South Korea has their age of consent at 20",1
New Army PT test and the negative effects it could have on women,"So some background, I'm 19 years old am a male and I'm in the Army. Now from my definitely brief time in the Army so far I've seen terrible male soldiers and excellent female soldiers, and vice versa. I really do believe that both have equal ability to be combat effective and I would ""go to war"" with whoever is next to me. The Army recently started a new pt test that takes away all sex and age adjustments when it comes to your score. Essentially what that means is everyone has to reach the same numbers depending on the job you have. As of September 84% of females in the Army failed the test (passing is a requirement while in the Army). While 30% of males failed the test as well. The biggest events that females failed on was deadlift and leg tucks (essentially the weirdest mix of a situps and pullup you can imagine). The deadlift minimum requirement is 140 pounds and the minimum requirement for leg tucks is one rep.

All of that and now you're probably wondering what the heck is the point of this post. Well Army leadership, in all their genius, says that this test is superior because it takes everything out of the equation except for your preformance. People that oppose this test say it is extremely discriminatory towards women because of the high fail rates and how men are more likely to pass with less effort. They say it is sexism disguised as ""equal opportunity "". People that support the test say that it doesnt matter what your gender is, it only matters if you can do your job when it cpunts. And that equal opportunity does not always amount to equal results. They also say that these requirements are not difficult to meet and as an Army soldier it is a part of your job to meet what is required. 

This all boils down the question I have. I wanna get the feminist perspective of this issue. Do you think this test is inherently discriminatory towards women? Do you think lowering the standards for women could have even more negative outcomes? ( such as men thinking less of women because they changed the standards for them or something along those lines). Do you think it's more important to have an across the board standard or to adjust based off sex and age?

I'm really curious and honestly don't have a fully formed opinion on the topic yet and I want to get perspectives outside of my buddies.",1

Not to say that the only people I talk to are women I want to hook up with. But this specific person I approached because I liked what I saw.

Maybe my arguments are not that good, but I can't win him over to my point of view.

What are your perspectives on a contentious relationship and how it associates to patriarchy and feminism?,"In straight relationships some men claim that they are at a disadvantage because they feel that the woman has a lot of leverage. Chivalry causes some men to support women in a sexist manner. Whereas Feminism argues patriarchal ideals have put women in a disadvantaged position due oppression. 

This has led certain communities to be skeptical when men claim domestic violence and assume them to be the aggressor. Men worry that in a contentious moment in a relationship woman can essentially pull a DV card to get the men in trouble. 

I understand there are also many communities where the opposite is the case. Where traditional patriarchy has put women in a somewhat submissive position. Essentially treating them like servants. Women in a lot of communities still do an unfair amount of house work as shown by research?

 When women claim abuse they are ignored or their issues are minimized

I personally grew up in a male privileged patriarchal community. I do intend on standing against patriarchy and living in a more equal society. But I do hear a lot of men complaining about false allegations of DV and sexual assault. 

My question is, what is your perspective on this? Do you believe there are communities where men are at a disadvantage? Or do you believe that it‚Äôs rare? How does feminism solve this issue?

This might be an offensive question, I‚Äôm sorry if it is. But is it possible for some woman to take advantage of feminism and chivalry for their own benefit?",1

As a feminist, I love discussing women's issues, solutions, and advocating for all my sisters online. However, whenever I go onto any post, I always see men/some people insulting or saying that it's offensive that we don't talk about men victims or men issues equally.

Or another situation is when you bring up women's issues, and some men start to bring up their issues in retaliation, so forth?

I always feel a little frustrated when I see so many men/people attacking feminism and women of this organization because we don't equally advocate for men's issues with women's issues. It always feels like they'll never understand what the core of feminism really is! 

I understand that they want to see their issues addressed. They are important. Yet, a lot of time I'll see them addressing it is when a woman brings up her issues. And that makes it equally annoying when, yet again, I'm told that I don't advocate for men's issues enough.

What is your opinion on Cyberpunk: 2077?,"As you might've heard, there's been... plenty of controversy surrounding CDPR's new game, Cyberpunk: 2077. From accusations of [transphobia](https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/12/18662443/cyberpunk-2077-trans-advertisement-cd-projekt-red-e3-2019), [misogyny](https://medium.com/@venus.shortfilm/the-representation-of-women-in-cyberpunk-eea332766a7a), to the fiasco surrounding [seizure-enducing visuals](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55231183), there's been a bit of everything.

So I wanted to open up the discussion, as I haven't seen one in here yet. What is your opinion on Cyberpunk: 2077? (This is meant to focus more on the game's messages, themes and social contexts, less on gameplay.)

My personal opinion (I bought it and I'm two hours in):

Transphobia: I'm not very well educated on trans issues, so I can't really comment too much. I do think that the point of the ""Mix It Up""-ad featuring a trans woman is to mock how companies use trans people in ads to show how ""woke"" they are, but fail horribly at it. There's been an interview with the artist, and I think she mentioned that the point was [similar to what I mentioned](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-06-12-a-conversation-with-the-artist-behind-that-cyberpunk-2077-poster). The ""did you just assume their gender!?"" joke made from the Cyberpunk 2077 Twitter account was dumb.

Misogyny: Not too sure about this one, haven't played much yet so I can't really form an opinion.

Epilepsy: They should just patch that imagery out honestly. I don't have epilepsy, but flashing images still make me uncomfortable.

There's probably more controversies, but these seemed to be the biggest ones.

As for gameplay: So far it's pretty fun, though there's bugs. Most visual ones I could fix by updating my GPU drivers. Gameplay bugs I haven't encountered any yet. The gunplay feels a bit odd though.",1

"On women, men, children, and safety: In what ways if any has being a woman made people feel less safe around you?","I'll be frank here. Took me a while to actually pin down what exact question was actually bubbling in my mind. Some context:

I am a 6'2 man. I enjoy going to the gym, I rock some well kept stubble. And I have a smile that makes my cats  mew mew mew.  I also love kids. I like making funny faces at em to make em laugh. I helped raised 4 of my cousins and often babysat growing up.  And one of my favorite things was taking em out to get toys, books, or ice cream. And they ask the most fascinating questions sometimes. Aaand I already feel a bit of unease as I wonder if some of you are asking ""well how much does he like kids?"" which sort of leads into my point.

The reality is that (some) men hurt women. Hurt kids. And it's more than enough to warrant taking precautions. I understand this. I have no desire to bring harm to anyone. But people around me don't know that. What they do know is that IF I wanted to put a woman through a wall or hurt a kid like some monster then I'm physically equipped to do so and thus there's a justifiable suspicion. At times it is a bit frustrating. 

Recently reading about male teachers not being allowed to hug or get close to students for fear of them being predators I think back to some of the awesome dudes who were a real major influence growing up and it just sucks to think that they might have been seen as sus when they got the class ice cream to explain the golden ratio or when my science teacher let me stay over and showed me that trick of setting his hand on fire because he could tell I was having an off day and wanted to show me something cool to cheer me up. You get the picture.  In fact I dealt with it close to a year ago when I took my baby cousin to the park and as I sat on the bench playing with my phone whilst keeping an eye on her I had women looking over my shoulder and giving me the side eye. There were plenty of other women doing the same but I was the one viewed with caution. 

And to be clear, this is not some ""woe is men. Lets give em all the benefit of the doubt"" type post. I KNOW why it is how it is. And far be it from me to place the feelings of a grown ass man over the safety of a woman or child. If I have to go out of my way to make sure I dont accidentally make someone feel unsafe so be it. I'm still more fortunate in that regard than someone who has to carry the fear of being a victim as opposed to being a potential victimizer.  But even acknowledging that...still sucks. No one wants to be associated with monsters. And frick the guys who make these kinds of things necessary in the first place....fucking garbage

Thinking on all this got me wondering if women generally speaking have any situations like this? Situations where they are physically or otherwise perceived as a potential threat in a situation where perhaps a man would be given more leniency and thus have to pre-emptively prove their harmlessness. And I dont mean situations like towards men who are unreasonably fearful of false accusations(although I wonder if the context of men having to prove they are not a threat feeds into that fear but that is not the conversation I'm here to have). Because I know most people, myself included, would generally feel less on edge about a strange woman approaching them or their child than a strange man(Though even in that situation I'd keep my leg muscles warm in case I need to bolt after a female kidnapper as well) . Guess I'm asking if women ever find themselves uniquely seen as the threat because of the actions of other women?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Do women have situations where they are generally more likely to be viewed as a victimizer than a man?",1

Religious beliefs vs feminist rights,"**Trigger Warning: Contains rape/incest

I was recently in a discussion with my very Christian mother. Her and I were arguing about how I feel women get disregarded as trash in American politics (as well as other countries) due to the religious protection many countries hold. Specifically we were discussing a case in the U.S where a young 12 year old girl was repeatedly raped by her older brothers in an Amish community until she became pregnant by one their offspring. 

The two oldest brother who rapped her(out of three only two were considered adults) were not charged with jail time as the prosecutor felt they would be ""torn apart"" in jail. They simply had to pay a fine and go to a class for sexual abusers. Meanwhile, the young girl received no counseling and no protection and the two brothers even broke the restraining order keeping them away from her. She gave birth to the child. 

We fought because in America specifically, religion tends to outweigh the rights if a women. 

Don't get me wrong, I am respectful of everyone's views and beliefs despite it differing than my own. However, I don't feel that that should outweigh that of a living being. There is no proof of a god/ dieti. There is proof of women. Women who are forgotten, abused, and neglected structurally in many countries/political systems. That is what I have a problem with. 

My mother feels that religion should outweigh these issues. How/what issues and evidence can I use to show that women should come first, wayyy before religion ...

Say either you're locked up, or something important to you is on the line. Maybe you're given time to convince a lawmaker to change sexist policies or practices. The point is it's now in your best interest to try and reason with someone who is very much opposed to your position. How might you generally go about doing it?

Advice: Am I over analyzing?,"Hi fellow feminists. I stumbled upon this sub in the process of seeking out advice. I recently received an email from a male colleague in regard to a recent newspaper article published about a project of mine. The article was published in a small town paper where the writing here leaves a little to be desired. When made aware of the article, his response was:

‚ÄúIf you have the opportunity to review in the future prior to publishing I am happy to provide input as well. Might be worth an ask next time.‚Äù

I have a few thoughts. One is that, to my knowledge, that is not how journalism works. And secondly, his response comes off as condescending, implying his input would have made a vastly better end product. I called him out on it, simply stating I appreciated his offer but that he needed to trust that we were sufficiently capable of communicating our project. His response was basically ‚ÄúI think you misunderstood my email.‚Äù But did I? Thoughts? Advice on how to proceed? Thank you for anything you can offer.",1
Feminism and progressive values/conservative feminism,"Another question about the sub's rules and how they pertain to feminism. As the sub is obviously both a space for discussing and by definition a part of feminism, this seems to be a legitimate line of enquiry consistent with the sub's own rules, from what I can understand.

&gt;Direct answers must reflect progressive values, in a strict and consistent manner.

As the requirement is one of strict consistency, why is there no list or link to a list of the aforementioned progressive values? How is strict consistency to progressive values measured and approved, here?

Does this mean that any form of conservative feminism is not considered feminism, here? I asked a question about TERFs here a while back and it didn't seem to be a problem, the post went through and there were responses reflecting a range of opinions on the topic.

Are any of the following list of ""feminisms"" not considered feminism, here, due to failing to be strictly consistent with progressive values?

How do you handle disagreements with other feminists?,"Basically just the title but breaking it into a few sub-questions:

- Is it common that you disagree with something a fellow feminist (or person claiming to be a feminist) says regarding feminism, or with their approach to discussing a feminist issue?
- If/when you do disagree, how do you react? Do you challenge their view directly? Not say anything? Etc?
- Do you notice any difference in your answers to above questions in this community vs in the real world?

I guess what I‚Äôm really asking is, do you find yourself walking a line between fully discussing all angles of an issue and showing support for a person who cares about the same cause as you?",1
Genuinely confused by this.,"*(here comes the obligatory disclaimer): I understand that this is a divisive issue in todays society and that this can cause some people to become agitated and for that i apologise in advance. i also apologise in advance for any and all potential opinions that may cause offense in the comments section due to my asking this question.*

I'm not asking this to upset anyone, I just don't understand. which is it? is gender socially constructed? or is it biologically determined? if its socially constructed then surely it can't be possible to be born in the wrong body as you would have had no interactions with society in order to create any ideas within you. if, on the other hand, its biologically determined then everything that's built on the foundation of social constructionism is built on a fallacy and therefore brings every single concept set on that framework into question. it can't be both. surely its got to be one or the other and I dont buy the whole ""theres a difference between sex and gender"" idea. that kind of cognitive dissonance is not helpful to anyone. 

so that's my question, which is it and why? I'm truly confused by all this.",1

What is your opinion on nature vs nurture in masculine and feminine behaviour?,"I have been met with conflicting ideas on this topic mainly a group claiming that the social environment impacts gender behaviour and it is all learned and another claiming  input from society and biological factors. Example boys and girls raised in gender neutral homes displaying different behaviour. Do you think it is wrong to believe that hormones/genes could affect gender behaviour largely and cause some gender stereotypes? Or has it all been constructed throughout recent humanity?

a quote from wikipedia says this 

As both ""nature"" and ""nurture"" factors were found to contribute substantially, often in an inextricable manner, such views (nature only/nurture only) were seen as naive or outdated by most scholars of human development by the 2000s

Example testosterone and the male aggression stereotype.

Male Fragility,"I have been so close to calling myself a feminist for years, but there are a few things that I can't quite get past. This is one of them.

Why do feminists ridicule men for being ""fragile""? 
We need men and boys to realise that its ok to not be ok. That pretending to be strong is harmful, and that it is ok to be fragile and to cry if you feel like it.

By ridiculing men and boys for being fragile, you encourage them to hide their emotions. By encouraging them to hide their emotions you are up holding the societal structures that conspire to make suicide the leading cause of death for men under 49.",1

But it doesn't seem like there's a huge push in the US to decriminalize the selling of sex. Is this because there's an argument that punishing the victim helps avoid more people from becoming victims of the same? Or is it more of a matter of not agreeing about what should replace the status quo, even though everybody agrees that the current approach is wrong?",1

Desexualize the female body?,"Hello everyone. I don't really have an exact question, I'm just really confused as to what this phrase actually means?

I was talking about how society should desexualize the female body, but I was told that females shouldn't desexualize their bodies, instead others should stop unwanted sexualization of our bodies.

I mean, I do get what she meant, but I just thought that they both meant the same thing?? I thought the phrase ""Desexualize the female body"" was to stop society from sexualizing us unless we ourselves wanted to?? So I'm just quite confused, maybe I'm using the phrase wrong?",1

Do you believe there has been problem in a way that feminism promoting itself?","I am a man who has been keen into feminism since I was middle-schooler, and I have been doing some learning about the movement for quite some time.
I don't know a lot, but I reckon I know at least marginally more than average men.

At first, I was hostile about the movement, as ""feminists"" represented on media appeared to be aggressive and all they talked about was how men are bad and evil.
In videos, feminists were yelling ""kill all men"" and how they should revenge to men for suppressing them for centuries.
Above all, I even heard crazy story of a feminist who refused to give birth to her baby for that it was male.

I did not want to feel like I am a villan. 
I was certain I did nothing wrong to any women, and I liked to think I am a nice person. So I decided I do not agree with the movement and would not associate myself with anyone who has anything to do with that nonsense.

But the deal is that, 14 years old me was full of curiosity and he could not help but to find out more about it to ""hate it more"". 
However, after some sequence of events, I turned out to be liking the movement.
I read books, watched ted talks out of curiosity, and it lead me to be convinced by the narrative, so here I am.

Now I am even making small donations monthly to feminism org, but I still feel very uncomfortable talking on this matter with anyone because:

1. With women, I feel uncomfortable because it feels like I am mensplaning to them.

2. With men, I feel uncomfortable because I know people would not agree with me, and I will be judged by it.

Latter case have been much severe problem.
All of my friends who I care endearingly are very against feminism, and they hate it when I try to talk into it, as they never understand why I am agreeing with such bollocks.

I even once got into argument for the first time in 7 years with my best friend, talking about feminism and he could not fathom how I was defending such a ""horrifying antisocial movement consist of women with daddy issue that's ultimate goal is utter elimination of male species on face of the earth"".

He is a gentle man with fiance and I do not believe he have such perception because he is evil.
I know that because I once had such belief, and many men seemingly share the exact
Identical stereotype of feminism all over the world.

I, for one, honestly cannot find any reason other than a promotional failure.

Nude/erotic photography and feminism,"I would love to hear the opinions of other feminists on my struggle.
I am a photographer and I do shoot various topics. My most passionate topic is nude photography. Either in erotic context or just as showing the human form/‚Äûnudity as a tool for message‚Äú. 
I am a heterosexual, 24 year young man and my preferred subjects are women. I am talking about taking pictures myself aswell as consuming art of others (photography, paintings, videography).
I have mostly shot my former and current girlfriend, from normal portraits, Fashion, artistic nude to sexually themed and some female friends. They always loved to be part of my art and are passionate feminists themselves. I see myself as a passionate feminist aswell and I sometimes struggle with the thought of ‚Äûam I part of a problem‚Äú.
I read feminist literature, research problems, read a lot about feminist media studies (since I study media) and so I am aware of a lot of representation, sexualization and male gaze problems. 
I think I sometimes have somewhat of a ‚Äûmale gaze‚Äú, because I am identifying as a male and been sadly influenced by male gaze media all my life. I am always consuming and researching a lot of female and feminist art to have that as a positive influence next to all the mainstream problematic media and to prevent applying these male gaze patterns to my art.
So my problem is always questioning my art and art consumption. I would never want to be part of the problem of ‚Äûwrong‚Äú depiction of women, sexualization and so on. How can I appreciate and adore the female form of my girlfriends and other women, without supporting in a way the oversaturated market for nude, objectified women?
Even though I would never sexualize women for the sake of sex sells, or intendedly convey any sexist message. I look up to all the women I have in my life and all the women I want to capture in my art. 
Am I naive? Do I want to combine my feminist values with something that is just not compatible? 
When women tell me they feel empowered seeing my pictures of themselves, I am always happy but at the same time think ‚Äûbut what if it is just because they know me and how I think and these pictures still are problematic in the current debates and changes that have to happen in society?‚Äú.
Enough rambling. If I have phrased anything in a problematic way I am happy to be corrected.
I hope you have some insights and opinions for me from which I can learn and grow. 
Thank you!

A little extra edit:
I am only saying ‚Äûwomen‚Äú here without defining or including non binary and so on. This ist just because I am mostly surrounded with females identifying as cis women, while having many gay, bi and queer friends. I am definitely open and very interested to photograph non binary people, transgender people and males aswell. It is just from being grown up in a society with binary views and feeling heterosexual, that I talk about my preferred subjects as ‚Äûwomen‚Äú. But I am growing, I am learning and views, habits and preferences can change. :) Hope I don‚Äôt offend anyone, if so I am open for conversation and criticism.",1
Why are feminist from anglo countries are not nationalist or not as inclined to patriotism as from other non white or mixed countries?,"To explain it better: I'm Puerto Rican and the nationalist movement here differs very much from those in USA and Europe. Even though the movement is practically dead, it was a decent large group back in the 1930's-1950. My grandma was one of them, she was also a feminist as well and went to prison a few years for it. The most prominent feminist from PR came from the nationalist movement, including lolita lebron who literally shot up the american congress. While feminist I guess from spain or germany were running away from nationalist, the nationalist movement here was where most feminist resided and it was actually the socialist who had an alliance with the republicans(not US ones) to go after feminist.

But I always found it strange that here in PR feminists do tend to have more of a nationalist mindset than those in the US or europe where nationalism is pretty much shunned and almost illegal.",1

Let's take an exemple. Women are underrepresented in STEM so policies are set up. Okay. Men are underrepresented in higher education (40% against 60% of women). Here it is usualy seen as their issue for not being good students or being personal choice. But nothing is done, no policies etc. And here they are not seen as stronger or so as we clearly see they lag behind.

The same is for the rough sleeper who are overrepresented by men but the policies focus on the women. (even the policies for gender equality)

What about the UN which made a gendered policy leting men starving.

Identicaly for the issues coverage. why does the kidnaping of young girl is way more covered on MSM, social media (even relayed by political figures, stars etc) than the burning of hundreds of young boys? (here nothing from their part)

Last Name Change,"My girlfriend and I (male) were having a discussion about last names and what we could do if we were to get married. I have never considered changing my name or expected my future wife to do so. To me, that also includes not wanting to take on a hyphenated name either.

I‚Äôm perfectly fine with each of us keeping our last names and choosing a hyphenated name for the children but she wants us all to have the same last name and strongly thinks the solution is for both of us to change our last names to a hyphenated name. My aversion to the hyphenated name is firstly that I don‚Äôt want a longer name. Additionally, her last name translates to something that I don‚Äôt really want to have in my legal name. I like what my name translates to and I like affirming it each time I say my name.

In a perfect world, I‚Äôd like for us to have the same last name but I would never insist on her changing her name, either to mine or to a hyphenated one. Am I wrong in saying: let‚Äôs just keep our own last names and hyphenate them for the children? It seemed to spiral into a big fight when I wasn‚Äôt more submissive to hyphenating my name.

And the username of the person clearly said she was an anti feminist. But then again, Rape is not about feminism, is it? Shouldn't it be about rape itself? So I was curious as to why she, even if she was an anti feminist, would be against such a movement. As these movements give people voices. To hear their voice. To tell them they are not alone. That you got to survive. Its not political. Its  not about feminism. Or anti feminism. Its about sexually exploiting and assaulting someone. And if they want to talk about it however and wherever they want, they can. It confused me how a person can think its stupid.

Would socio-economic pressure on those refusing to take vaccines be a violation of bodily autonomy?,"Hey everyone, 

so I am aware that this question has been asked before but I wanted to to ask it again given that, since the pandemic , many views may have changed, especially if, like me, you are living in a country where up to 30% of people are expected to refuse it. I was also curious about people‚Äôs views on alternative means of pressuring people to take it, such as not allowing unvaccinated children in schools and allowing companies to refuse employment to those that are unvaccinated. I guess this question is mostly for those that think mandatory vaccinations are a violation because while such measures exert pressure, they only do so in order to protect the bodily autonomy of those that don‚Äôt wish to be exposed to those that present a significant health threat. Anyway, I look forward to hearing what you all thing :)",1
When do women have actual agency in the patriarchy?,I have to ask this because In a previous post it was said that everything is because of patriarchy whenever a woman chooses to do something in line with her gendered expectation then when does she actually make a decision based on her own personal agency. American sample of this would be every single time someone talks about women choosing to be a home caretaker as opposed to remaining in the workforce of patriarchy that she does this whether it be a conscious decision or not. My problem is this ignores the practicality and her being able to do it as well as her possibly wanting to do it simply because raising children might be something she wants to do and her spouse being able to financially support that decision is another reason why she makes that decision. Every example of this would be two of my friends or doctors and they are married and one of them decided to stop working because they would be spending almost the same amount of money on childcare. my male friend gave his wife the decision of whether she would stay with the family or he would and she chose that she would stay and take care of her two daughters more overtime to make up the difference. him sacrificing the time that he would have raised his daughter is another conversation but according to most feminist associated feminists on this group she made that decision because of patriarchy and it had almost little or nothing to do with her consciously deciding that she would rather spend more time raising her daughter than having her husband do it. My question is simple or fitness patriarchal structured society when exactly she making her own decision.,1
What are your thoughts on matriachal societies in works of fiction? (usually a fantasy or sci-fi book). Are there responsible or irresponsible ways of writing them?,"I'm not against writing matriarchies in fiction, but I think said work of fiction should clearly state that matriarchy or gender inequality is bad and that we shouldn't strive towards that, or else many people might interpret these works of fiction as being an endorsement of matriarchy. 

I remember one book I read in 7th grade the (can't remember the name but I'm pretty sure it was written in the 1970s) that was a futuristic sci-fi fantasy type book about a matriarchal society where young boys and girls are raised collectively by adult women and surnames don't exist, only unique one-word names (example: Socrates) The society in the book is peaceful and relatively equal on an interpersonal level, but is lead and controlled solely or mostly by women. (If you know the name of the book, tell me) The book came off as being very pro-matriarchy to me. The book seemed to endorse, at least implicitly, the idea that the world be more peaceful and better in every way if society was lead solely or mostly by women. But we already have real world examples of women in politics who are warhawks, such as Neera Tanden, Hillary Clinton, Nikki Haley, Gina Haspel, (pretty much the whole GOP) and the former female president of Myanmar who waged a genocide to the country's Rohinga Muslims. Some female politicians are corrupt and have disregard for the poor and disenfranchised, such as Diane Feinstein and Nancy Pelosi, and pretty much every elected Republican woman. I get really annoyed when some people (I'm not accusing most feminists of believing this, it's more the New Agey goddess movement types) sincerely believe all the worlds problems would women just controlled all the major centers of power and authority. It seems so naive and childish to think that. I think a fictional matriarchy should be written in such a way that it serves as a criticism of gender inequality as a way to structure society. For example, you can write a book about a fictional black supremacist society, but said fictional society should serve as a criticism of racial supremacy as a concept by trying to flip our current real-world white supremacist society on it's head. The same can be done with gender.",1
Wouldn't absolute equality take away from female privilege and made privilege,"That's suppose to say male privilege .If a quality is supposed to mean the same and equal treatment financially legally and socially. Then that means either we treat women like men or we treat men like women and give them the same exact responsibilities, obligations, pay regardless of qualifications or child rearing prospects. We view them the same way and treat them the same way. This would naturally mean treating women like men with both the consequences of being a man and the rewards of being a man. Naturally I'm going to exclude criminals and criminal behavior unless we're talking about sentencing or disciplining them since their is a gender bias in sentencing.",1
Where should the line be drawn for sex work in monogamous relationships?,"First of all I want to say that I am aromantic, therefore I don‚Äôt understand the emotional parts of a relationship so I try to approach logically and rationalize people‚Äôs feelings.

So I am pretty sure most people here support sex work, and think that the standard should be that a partner doesn‚Äôt mind that their partner is a sex worker. I also think this way. My question is that if that is okay is having sexual intercourse while in a relationship also okay? Now I tried to come up with reasons why one is right while the other isn‚Äôt but not much has worked for me.

For instance, one reason could be that intercourse is personal and attraction or even a relationship could be born from that while sex work is usually a one time thing. But then again attraction can be born from a lot of things including simply having male friends and it would be ridiculous to be limiting to that extent

Toxic Masculinity v/s personal preferences.,"How can we differentiate between Toxic Masculinity v/s personal preferences? Say, I would not like it if I found out that my gf had an onlyfans or had a large number of sexual partners in the past.

Again, I know it is none of my business what she does with her body and with whom, but I think I can make the choice to not continue a relationship with her - like having an onlyfans  / having sex with a lot of people was her choice, and me breaking up with her is my choice? And anyway, if I am such a ""terrible"" person just because I broke up with her because of that, she should not want to be with me right? So everyone wins - since now she could probably find a guy who would not judge her for that? ",1

Do teenage boys have to learn with age to respect women? Are many of them sexist?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/k73cnr/has_anyone_else_noticed_this_sub_getting_really/

I my experience from high school and also from reading online...teenage boys are the most sexist demographic. I.e being openly sexist and hating girls. I remember fishy jokes and sexist jokes. And also many gamers for example are young men and teens and apparently they are incredibly sexist and make rape threats towards girl gamers. It also seems it's mostly young men and teen boys who incels or are indoctrinated to hate women the most.

Also when someone makes a sexist joke or a ""fishy"" vagina or ""axe wound"" joke for example...many say they are probably just ""pathetic immature teenage boys"" as if that is expected of them so any adult who behaves that way is acting immature like them. Whenever people say that i wonder why immaturity makes men sexist?

On the other hand most teen girls are really into boys. They adore boys in boybands, write in diaries about boys, want boyfriends, and some even have internalised misogyny and be anti feminist themselves by saying ""I'm not like other girls!"" Want to be friends with boys. Etc.

Do you think most or many teenage boys are sexist and with age learn to respect or tolerate women? It seems like the starting point and default for many men is being sexist maybe due to hormones and then with age it gradually gets less extreme. 

I think from what I've seen and learned...the biggest differences in how women and men view each other are shown in how teenage girls are with the opposite sex and how teenage boys are with the opposite sex. Sadly.",1

Why are gamers racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic + not really cool to people who are nuerodivergent but I dont know the name for that yet ect?,"Now I know this is going to come across real low effort and probably trip up the antagonism alarm but I do want to ask the question.

I go to r/gamingcirclejerk a fair bit and the ones where ha ha ""Gamers do weird things for fake internet points"" dont really interest me or the ones where we make fun of some niche concept liek showing off a thing.  

But the ones that are interesting are the ones where gamers freak out over gay people, trans people, black people ect.  The ones where you can see the elitism (see Jim Fucking Sterling Son's New Video on it, its good), that's usually kinda gendered and toxically masculine.  Dont get them started on Brie Larson.

But I have to ask why?  Why are ""Gamers"" like this?  Why these guys?  You can extend the same question to anime fans but still why?  Like I know why gaming is heavily masculine, 90s and 80s commercials (which I do have to ask, why doesnt the ""Now you're playing with power!  Now you're playing with Super Power! Appeal to women?  Is that just representation?  Like if a girl was in that commercial would it have caught on?), marketed to just boys and kept on as they grew older.  But why did that create such a toxic space?

What are your opinions on capitalism?,"Hello,

I am not a right winger but I grew up in a conservative family and as such got a rather large dosing of conservative media. As a part of all that, you get to hear all about the evils of socialism and sjws and feminism and whatever. One thing right wing media does a lot is constantly paint feminists and social rights activists with a relatively broad brush and say that they all fit into this category. That's rather ridiculous as I have talked to a lot of feminists and the diversity of opinion between them is wide ranging. Regardless, one thing you consistently hear is that they are socialist or whatever, and a lot of feminists that I have met and talked to aren't the biggest fans of capitalism to say the least. I often hear the capitalism reinforces the patriarchy or in and of itself is gendered. To be honest, I have never fully understand what people mean by this. So, I came to ask. First and foremost, what does it mean when people say that capitalism is inherently gendered and patriarchal. What mechanisms does it use. The gender pay gap? Is that an inherently capitalist idea? Or are there other ways I'm not familiar with. Second, do you agree with these ideas. Is capitalism something you see as something we need to fight against or is it something that can be modified to be workable? Why/why not? Preemptive thanks for the replies!",1
What do feminists think of the South African farm murders?,"I know that this doesn't directly correlate to feminist ideals and beliefs and is moreso a race issue rather than a feminist issue (if there's a subreddit more appropriate, please let me know and I'll delete this post), but I would like to see what feminists think of it nonetheless. TW// mentions of rape and torture

Little bit of history, I was born in South Africa and raised there until I was 7, currently residing in the UK though, that being said, majority of my family still lives in South Africa. I'm not even sure whether people are aware of it, but there has been a scary amount of South Africa farm murders, particularly targeting white farmers, they weren't just murders however, majority were brutally tortured and some raped, this kind of farm murder has been the majority of cases ever since the land reform act by the South African government, majority of South Africans believe this to be because the government themselves have not only called for it (https://youtu.be/-VXJrxM2HPc Malema, a member of South African parliament) but also due to the fact that majority of the farms had nothing actually stolen as well as inhuman acts of cruelty.

That being said, I have seen people deny that it's actually happening, despite the fact that the exact same thing happened in Zimbabwe (with Mugabe saying to white farmers to fight his government and risking a jail sentence or flee from Zimbabwe), farm murders rose continually from 2011 to 2018 where the numbers dropped and have started rising again.

What I want to know is whether you believe that they are being killed because they're white or if you don't think so, why not?

This is not meant to be antagonising but genuinely curious as to the thinking that it's not due racism that these attacks are being carried out.",1
Why is being eco-friendly more popular with women?,"&gt;Scholars have proposed several explanations for this gender gap, including differences in gender socialization and resulting value systems (e.g., altruism, compassion), perceptions of general risk and vulnerability, and feminist beliefs including commitment to egalitarian values of fairness and social justice. [Some researchers](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08941920.2011.651191) also note that some of the strongest gender differences are found in concern about specific environmental problems, particularly local problems that pose health risks.

These are the potential reasons cited by the authors of the study, but do you think there is more to it than just these? I remember reading somewhere that a study showed that men and women both viewed eco-friendly products as being more feminine and that most eco-friendly products are indeed marketed towards women. Do you think there is a resulting stigma around men who try to be environmentally conscious? And on that note, do you think women are held to a higher standard when it comes to being eco-friendly?

How do you acknowledge and or reconcile differences in men and women‚Äôs sex drives?,"Context: yes men and women both get horny but to the extent of which and how much of a physical impact said hornieness affects gender is the focus of the question. In the context of relationships, hookup culture, ect. In life as a man it seems the physical impact of said sexuality is greater for men than it is women. Do you think horniness has a bigger impact on men than women simply because men dont require the emotional connection that women often do and as science notes men are more visually triggered in avg than women. 


Note this is only focused on internal emotions and not trying to justify anyones inability to control themselves. This is simply focusing on the difference of healthy sexual urges that men have vs women.

Edit: i noticed this got flagged as a reoccurring question. I checked previous threads on sex drives prior to this and noticed a lot of talk about it being a ‚Äúmyth‚Äù of the differences in male and female sex drive . I think science says otherwise that testosterone breeds in men 365 days a year the equivalent of what women feel at the peak of their cycle only once a month. So i think its fair to say its not a myth that men experience greater sex drives

Edit: The argument is not that women don‚Äôt have sexual appetites. Its that men are willing to and are driven to go further than women to achieve sex. A man is much more willing to jump through hoops to get to consensual first, second or third base opportunities where on the flip. Do women have to jump through hoops for sex? Note yes women perform risk assessment for any relationship encounter but jumping through hoops isnt the same as a risk assessment.

The story of Sarah Fuller a women's soccer player dominated sports news last week 
but has received some backlash because a lot of people feel it was blown out of proportion to the point of patronizing her because she is a woman. There were other female place kickers before her who played in college but they are hailing her as the first woman to play in a power 5 game and comparing her to Jackie Robinson. She was chosen as a last resort because there were no other place kickers available due to covid, and there was no men's soccer team. 

When she did perform on the field she performed up to expectations but expectations for her were not set very high compared to most other kickers in the college game. In short she didn't blow it but didn't do anything extraordinary for a kicker (man or woman) 

At halftime she gave the team a speech calling the other players out even though she had only been a football player for less than a week before she joined the team (which actually got a lot of criticism as well) I think a lot of the criticism had to do with her being a woman but I'm not sure if it was appropriate to make such a big deal out of a pedestrian performance because of her gender.

Any UK (transgender) medical ethics people here?,"As you might know, there has been this recent ruling (PDF warning) [*Bell v Tavistock*](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bell-v-Tavistock-Judgment.pdf) the high court concluded that under 16s are unable to give consent to recieve puberty blockers. 

This is a very strange ruling considering the context and history of similar cases relating to consent of minors and in particular with regards to sexual health. They've basically concluded that under 16s are not intellectually capable of understanding the details and consequences of medical transition. That's an *absurd* and *obscene* conclusion to make - and it doesn't seem to line up with any of the relevant law on the matter, and also doesn't seem to have much to do with the cases presented.

I've just also noted that one of the third party interventions is from a company called (CW transphobia) &gt;!Transgender Trend Ltd.!&lt; That is, a company whose very name probably qualifies as a hate crime.

We're kind of under time pressure here, consideing that this ruling will affect some who are *currently* using puberty blockers, and if they're forced to go off them, the consequences could be dire.",1
Thoughts on the lock and key analogy for men and women‚Äôs double standard with dating number of partners?,"First off slut shamming is terrible and this is not to condone it, troll it, justify it ect. Thats not the point of this post its to posit a serious question if how men and women have different standards for sexual partners. That said.

But the analogy goes men are like keys women are like locks. A lock that can be opened by many keys is seen as not as valuable, a key that can open any lock is seen as valuable, and a lock that many keys want to open but cant is seen as valuable and a lock that no-one wants to open is seen as not valuable.

While simplistic, i think its meant to point out that in western dating sex is relatively easier for women than it is for men broadly speaking( the whole average guy and average women walk into a bar who has a better chance of getting lucky that night) to obtain sex on avg. Men who have several previous sexual partners are seen as valuable by other guys because he has achieved something that is difficult and takes effort for most guys. Women value these guys because of said efforts ( be in gym time, learning to be charismatic, and learning skills that women generally find attractive, and other things because women‚Äôs sexual attraction is so much more complex than mens)

If a woman wanted to increase the  number of people she slept with she might have to lower some standards but she wouldn‚Äôt have to learn any skills to get a guy to sleep with her it and its safe to assume she could do that by simply matching on tinder and finding someone same night. A man looking to do the same would have to actually put in serious effort for the same result. So for that reason society might value chastity or even just lower previous sexual partner counts in a women differently because in a way its an exercise of self control and good selection/ having higher standards? Just a thought.

Edit: also I‚Äôm not saying or implying sex with women as any type of prize or saying men should be guaranteed sex. Just pointing out a difference in the effort it takes to achieve the same mutual goal

Edit: also not implying women are property. Sex is a relation but i am merely pointing out are there are different amounts of effort to put in to achieve the same mutual beneficial sexual relation

Edit: many if you have made a great point. The value part of the analogy is distracting and implies sexism. To better highlight the effort difference i think its better to use the job analogy of men have to apply for even a few women to  prove they are not a threat and may be worth sleeping with where as women have to filter through applicants. While both have their challenges one can lower their standards to filter out a suitable partner for a mutual relationship while the other has to inevitably  work  harder in their resume and or apply more. Different roles different skill sets to achieve mutually beneficial sex",1

And now with it at least doubling over the Covid period according to the UN Deputy Executive Director, outside the first world we have places in Eastern Europe and South America where women are doing 450% and 500% more unpaid labor than men and third world areas where women are doing 600-700% more.

Who is telling the truth in this situation?,"Ok

I am a man who is somewhat politically active (I focus on issues regarding child custody, special needs and a few other things, and before you ask, I don't follow a party and don't plan to follow a party)

In a debate on the issue of child custody, a woman who was debating me stated that anyone who supported the idea of rebuttable shared custody was not a true feminist and a true feminist would understand that children are always better off with the mother, except for cases of abuse (which she stated that those should be proven in criminal court, if applicable).

A while later, I had a similar discussion with a different woman (also a feminist, same topic) who stated that the feminist position is or should be to support shared custody when there's no abuse. The topic then turned to gender roles and how they should or shouldn't apply.

What I want to know is who of these people is right and why? If the feminist position is to oppose shared custody or to support it, fine. But it cannot be both at the same time.

For clarity, I understand that they have a personal opinion on the topic, I'm more worried about the position of feminism as a whole on the topic.

Recommended Radical Readings,"Hello. My sister has been going into  process of radicalization in regard to feminism and I want to help her by guiding her. I am excited she has begun this exploration of politics and values, and am eager to see where she gets; however, I have notied most of the content she gets comes from social media and a couple of gender studies bachelors, which is good, but I think that would go well with some theory from some cool academics. I kinda wanna surprise her for christmas with some books like ""hey, this is important, I love you're getting into it, have some resources as a symbol of my support""

We're Mexicans and she, like many other women, have been drawn to feminism because of the recent movements. She's 15, so the works cannot be too specific on a single thing (like law or philosophy), but she's really smart so complex is fine, just not too technical. I already found ""Are Women Human?"" by Catharine MacKinnon and I think that's something that will interest her deeply and that she can understand; going along those lines would be great. She is obviously more interested in radical feminism becaus that's the most popular branch in Mexico, and if you happen to know about any LatAm writers, that would be great. If you have any questions I'm happy to anwer them, and thank you for your help :)

Why is there an asymmetry in hateful language in traditional vs online media?,"Research suggests that any use of categorical, discrete categories is associated with stigma towards less favoured categories.

Can I be a traditionally masculine guy without contributing to societal misogyny?,"I would post this on r/MensLib but they don't do personal stuff.

So here's the rub. I am a 19M and come from a relatively conservative family (though I am a liberal). I worry that I am not man enough a lot. I am a vegan for ethical reasons, I have listened to music from people like Swift, I have secretly enjoyed rom coms, I am trying to get new clothes because I am insecure about appearance, etc. Traditionally this stuff is considered more feminine than masculine. I want to be more traditionally masculine in the sense that I want to think of myself as a man and want to feel that I deserve to be called a man. I have 0 problem if other men want to do this stuff, you're a man if you feel you are after all, but I feel like I have to earn it in order to say it and to honestly feel it. However, I also recognize the tremendous damage traditional gender roles has done to people and how it has contribute to widespread societal misogyny. Like the idea that men are always out for sex and should dominate leads to sexual harassment and at its worse sexual violence  which is obviously horrendous.

I want to be more traditionally masculine in the positive sense, i.e. more physically strong, confident, protective, capable of providing, a leader, etc not in the sense of like treating women like objects or being a womanizer. More Steve Rogers than james bond if that makes sense.

However, I wonder if I can still be masculine in the traditional sense without contributing to misogyny. I don't want to be misogynistic and I worry that worrying I am too feminine is inherently bigoted and sexist. There's nothing wrong with being feminine I just don't want to be. Is such thinking sexist? Am I being misogynistic? Can I be more ""masculine"" without contributing to sexism? I'm trying to figure out what it means to be a man and who I should be.

Is having more women and fewer men better for both men and women?,"Of course, selecting sex in a way that results in a ratio other than parity is perhaps not ethical or even feasible, but let's abstract away from this issue in order to facilitate the thought experiment: would having more women and fewer men lead to

a) Less crime, particularly violent crime: Men are largely responsible for most violent crime.

b) A less patriarchal society: this is a little vague, as ""the patriarchy"" may not be invariant under such a change and may take a form that we perhaps cannot anticipate. So let's just say a society where men do not control the vast majority of resources.

c) Better women's safety: Related to point a)

d) Less frustrated, lonely men: It seems to me that cis-hetero men (i.e. large majority of men) tend to become more resentful and angry without female companionship than other groups of people do when they are lonely. There's a plethora of reasons why this may be case but I won't get into it. 

Hypothetical ""what-ifs"" are necessarily somewhat difficult to answer, but I there's a specific reason I wanted to engage in this thought experiment which is to answer these (perhaps more fundamental) questions

e) Are women inherently less violent than men (on average) or do men simply possess a monopoly on violence due to being physically stronger than women.?

f) Does a patriarchal society need a critical mass of men? Or can a women majority society still lead to a deification of the rare man?",1

There was someone who explained to me that misandry in the context of mysogyny, is not real and is often just an anti-feminist dogwhistle, and that things I described as misandry (like masculine men discriminating more feminine or non-conforming males, or trans/nb-men feeling invalidated by men-bashers) are closer to general homotransphobia or other forms of discrimination, and not specifically misandry.

That made sense to me, but later I saw some other people say that misandry does exist, for example how when parents divorce, the child automatically goes to the mother even if they want otherwise, and that how some people generalising men by saying they're all inherently evil etc. can hurt victims of abuse because it plays on their emotions and makes them feel more paranoid.

Why do sexual fantasies seem to deeply follow gender norms?,"I don't know whether this is the place to ask the question but here goes, I've been reading up on sexual fantasies held by men and women. It seems to me that it's not uncommon for women to desire rough sex/have rape fantasies even though they'd never want to be raped. Similarly, many men have fantasies about dominating another woman.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, why do these fantasies follow the 'gender script' of the man being dominant and woman being submissive? It seems very uncommon to find men fantasizing about being dominated along with finding women who fantasize about dominating/raping.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think that beliefs about gender get internalized and influence what someones sexual fantasies may be or do you think it's just a biological difference driven by different sex hormones?",1

"""Women's logic"" as an evolutionary survival strategy","Please take this as a serious scientific inquiry.

1) Up to a certain time, survival of the children depended heavily on the father's presence in the family.  Therefore women‚Äôs ability to ‚Äúkeep the man around‚Äù after conception was an essential survival strategy.

2) In numerous books we hear authors idealizing a woman as a mystery.  Perhaps this is an indication that inability to understand the opposite sex is an attractant for males.

3) If this is true, could there be an evolutionary pressure to produce behavior that is difficult to understand and therefore helps maintain the family?  Giving birth to what is called ""Women's logic"".

4) From game theory we know that the best strategy taken by an opponent should appear random to the other player.  Can this fact apply?

Feminists seem very reluctant, harmful even, to even recognizing that heterosexual male victims of domestic violence even exist. It almost seems to be a source of humor on many feminist social media accounts. Feminists organizations routinely fight against shelters for men, and campaign for gendered law that exclude men and essentially amount to quasi-legalization of domestic violence against men.

I know that inequality in the past was justified by patriarchy because men had to fight in wars, and  I know that being a stay-at-home mom is a difficult job too \[But probably you would prefer that against getting your limbs blown off or being tortured in a Japanese prisoner camp\], but like, what if some countries \[like China\] continue holding these toxic masculine traits , which might harm men themselves, but overall it leads to good for the country \[I mean China as a culture, both men and women have drastically reinvented themselves\]?

Understanding white feminist as a black man,"Hello its my first time posting but i come with nothing but good intentions and a desire to see and understand others viewpoint. As a black man in America its often strange to see white women speak of oppression from men. It would seem to me that they are complaining about oppression from their own families and friends seeing as how at least on America 9/10 times the only men who have any sort of ‚Äúpower‚Äù over them are other white men. Non white men don‚Äôt hold that much power in America as a whole as we often don‚Äôt own resources/ means of production ect, And most of the black women that I have grown up with have had the majority of their oppression come from other whites male and female as opposed to black men. Not saying that black men cant and aren‚Äôt sexist, but from a socioeconomic and power dynamic perspective isnt the majority of oppression coming from white men and women. (Note im well aware of intersectionality but i think its important to view oppression through an economic lens as it paint a less biased picture. From there we see greater disparities between races than we do gender with white men and women always being at the top.) 

TLDR: how should black and minority men view feminism when the vast majority of this gendered oppression is linked directly back to white men and women(e.i. The number of white women who voted for trump) 

Thank you and nothing but love to ya

Edit:

The reason why i bring up economics is because you can easily measure it in terms of who stands where most other metrics of oppression are based on feelings and there isnt a concrete way to say where anyone stands.

Also black men and women power dynamics isnt the same as in white house holds. Yes there are exceptions but most black women in my life have always been strong well educated leaders who for the most part out perform black men from many socioeconomic indicators. It just seems like white women loom at how their moms and aunts were treated by sexist men and assume thats how everyones household is when it couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.",1

Cancelling men and toxic masculinity,"So I understand that male actors or males in the hollywood business do not really contribute something to society, so it is easy to cancel them and not watch their stuff and kick them out of their jobs  - but what if we talk about people like Newton, Einstein, Nikola Tesla, Christian Barnard, Louis Pasteur. So if you found out that they were rapists or sexual assaulters, does that mean that their contributions to science does not mean anything anymore?  For instance, Christian Barnard was a South African, so it is very likely that he was actively involved in apartheid, but without him, we would not have the heart transplant.   That we should deny their genius and then maybe feminists should also stop using any appliances/products that seem to have resulted out of their toxic masculine minds.

I mean, I saw some posts here about Sean Connery. He was born in 1930. His movies are not sexist, they are an accurate representations of the times that he lived in.

Can the Male Gaze exist in Feminism?,"Hi, new to the sub, and Feminism as a whole. I've been skimming through the sub, primarily on topics of the Male Gaze and Objectification, as they are deeply intertwined in the types of media that I generally consume. I'm kind of digging myself out of that unfortunate bubble where the dominant thought about Feminism when it comes to the Male Gaze is, ""Feminists just want everyone covered up, and no attractive women at all, in anything, ever and if you disagree you're a sexist, bigot etc. etc."" I don't think I ever got to the point where I believed that in its entirety, but I can't help but think sometimes that there's a kernel of truth to it, sometimes. 
Say we do finally reach an equal/nearly equal world as Feminism aims for, does that mean that the Male Gaze has been completely dismantled because it can lead to objectification, and eventually dehumanization of marginalized groups, mostly women, or can it exist if it were used more limitedly, and wasn't the predominant mode of media? 

TL;DR Does the Male Gaze have to be destroyed in its entirety in order for us to reach an equal society, or just significantly limited until other points of view are normalized?

Thank you for any responses.",1
How is rape only about power?,"I'm just remembering a situation that happened back in college, where one of my friends was accused of rape (never proven, no police report either so idk) at a party we were all at and we don't know if he did it, but if he did, I just realized something.

"Why is there still so much stigma towards women that want to be welders, firefighters, or roofers?",,1
Why is the negative reinforcement that women receive about sex (slut-shaming) seen as a problem but not the negative reinforcement that men receive about sex?,"The general argument that I hear from feminists, about why it seems like men are far more interested in sex than women in heterosexual relationships, is that it's because society condemns the female expression of sexuality by slut-shaming those who engage in it. Now although I disagree with this premise, for the sake of this post, I'm going to assume it's a fact and that women face a lot of judgement in society for the free expression of their sexuality that serves as negative reinforcement.

What I actually wanted to talk about is the other side of the coin that I don't see often feminists address, which is that when men pursue a purely sexual/aromantic relationship, they are still condemned for not seeking it in the manner that women deem appropriate. My argument is that any kind of sexual desire outside of certain types of sexual-romantic relationships is stigmatized, and judging from the way media tends to portray men who seek a purely sexual relationship, one of those stigmas seems to be enforced much more on men rather than women.

For example, here's a list of characters that are written in a way that makes them seem repugnant for desiring sex without it being nested within a romantic relationship.

(Note: Some of these aren't portrayed as assholes, but they are still looked down on by other characters.)

* Hugo in Killing Eve
* Hank Moody in Californication
* Alan Shore in Boston Legal
* Dan Fielding in Night Court
* Ben and Fitz in Friends With Benefits (mostly not viewed negatively by other characters, although Ben is viewed as immature and shallow)
* Lucifer in Lucifer
* Hawkeye Pierce in M\*A\*S\*H
* Eliot in The Magicians
* Sebastian in Cruel Intentions
* Euan in Off Centre
* Kurt in Horrible Bosses
* Harrison in Scandal
* Dennis in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Dean in Supernatural
* James Bond
* Neal Caffrey in White Collar

I personally find the double standards really appalling where a woman's sexual hang-ups are seen as a responsibility of society whereas for men it's not even considered an issue that needs to be solved.

The general perception about men who engage in numerous casual sexual affairs with women is that he's a misogynist who objectifies them, even though that‚Äôs between him and the women he‚Äôs had sexual relations with. The argument is that because he had sex with these women, he treated them like objects, less than men.

But this analysis is predicated on two assumptions:

1. A romantic relationship is morally superior to one that's purely sexual.
2. You can't find somebody sexually attractive and still be extremely respectful of their autonomy as capable smart human being

Seeing your sexual partners as playthings for your own amusement is completely fine as long as you‚Äôre sexual partners with those people consensually. That‚Äôs between you and them. Sexual attraction without romantic attraction or even friendship is fine and valid, and some people can‚Äôt even feel romantic attraction, while still being able to feel sexual attraction.

I feel like I'm saying something very obvious when I assert that it's not abuse to have consensual sex with people that you‚Äôre only interested in sexually, not romantically or platonically. If women really weren‚Äôt okay with what they were getting into with him, then they shouldn‚Äôt have consented, and that‚Äôs on the women, not the guy.

Women often speak about how a man isn't owed sex from women, but the inverse of this, where a woman expects romance from a man who has sex with her, isn't talked about as much. For some reason, it's believed that it's easier for men to be open about seeking and having casual sexual encounters that don't carry any expectations of romance or ongoing commitment without facing judgement, even though I sincerely believe they receive just as much negative reinforcement because romance is looked at as some kind of universal ultimate good thing whereas sex without romance is evil and wrong and harmful. It's like purity culture and sex shaming, which is harmful to everyone but especially toxic toward anyone who has sex outside of romantic relationships. At the end of the day, there is nothing wrong with having sex without romance. Ever. Romance isn't inherently good, sex isn't inherently bad, and romance doesn't ""purify"" sex or whatever (nor does it need to). Sexual attraction isn't wrong or objectifying or predatory or manipulative; your actions are what matter. Sure, it's not something that everyone wants, but neither is romance.

Anyway, in conclusion, I believe if feminists want to see the negative reinforcement towards sex-seeking women as a problem that needs to be solved, then so should the negative reinforcement that happens towards men who seek the same kind of sex.",1

What are your views on Leonardo Dicaprio dating girls half his age?,"My view on this is that as long as two people are legal adults and there is consent, there is nothing wrong with dating people who are younger/older to you. I often hear feminists say that he is a creep and should be condemned. However, not once do they say anything about the girls who are willing to date him. Do you believe that those girls have no agency and not a thought process of their own to make decisions for themselves? Why do you need to villianise him? Either condemn both genders or dont do it at all. Truth be told, most men who are as rich and successful as him would date models in their 20s. Similarly, most women would not decline if Leo fucking Dicaprio asked them out. Why such double standards? Funnily enough, Jada Smith did not receive flak (atleast not at the level men get) for dating August, who was 20yrs old. People are free to do what they want, as long as it is legal. Live and let live.

Edit: Okay. I see that I ruffled a few feathers here. But if you call leo a creep and don't call the women gold diggers, you are a hypocrite. Either don't shame any of them or shame both. You can't have your cake and eat it too.

Is the situation of women in middle east and their rights and matters related to them bad or good?,"ah sorry if i wasnt able to explain it in the title more accurately... I meant that, a frnd of mine recently told me how people in middle east live really happily and how the monarchy has done them (edit: i mean the monarch nations of the ME) really good. and even though, i dont have the knowledge about it to check his facts, I wondered if the situation of women was same as what he told me.  because from what i  know, saudi aribia just recently gave the women their driving rights and women were still fighting to at least be allowed to watch the fifa 21. i hvnt been updated on that so i would like to apologize in advance. so thats why i would like to ask about it.",1
"I want to be a feminist, but I am not sure. Should I be one?","Now, DON'T get me wrong. I appreciate women, I know they suffer, and I am here to help. and to be honest, i was a feminist myself. but the way it is being done right now is very biased towards one gender. let me give an example. on the instagram page ""@feminist,"" which amasses 6.4M followers, they have a bunch of memes that quite literally say ""rape is a man issue,"" while it is a HUMAN issue.

Another skepticality I have with feminism is the attack on the MRM (Men's Rights Movement). While I do think that MRM derived from feminism, my view on it isn't harsh. i don't think they bring down women (AND IF THEY DO THEY SHOULD BE CALLED OUT ON IT!), but rather bring awareness to the problems men face like the higher rate of suicide, or the unfair family courts.

Now, something I REALLY hate is the #KillAllMen movement or the #MenTears movement. a 2013 [HuffPost/YouGov poll](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/feminism-poll_n_3094917.html) found that only 23 percent of women and 16 percent of men consider themselves to be feminists. Of that 16 percent, surely even fewer would find jokes about misandry funny.

**Now for my question: If you tried to convince someone to become a feminist, what would you say?**

Sincerely,

Your hope-to-be male feminist.

Why do some people find it so hard to accept calling women ‚Äúfemale/s‚Äù is offensive?,"I was arguing with someone who just didn‚Äôt get it (see my comments and you should easily find it if you‚Äôre interested in what I said) 
I don‚Äôt understand why some people just refuse to accept it‚Äôs wrong. 
It‚Äôs wrong for many reasons but the main two are obvious: 
1.	‚Å†It‚Äôs actually ungrammatical . ‚ÄúFemale‚Äù is an adjective not a noun and describes the sex of a species, for humans, the correct term for adult female is ‚Äúwomen‚Äù.
2.	‚Å†Semantic change: When people use ‚ÄúFemale‚Äù in place of ‚Äúwomen‚Äù they typically do it with the sole purpose of degrading women. It‚Äôs used to dehumanise women. ‚ÄúFemale‚Äù could describe any animal that has eggs.

Why is it so hard for people to realise this? 

I also found an interesting article here: 

https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/time.com/4300170/female-word/%3famp=true

Which suggests the term has been offensive even as far back as 1850!

Edit: I know it can also be used as a noun however it‚Äôs more often than not an adjective, when it‚Äôs used to dehumanise women it is almost always being used in a way that is ungrammatical. 

I‚Äôm not objecting the word full stop there is nothing wrong with statements like ‚Äúthe female brain differs from the male brain‚Äù or ‚Äúon average females tend to have longer hair styles‚Äù 

What I‚Äôm objecting to is statements like ‚Äúall females are the same‚Äù and ‚Äúfemales be like [insert misogynistic comment here]‚Äù as a method of dehumanising women. In this context using ‚Äúfemales‚Äù is a stones throw away from ‚Äúfemoid‚Äù and ‚Äúfoid‚Äù which are undoubtedly sexist. 

I don‚Äôt object to those who use it accidentally without realising in some contexts the meaning of the word has different connotations, but I do object to those who once told the phrase is offensive refuse to learn and change their language.",1

What's an appropriate punishment for a woman who commits first degree murder?,"Say not in self defense, in cold blood for money. Say she kills a man.

[This article here](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/01/why-we-should-close-womens-prisons-and-treat-their-crimes-more-fairly) argues that women should **never** go to prison for any crime, including murder.

&gt;Women do of course commit homicide offences, but nearly always the victim is a relative and the crime was committed against the backdrop of an abusive relationship or **depressive mindset**. All homicides are heinous crimes but the types of homicides committed by women rarely involve random victims and hence do not engender community fear

"I hate incels and MRA‚Äôs but I don‚Äôt consider myself a feminist, am I part of the problem?","I suppose I could be best described as a classical liberal; I completely support the things that the first and second waves of feminism have fought for, but I don‚Äôt agree with most of what contemporary feminism in the west is fighting for. On the other hand, I _abhor_ incels, mainly because of how they view women and their propensity towards self pity and blaming others for their own faults.

I was raised (am being raised) in a pretty conservative household, being taught (mostly by example) to have stereotypically masculine characteristics such as to not show negative emotions in public, among others. However I don‚Äôt consider myself to be toxicity masculine; I don‚Äôt use anger as an outlet for my emotions to be sure.

With all that said, how can I better empathize with the feminist cause? I want to know what you fight for and the strategies you wish to implement to achieve such goals.

How can I get rid of my internalized misogyny?,"I grew up in a very misogynistic environment, with brothers and many male relatives.

What do people think about using TVTropes to gauge the prevalence of stereotypes in media?,"Media can create, affirm, and challenge popular stereotypes, and can serve as a sort of litmus test on societal perceptions at large.  However, measuring media seems like a near-impossible task to do well - one can only watch so much, and even that won't likely be a representative sample of all media.

[This blog](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/experiments/quantifying-gender-stereotypes-in-pop-culture/) (first post in r/menslib but I think the approach is useful more generally) tries to use TVTropes as way of outsourcing the work of ""watching and categorizing all the media"".  The idea is that TVTropes covers a huge selection of media (not just TV), and seems to have a somewhat rigorous method for identifying stereotypes.  Yes, the info is sourced from imperfect humans and all our biases, but for such a difficult and vague task can we expect much better?

The author compiles all the stereotypes that are associated with gender, and looks at which are the most prevalent.  Furthermore, the date of each occurrence is tracked, allowing for [time comparisons of prevalence](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Change-since-2000-1536x1536.png) pre/post turn-of-the-century that show which stereotypes are going away and which persist (or are growing).  A quick look suggests that damsel-in-distress is on the way out, but slut shaming has stuck around more (although I don't know if that's still true in 2015+).  I think this could be a useful, if imprecise, way of measuring progress in eroding harmful stereotypes.  It could also highlight whether there are some areas where outdated views persist.  However, I have some concerns on the reliability of this dataset.  I wouldn't take it as literal truth, but more as one decent indicator.

Do people think this is a useful endeavor?  Is the data from TVTropes reliable enough, representative enough?  Are there other large-scale methods that have attempted categorize stereotype prevalences (or similar) in media?",1
Do you think feminism can be toxic or used in a hurtful way?,"1.I am male and a teen please go a little easy on me if I don‚Äôt understand.

2. So my question is that if feminism is taken to far can it be hurtful/bad? I have always believed that anything taken to the extreme is very bad and I was wondering if it also applies to feminism. I get that every group or movement has a subset of people that take things to far or used to movement to be mean or toxic but when I talk to some of my feminist friends about feminism and what does it mean, they often change the subject to your an ass, and this is what‚Äôs wrong with men which I see as a bad thing, but maybe I don‚Äôt understand?

So what do you think? Am I just clueless?

Book Recommendations on Internalized Misogyny,"I [23F] grew up in a very conservative Christian culture, which has a tendency to be pretty misogynistic. While I am still Christan, I have come a really long way culturally to become the very progressive feminist I am now, but I often find myself getting really overwhelmed with internalized misogyny in myself and others. 

Any good recommendations of books that help break down internalized misogyny and help make it all a little easier to understand?

Sexual conversations,"Do you consider sexual conversations between coworkers (both genders) at the work place inappropriate ? My coworkers are always having this type of conversations.

How to fight back against normalisation of anti-women terrorism?,"Every woman - especially those who dared to speak out against misogyny in some form - experienced this. Men who create multiple accounts, to hound them, send them rape/death threats, how they want to stalk them online + offline and mutilate their bodies, men who invade women's spaces online and try to silence women by taking over the discussion, men who make anti-women jokes, men who then silence them by calling them overreacting and crazy. 

In the world of the internet, doing those deranged things has become very easy. And as excuses, we always hear that we ""need a thicker skin"", and ""it's not that bad"". But it is. 

The terror women face online (and offline) becomes increasingly more drastic by the day. Male supremacist terrorist groups like Incels, MGTOW, PUA, MRA, are recruiting and advertising more successfully on Social Media, Youtube, etc., reaching millions of followers. And boys who grew up with the internet and other male dominated areas (gaming, tech field) are socialised with these ideas from a very young age and think of it as normal. And even the popular p0rn categories are changing, and drifting from intercourse to abuse/mutilation/humiliation/murder/torture of women. 

We can't report it as a hate crime, as misogyny isn't even a category in most countries. We can't go to the police, as creating and deleting fake, anonymous accounts on reddit and other online platforms is a matter of 3 seconds. We can't go to our supervisors and principals, since no serious consequences are going to happen anyway. 

And I'm tired of those terrorist groups counting on the fact that we as women are soft and empathetic anyway, that we would always try to ""understand"" them, no matter how much they hate, molest, groom, assault, or straight-up slaughter us, and the security that we as women would never do those deranged things to them anyway. And what pissess me off most is how much these things are normalised and engrained in our culture already. 

How can we as women de-normalise these things? How can we defend ourselves? How can we fight back effectively? I'm personally feeling really powerless.",1
Is it mansplaining if an actual subject matter expert speaks in a condescending tone to a woman person ignorant in the subject?," [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k870cg2E4LM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k870cg2E4LM) 

Happened across this video while going down the YouTube rabbit hole and the question came to mind.

He clearly seems very annoyed at this person. And clearly she is ignorant in the subject matter. His body language and tone is extremely condescending.

Obviously if he was just some random guy who watched a lot of videos about submarines it'd be mansplaining. But he seems to be the person who knows the most about submarine capabilities in this country.

Do you feel this is mansplaining? Or is this just a case of a person being annoyed at the ignorance of another person?",1
Can a man be condescending to a woman without it being mansplaining?,"Just a question regarding definitions I had. I believe I understand the general idea of mansplaining decently well- here's my understanding: Women are generally (ofc. incorrectly) assumed to be inferior, less competent, less knowledgeable etc. and so it's sexist when a man unnecessarily explains something to a woman, especially if it's something women are expected to know much more about. 

My question is, how does that differ from just being condescending? Does a man being condescending to a woman always carry the connotation that the man expected/expects inferiority due to gender, consciously or not? Or is it not about the intent or the man's thought process at all, and is ""mansplaining"" just used to express the frustration of being talked down to by men in a world that is condescending to women, regardless of whether a particular incident was motivated by sexism or not?",1

How do/would you deal with rage release from random misogynists?,"In Japan, in a crowded place like a station and department store, there are misogynists who intentionally walk into women, and shove them away. I was recently victimized by three of them, respectively at a station, shopping mall, and in front of another station. The two of them came from behind, walked into me, and hit the right side of my back. The one came from my right side while I was looking up at the electronic arrival departure board, and shoved me away. I'm an average-sized woman, they were average-sized men, and it hurt.

None of 'em apologized, slowed down or stopped to check if I was okay, but just quickly walked away. I didn't say anything to them, because I was shocked, and also the people who show that level of savageness are total pieces of shit that never deserve any kind of my attention, energy, or time.

My anger towards them lingered on for a few days, not because of the physical pain, but because of their cowardliness and dirtiness: they targeted an innocent civilian who is smaller/weaker than them, and attacked her blind spots. (It is said in Japan that those cruel misogynists target pregnant women, women with strollers, and ones who look timid, dress modestly with less/no makeup ‚Äîthey never target someone like Tyra Banks)

I'm not a type of person who yells in public: 'You fucking asshole!"" or even ""Hey, you shoved me!!"" This may be the exact reason that they target me. 

I don't know if you encounter similar random misogynists or whatever, but how do/would you deal with irrational hostility from them?

Edit: This is a well-known phenomena in Japan and you can find vids that recorded the culprits on Twitter/YouTube. Japan Railway responded by upping patrols inside the station.

Institutions which restrict women,"This question is based on another post that I saw on this subreddit about boys night for male employees in the workplace.

1\] What if the women don't want to go out with us? And if we are anyways not that close with them, would it not count as sexual harassment to ask your woman colleague to join you outside of office? How do you know that the men are going to talk about sexist things? - In general human beings feel more comfortable with people who are similar to themselves, be it gender, race, language, or nationality.  In any case, even if they were to say sexist things, how is it anyone's business what anyone does outside of work - unless a crime is being committed, which can actually be prosecuted in the court of law? How would you even know that the male employees are having a boys night out, unless you are surveilling them or tracking their movements, and tracking what they say and do? 

2\] What is your take on the issue that girls can join boy scouts but the opposite is very problematic. Are safe spaces a concept only available to women? As an extension, do you think that women hanging around with other women is okay, but men should hang around with at least one women outside of work?

Why is it considered selfish/hypocritical of feminists to not highlight men's issues more,"I frequently come across so many posts where the caption are like ""just because a girl did this crime or horrible thing no feminist is saying anything "" , ""see , girls also do horrible objectification of men and harass men  sometimes but the feminists don't highlight it"" , "" why don't the feminists condemn fake rape cases as loudly as they support the #me too "" 
It seems like their issue is why feminists don't make more noise when the affected party is a male and the preparator is a female .  To be honest , I care a lot more about women's issues than those facing men because I am a woman . These things directly impact me and my day to day life . 

 These kind of questions feel like ,  why did Gandhi struggle so hard for the independence of India but not for the independence of australia .  Thats coz he was an Indian and cared much more about India right ? He probably wanted every nation to be independent but wished it much more for his own nation .

Objectification from the other side (and other questions),"Hey, so I had a couple of questions, based on some recent posts on this subreddit.

2\] Do you think ""locker room talk"" and ""boys will be boys"" is more prevalent in coed schools? I go to an all boys boarding school, and we never had something like ""locker room talk"" scenario \[could just be an anomaly though\].

I (18m) am a senior in high school and have been involved in various sports and extracurriculars throughout my last 4 years. I can say with certainty that my experiences have been generally positive. However, sometimes I feel uncomfortable when locker room talk occurs. Especially when the topic is about girls who go to our school. While I do my best to not participate, at times I catch myself lying about what I truly believe in only to fetch a few laughs. My efforts to change the topic or even out right end conversation almost always fall flat. I've tried conveying my perspective to 1 on 1s with my teammates, but their tendency reverts back over time.

Thoughts on the gendering of political parties?,"In US politics, the two political parties are often analogized (sometimes subliminally) using maternal and paternal characteristics. The ‚Äúmother‚Äù (see Democrats or left leaning) is perceived to have feminine priorities focused more on the people, while the ‚Äúfather‚Äù (Republican/conservative) is more focused on international or security affairs. Or whatever. 

Personally I‚Äôve always hated this comparison because 1) it‚Äôs too complicated to be so binary and heteronormative, and 2) it just further stigmatizes liberal issues, particularly anything that could even remotely benefit women. However, in context to what we‚Äôre seeing in present day (the blatant normalization of gaslighting, corruption, and lying on the side typically equated to masculinity) I‚Äôm starting to maybe understand why people who hold certain ideas towards women may be the ones who don‚Äôt see an issue with this type of behavior. Seems like there could be a direct correlation between people who are more likely to hold gross, victim blamey views about domestic violence and also dismiss the current actions of Trump, McConnell, and the Republican Party writ large.

When is anger the appropriate response?,"As my title stated, I don't know when anger is the appropriate response when someone (usually a guy) makes an offensive and/or sexist remark made in public, instead of educating them.

I understand that it is exhausting to educate people when it is your identity being attacked or questioned. But consider the following:

1) Information about the feminist movement isn't as accessible as people claim. Sure, it's on the internet and people can search it, but not everyone (especially in a third-world country) has access to the internet. And if they do have access to the internet, the references are usually in English and not in their local language or dialect, which means they still won't be able to access the information.

2) Once they were civilly (as in calmly explained why it's offensive and asked not to do it again) called out for their offensive language/behavior, the men in question were willing to make an effort to be less offensive because they were coming from a place of ignorance (see point 1).  When they were angrily (as in publicly shamed and shouted at) called out for their offensive language/behavior, the men in question just got angry as well.

Note, that I know that not all men who get called out for being offensive try to make themselves into better people. I would get angry at them too if I see similar offensive behavior from them after I've made an effort to educate them on why they're offensive.

I personally feel that being angry at ignorance isn't the best way to deal with offensive language/behavior (unless it's repeated behavior, then ignorance isn't an excuse). I understand it's difficult to assume that they're being ignorant, but I would rather first assume that when men's behavior/language becomes offensive, it was a mistake instead of being deliberate. 

(I would like to add that English is not my first language, and I'm not saying that anger is not a valid response. It's absolutely valid. I just feel that sometimes there are more appropriate responses.)",1
Financial Independence,"So this guy on Twitter was talking about ' Running it up till my wife can say ‚Äòa jobbb, I‚Äôm married??‚Äô and it immediately made me uncomfortable because for me personally, a man could be a billionaire, I am not comfortable being financially dependent on anyone and besides I like the career I want to get into one day.

But MANY women were appreciating it and asking for more men to have that mentality. I saw similar posts saying that its sexist for women to be expected to take financial responsibility while they don't have equal rights and its in fact empowering and feministic to not settle for men who don't make enough money (Lets not get into the classist implications of these) and work for them? Is it?  I am so confused.",1
"How to ""believe all women"" but also support Joe Biden (possible TW?)","I'm struggling to reconcile the facts that I genuinely like Joe Biden but he does have a sexual assault allegation against him (Tara Reade). As a woman, feminist and a survivor myself, I want to believe Tara by default, so I'm trying to think in a dialectal manner: Biden could have assaulted Reade in the 90s, but he has changed and is a good person now. But I worry that, by holding these two possible truths, I am actively participating in rape culture and condoning sexual assault.

So my question is: Do you believe that someone who assaulted a woman can change and become a good person? Is it ever permissible to then support that person?

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I'm exhausted so I'm sorry if this is poorly written!

Edit: I‚Äôm not saying I support everything Biden stands for. As someone mentioned, he supported the Hyde Amendment for a long time, and I find that disgusting. I don‚Äôt agree w his,
and most Americans‚Äô, kink for capitalism. But still, I don‚Äôt want to condemn him fully for his past bc, imo, people can change. I used to be ignorant af (I won‚Äôt go into what that entailed bc I am ashamed of it) but then I went to college in a big city and learned about the real world and other ways of thinking. I hope that people can see how different I am now and not write me off immediately for how I was in the past.
I would also like to add that (and this is probably going to be a lot of identifying info about me) I went to Georgetown and lived in that neighborhood. I went to the same movie theater and ice cream shop that Biden goes to. There‚Äôs a photo of him (not like a photo op thing, like a passerby took the photo) speaking w a man experiencing homelessness outside of the AMC, and as someone who worked w people experiencing homelessness in the Gtown neighborhood, I really was touched by that. People experiencing homelessness get thrown to the wayside and ignored, as if they‚Äôre not human. But Biden took time to acknowledge this man‚Äôs existence and say ‚ÄúI see you.‚Äù Most people won‚Äôt even look at a person experiencing homelessness  or say hello when they pass by. The fact that Biden did just that shows hella character in my opinion.",1
Does anyone else feel the 'strong female' characters on Netflix shows are terribly written?,"So i don't really identify as a feminist , but i feel that the recent trend of incorporating 'strong female' characters on shows is actually not what it looks like bcuz most of the characters on the shows are terribly written , they seem to portray powerful women as bitchy and complaining , basically they all look like what your typical 50 year old male thinks when he visualises feminist or strong woman.



My favourite female characters on shows were the ones on Peaky blinders, Kim from better call Saul and Sara Lance ( Arrow, legends of tomorrow) .",1

"What's up with calling women ""sweet""?","Hi everyone! I'm doing a long overdue deep dive into feminism and there's something that's been bugging me that I can't figure out. I was wondering if anyone had feminist insight or suggested readings/media on it. I'm a late-comer so apologies if it's basic.

I've noticed that I get praised a lot for being ""sweet"" but at the same time often told that I'm too sweet and that makes me weak. I'm told this most often by boyfriends. So, when I'm kind and understanding to a boyfriend or someone he thinks deserves it, I'm so great. But, if I'm kind and understanding with someone he thinks doesn't deserve it, I'm too nice and need to stand up for myself. The other inconsistency with this is kindness or sweetness appears to be a quality that is appreciated in me, as a woman and a girlfriend, but not something that is an aspiring universal characteristic. What I mean by this is, a boyfriend will see sweetness as my best trait, but will not see it as a trait that is important for him to emulate. So, it's great that I'm patient and kind but a man will make no effort to be so and does not desire to be so. I've even seen this represented in media. For example, I saw a T.V. show where one of the characters said to his wife that she is so kind and that's his favorite thing about her. But, she's too kind and that's why she needs him to protect her.  This was the line that ended a disagreement between them about how to proceed with a moral dilemma.  

If I praise a characteristic in another person, it's something I admire, wish I had and strive to be better at. Given all the inconsistencies with an individual's and society's perception of sweetness, I can't shake the feeling of being patronized and disrespected when it's brought up, even in a positive manner. Something feels insidious when the characteristic my partner values the most in me is a characteristic he also tells me is a weakness and is something he doesn't value in himself. Thanks in advance for any help!",1
Workplace dress code and sexism,"Got into a heated discussion with my friends with regards to this

Basically I am a guy and I work in the banking and finance industry and I notice that many ladies are dressing increasingly in a manner that I feel is beginning to feel uncomfortable in terms of how revealing it is. I am taking about bare backs or skirts with slits. Or extremely short skirts that I would associate with a club. This happens all the time and even more so on a casual friday

So I mentioned that why don't we have the same professional standards in terms of dress codes for guys and girls? Even for casual Fridays some level of decorum should be observed. 

My stance was that too revealing clothing could distract (I know in am ideal world Ur colleagues should not objectify you but we don't live in an ideal world). This creates a safe environment for both men and women. Women don't get objectified. Everyone focuses on their work and go home. 

The immediate response was that I was sexist and misogynistic. Their stance was women should be free to wear whatever they want. It's my own fault for being disturbed. 

So I am conflicted. If men are supposed to follow a certain standards why is it misogynistic to suggest the same for ladies at a workplace? I mean men can't exactly wear revealing outfits at work at all. 

Another argument they put is that dressing doesn't affect how professional a person is. But I find that this arguement is irrelevant as it applies for both gender. I mean in that case men should be able to wear anything they want too. And we all know men can't exactly go to work in berms etc either 

So the question is: should there be a professional limit to how revealing a workplace dress code should be? Should men and women have the same standard and expectations with regards to dress code?",1

Understanding part of an article about masculinity and misogyny in 2000s emo/pop punk,"I read [this](https://themuse.jezebel.com/the-miserable-business-of-emo-masculinity-1845304316) really interesting article the last night and it makes a lot of really good points. There's one section that I just don't understand, though. I wanted to ask people on here about it because I thought the rest of the article was very reasonable and I am a man who has minimal experience with feminist thought. The part I was confused by was about halfway through the article, and the text is:

&gt; Hayley Williams, as stated previously, is an obvious exception, though she, too, was not immune to those cultural oppressions, as evidenced in ‚ÄúMisery Business.‚Äù ‚Äúi‚Äôm a proud feminist, just maybe not a perfect one?‚Äù¬†she wrote in 2015, apologizing for the song‚Äôs ‚Äúvery narrow-minded perspective.‚Äù It‚Äôs worth noting that she is one of very few emo performers of the time that have apologized for their less-than-savory songwriting, and I can‚Äôt help but think that as one of the few women in the scene, she‚Äôs been tasked with carrying the brunt of it. For example: Daryl Palumbo of Glassjaw¬†told¬†Alternative Press¬†in 2017, after¬†Pitchfork‚Äôs Jenn Pelly¬†brought up the lyrics¬†to ‚ÄúPretty Lush,‚Äù that when he wrote the song he was ‚Äúa young guy, and I was supposed to be a man and I was not. I apologize for saying any of that... I was small-minded when I should‚Äôve been a man,‚Äù reinforcing an idea that goodness, doing the right thing, owning up to mistakes‚Äîis an expression of manliness, what is masculine. It also continues to refuse to give agency to the women he villainized.

I don't really understand the author's interpretation of Pelly's quote. To me the quote reads like a fine apology, but it seems like she's using it to demonstrate that Williams is being held to a higher standard (""she‚Äôs been tasked with carrying the brunt of it""). I also don't understand how this quote ""continues to refuse to give agency to the women he villainized"", or why ""reinforcing an idea that goodness, doing the right thing, owning up to mistakes‚Äîis an expression of manliness, what is masculine"" is a bad thing. Have I misunderstood how she's using the quote from the interview, or am I lacking the perspective to see why the quote is so egregious?",1

Why don‚Äôt we talk about female veterans more?,"It‚Äôs Veterans Day! First of all, happy vets day to all my sisters. 

Women veterans are a group of people that is often overlooked. As a woman veteran, I personally dislike this holiday because of how overlooked we are. I‚Äôve seen many women veterans discriminated against both within and outside of the veteran community. 

Here‚Äôs a small example: Today, I went out with my friends to celebrate Veterans Day. We went to a restaurant that offers free meals to all veterans. When it was my time to order, the waiter actually refused to accept my status. He said that they do not give meals to spouses. I showed him my veteran ID, and he stated that it was ‚Äúfake‚Äù. For the record, I am a veteran who served in Afghanistan, female, 25 years old, and overweight. I don‚Äôt look like what people imagine vets look like (Middle Aged white men wearing a baseball cap with various attention-seeking embellishments).

Within the veteran community and during interpersonal interactions, people often ask me to ‚Äúprove‚Äù my service. They‚Äôll ask me to show them my ID or other identifying paperwork. Which is weird... because if you tell someone that you worked at Amazon, do they insist on employee identification, or do they just take your word for it?

Also, the VA itself does the absolute bear minimum for its female veterans. I have to drive 2 hours to see a gyno, when I live right next to a VA facility. Why? Because they don‚Äôt bother having a woman‚Äôs health clinic in all of their facilities.",1

I used to be apart of it, when I was a young boy. Sorta. I read and watched things from the fandom and have many criticisms and such for it.

The Dreaded Thermostat 2: The Revenge Reloaded,"Thought of just asking a light weight question. I work in an office with 1-2 other coworkers. My bossman isn't here everyday, so lots of the times it's me and my coworker (18F). Anyway, we have a little bit of a non-serious conflict. She likes the room temp to be 78. I prefer it to be 71. I remember learning that on a physical level, males and females do seem to have different temperature preferences. When she first started working here, I was like 'holy crap it's hot in here' and turned it down to 72. She said that she was basically freezing. So we compromised, I bought a small desk fan and we agreed that 75F was the temperature we would work in. 

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, this isn't about seeking advice. I'm just curious if feminists here encounter a similar problem. Is it always cold where you work? Do you wear jackets and coats at work? What experiences have you had with the thermostat. If you have issues, do they extend to the home or is this a work culture issue?

Is it ethical/okay to masturbate to pictures of celebrities and other public figures?,"Hi yall, I just had a question about masturbating to celebrities and other public figures. I know that it is not uncommon for people to masturbate to them, but I don't think that's a reason for it being ethical/okay (popular =/= right). I was wondering what yall's thoughts were.

My thinking is that celebrities and other public figures don't necessarily consent to their pictures being sexualized and used for the purpose of masturbation. There's a lack of consent, and it seems unethical and disrespectful then to masturbate to pictures of them. Like I do understand that they post pictures in the public, so they then consent to the public viewing it. But that doesn't necessarily mean that they consent to people masturbating to it. Then again, when someone does masturbate to them, the celebrity/public figure doesn't know. Not sure how to make of this.

I was also thinking about a related scenario, about how it is disrespectful to masturbate to people you know and other friends. Like for people you know, it's objectifying and creepy to masturbate to pictures that they post like that. And I guess I'm asking, is there a difference between friends and celebrities here? Like if it isn't okay to masturbate to people you know, why would it be then acceptable/okay to masturbate to people you don't know. Is there any distinction in the first place?

Thanks again for reading this.",1
"What do you think of women who claim to be okay with abortion, but then characterize pro-choice as being only pro-abortion?","Today I came across a video on TikTok made by a woman who claims to be a women‚Äôs rights advocate as well as an advocate for LGBTQ people. The video that she created was one where she said that pro-choice people are only pro abortion, and it was confusing because she claims to be a women‚Äôs rights advocate who has no problem with abortions. Though, she consistently demonizes people who believe that abortions should be a route that women/ trans-men can take if they want to. It seems that she consistently uses pro life rhetoric when talking about pro-choice people, and also uses trans-men as a shield when she‚Äôs called out on that. She says that she is not pro-life because she supports women and trans-men getting sterilized. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what to say in order to combat her rhetoric that pro-choice people only ever push for abortions. I know that this isn‚Äôt true, because every pro-choice person I know advocates for all of it being legal and accessible (abortion, birth control, and sterilization). She pushes the narrative that pro-choice people want everyone to just have abortions as birth control instead of advocating for sterilization and birth control, which is obviously untrue.

"As a Gender &amp; Women‚Äôs studies major, how do I deal with the comments I get for pursuing such a stigmatized degree?","I‚Äôm an undergraduate student pursuing a GWS major at a prestigious university, and while my friends and family have both been extremely supportive, I still run into plenty of criticism and rude comments about how ‚Äúuseless‚Äù my degree is, and/or why it isn‚Äôt lucrative. While I agree the job prospects after graduation aren‚Äôt as plentiful as they would be for a STEM major or medical school, I have two highly successful family members who had majored in history and English, respectively, and both ended up with great careers, albeit in completely different fields. 

While I firmly believe the subject matter is important, and that most of the criticisms I face are based off of ignorance and stereotypes, I‚Äôd be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt make me doubt myself from time to time.

Why is male privilege a bad thing?,"I mean, don't human beings have ""human privilege"" by which we justify mass killing of chickens, cows, and pigs to meet our food requirements, because we are more powerful then they are. Don't women want to dominate the world just as men do, it's just that they can't because men won't allow them to, since they have power? My point is, isn't this just the natural order of things, like why don't we have rabbits at the top of the food chain instead of lions? The British Empire was able to rule in Asia because it's policies were better and it won wars there, and thus was the stronger one - If Asia were able to win the wars, we would have had an Asian empire. My theory is the victory in a war determines who will rule, and at some point in time matriarchial governments lost to patriarchial ones, consistently.

With many world governments becoming feminist \[except some like China\], do you think feminists will be able to topple governments in the future? How will you fare against military dictatorships in a civil war? Also, do you think feminists would be able to seize control in China/Russia/India/Middle-East one day?

Also, if I am a man, and if what feminism says is true - that men have all the power, why should I voluntarily want to cede my power, without even a fight or a war?

My main issue is, if it was the matriarchy in power, you would have treated men the same way. Now that we have a feminist government in the US, under meToo, a woman can falsely accuse a man of sexual assault and he can directly go to jail without a trial \[happened in many universities\], because all women are to be believed. Like, how is this fair, even murderers get a fair trial. And there are also other things like Marriage / Divorce Law exploitation. Just think about this, if most college graduates today are women, and most criminals are men, and even uneducated women can earn money via marriage+divorce / onyfans+Instagram+Twitch, what's stopping uneducated young men from joining criminal organizations? Yes, you can break the glass ceiling, but you also cannot prevent the impending chaos on the floor.  ",1
Do you ever attribute anything good to the patriarchy?,"I've heard the patriarchy be blamed for just about everything wrong with society.

Given that society has both good and bad elements, is it fair to also attribute some positive aspects of society to the patriarchy? Things like law, order, science, democracy, etc.? Granted one can say that these things could have occurred in a world without the patriarchy, but we can say the same about the negative things. Racism, classism and war could just as easily occurred under a matriarchy.

Do other women feel scared running alone in public?,"Today I was talking to a friend about how I was too scared to run alone without my phone (I wouldn‚Äôt have anything to put my phone in to take with me).

I‚Äôm sure most women have experienced at some point being harassed and cat called in public. Even with other people with you or around it still happens. My friend then says he doesn‚Äôt think running alone is a risk and women shouldn‚Äôt be scared as kidnappings and sexual assault doesn‚Äôt happen much, especially in the area we live in. Upon googling it, I found an article on a 15 year old girl had been kidnapped and raped in our area, published 3 days ago. I told him this and he didn‚Äôt believe me and asked to have a look at the article. He then read through and said ‚Äúthis says he was charged but never proven‚Äù (which I later found out it never said in the article but anyway...). I let him know stuff like this was hard to prove and it‚Äôs very unlikely this 15 year old child was making it up. To which he then said ‚Äúwell it is a definite possibility‚Äù. 

This is what really bothered me as false rape allegations are only 2%-4% of all rape cases. I let him know this, but he said I was wrong and ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt talk about things I know nothing about‚Äù. 

I finished the conversation there but this really upset and annoyed me. I wanted to see if anyone agreed with me that this whole thing is ridiculous and that women have so many reasons to be scared to go out alone, especially without a phone.

"Should there be female equivalent of the word ""guy""?","There should be a simple, short, connotation-free, all age inclusive, non-formal way to refer to women in my opinion.

Girl/gal seems infantilizing and besides it has an upper age limit, chick/darling/honey/love is patronizing/sexual. Lady is too formal, woman is slightly better, but it is also longer and doesn't seem to flow out of the tongue as easy as something like guys. For instance compare ""Sup guys?"" to ""Sup women?"" The feel is just awkward and clumsy.

And that is why I believe a new word should be created, which has the same meaning as ""guy"" but for women/girls.

wlw in patriarchy,"Okay this is probably not quite the right subreddit but I trust you guys and honestly couldn't find a better suited place for this question. Would appreciate any direction towards other subreddits that might be more directly related to my question.

&amp;#x200B;

So: I recently admitted to myself that I am bi. And now I can't stop thinking about how patriarchy has shaped my perspective on other women. Like I know I have always found women attractive but there's also the over-sexualisation of women everywhere and the competition (especially looks-wise) between women that has influenced how I percieve other women. For the past 10 years whenever I looked at a woman my first thought was ""oh but is she skinnier/prettier than me"" instead of idk appreciating her beauty individually. 

And now as I am coming to terms with my sexuality and society I am looking for any content (books, podcasts, youtube videos..) discussing this (as I am surely not the first or only person to struggle with this), either on a personal experience level or a more societal/cultural level.

Any good historic books about feminism?,"For what i've seen so far the majority of feminist books suggestions are center around the living practice and theory of feminism; instead of the roots that got them there. I know that a movement must be in constant *movement*. But I genuinely regard the past of an ideology of being the most crucial part of it, it cements bases, reasons and legitimacy, that being done by the rejection of said past (race-segmented upper-class feminism) the celebration of it (female suffrage, educational desegregation, reproductive rights, etc) or the continuation of it (the fight for equal rights).

A question about Monogamy and Sex,"To start, I would describe myself as a forward thinking, progressive socialist and intersectional feminist man. 

I've recently been pondering inceldom and how this community, naturally made up of mostly broken or lonely men, believes that women hold power and privilege over them by being attractive and having sexual power, despite women being conditioned by men to be the gatekeepers of sex per gender roles and societal tradition, i.e. ""the patriarchy"". 

However I had ran into a question that made me rethink things. I thought to myself: if I'm as gender abolitionist and a strong believer in a free, consensual, safe and positive sex world where both men and women of all types hold power, is monogamy a bad personal value/practice to hold? Like polycules and taboo relationships (within general reason) are at the forefront of being liberating for both men and women and yet I'm still subscribed to notions of a loyal, traditional relationship where it is me and my one solitary partner. Essentially, I still get jealous, believe in the concept of cheating, etc. 

To be honest I think I've just thought about the overall topic too much but I thought the question wasn't-- awful. So I thought I'd post it here. 

Tl;dr is monogamy sexist/a bad value to hold as a self described progressive?

I'm concerned I'm becoming a TERF. Would like insight,"Hey guys. I want to start this off by saying I promise I am coming at this from a place of good faith-- I am not here to concern troll or play obtuse to push an agenda. My questions come from a sincere place of wanting to understand, and my doubts are genuinely ones I wish to clear up. On top of that, I've identified as nonbinary and used they/them pronouns for the past few years. I still want to continue doing that, but being AFAB *has* always been very important in my view of my identity &amp; I've spent most of my time in queer spaces in WLW ones.

Recently, I've found my way to gender critical corners of the internet and I've found myself troubled with how much it seems to... make sense? A *lot* of what people have said they believe seems like either a purposeful misinterpretation of their discourse or a complete fabrication. I want to be able to discuss them somewhere where I can air out all of my thoughts and honestly work through them. I think it's dangerous to be unable to hold your beliefs up to scrutiny &amp; would much rather have a discussion on my thoughts, rather than internalize them. I'm using a throwaway because I'm vaguely nervous (I know it does not inspire confidence).

Now, let's get out of the way all the ways I *don't* agree with terfs. 

* **I believe trans women can still meaningfully experience misogyny.** Trans women who pass are treated, by all accounts and purposes, the same as cis women. People don't bother checking your genitals before proceeding forth. More on this + especially more on passing later.

* **Transphobia is a thing that exists.** More than anything, what I believe in is looking at the material results as indicators for what theory should be. Theory that has absolutely no substance outside of hypothetical conversations is meaningless. Looking at people's lived experiences, I can say with certainty that transphobia exists and significantly impacts people's lives. Trans people are at heightened risk for assault + verbal abuse,  the trans youth suicide rate, etc etc. 

* **Trans women cannot neatly be placed in the same class as cis men.** The lived experiences of trans women are markedly &amp; observably different than cis men. They are not afforded the same privileges in society when presenting as trans women, trans people do not occupy the highest positions of power, and the societal systems set up to benefit cis men often actively harm trans women. Grouping up cis men and trans women does not make sense when you are analyzing things through the lens of lived experience.

* **Bathrooms are really not a problem**. Don't really know what else ought to be said here. There does not seem to be a particular pattern of trans women assaulting cis women in bathrooms. 


With that being said, here are the things that seem to make a relative amount of sense to me &amp; that I agree with:

* **Sex-based oppression exists.** The way societies interact with you depends heavily on what you are assigned at birth, which again, correlates nearly 1:1 to what genitalia you have. Abortion rights, menstruation, absolutely everything about the degrading way vaginas are treated, are issues solely faced by people with female or AFAB reproductive systems, whatever terminology you want to apply. Medical science is hugely focused on the male body &amp; thus the specific ways illness &amp; disease manifests in females is left direly unknown. Issues that are female specific, like endometriosis, are ridiculously under-researched despite the massive percentage of people it affects. Sex selective abortions exist. There is no way, for me, to deny that AMAB bodies are privileged over AFAB ones. 

* **Trans women do not face sex based oppression &amp; I am rather conflicted on if cis women meaningfully oppress trans women**. I think what has become enlightening in how misogyny is framed for me, is understanding that passing trans women face misogyny *because* of the assumption they have a vagina. Misogyny is deeply rooted in the assumption of a female body &amp; is almost inextricable from that. Amongst anti-GC people, I have seen this point + the previous one framed as 'terfs reducing women down to their bodies' but I find this to be a profoundly misleading and borderline dishonest reading. It's not reducing people down to their biology to observe how they're treated by society. I think people take 'trans women do not experience sex-based oppression' to be a *prescriptive* statement barring trans women from accessing something, but I find it to be more of a *descriptive*, value-neutral explanation. What makes me doubtful about my own understanding of what gender critical beliefs actually entail, is that I have often read claims that the gender critical crowd 'define womanhood by ability to make babies' but this understanding of sex based oppression is pointedly... not that? Not only is it reductive, but it seems actively misogynistic to see talking about sex-based oppression &amp; vaginas through the lens of ""making babies,"" as if that is the only context the female reproductive system exists in. To automatically go from lets discuss how female reproductive systems are treated by society to 'making babies' is.... bad. 

* Onto explaining my thoughts of cis women not being oppressors-- cis womanhood is in itself oppressive. Sex based oppression means that having a vagina... can in no way truly be a privilege, imo. I think this is particularly true in non-Western countries. Cis women do not *meet* patriarchal standards of womanhood by having a vagina, they are *subjected* to them. While cis women and trans women both face different struggles, I do not see any way that the constructs &amp; systems of gender/sex benefit cis women over trans women. The trans murder rate is actually rather comparable to the rate at which cis women are murdered every year. Analyzing the statistics is important to understand the source of material harm.  *80%* of the trans women murdered in 2019 were TWOC, and specifically impoverished women of color who are sex workers. Trans women of color, in particular black and Latina transfeminine people, are disproportionately at risk but the axis their oppression is coming from seems to be deeply embedded in poverty &amp; racism. White trans women are insulated from this unique harm. 

* **Female and male socialization do occur &amp; this extends to trans people.** I am AFAB. Being AFAB deeply affected how I was raised, how I was spoken to, the expectations that were put upon me-- literally every aspect of me is shaped by this. I do not think trans women experience female socialization, and I do not understand any argument that they do. Even if a trans woman may have internalized messages about what women are expected to be like, this is an internal experience instead of an external one. A trans woman does not go through the external experience of female socialization-- it is more than notions you accept about womanhood, but the manner in which people interact with you, the interests that the adults around you sought to cultivate in you, the way in which society treats you. I actually think this line of reasoning clearly represents a disconnect in these sorts of conversations-- the internal reality vs the external reality. Gender critical thought seems to prioritizing the external. 

* -&gt; I have seen trans women who said they experienced female socialization because they were seen as effeminate men but that is... not the same? Effeminate men are not treated similarly to women, at all. It seems to be a misunderstanding of female socialization, that what it represents is 'the way you are treated when you're feminine' instead of 'the way you are treated when you're AFAB.' Moreso, it discounts non-feminine AFAB people &amp; bizarrely denies them the right to discuss female socialization by framing it around personal behavior instead of how society treats you.

* **I am not certain cis womanhood &amp; trans womanhood is similar enough to place in the same class.** To loop back to my point earlier on how I don't think trans women belong in the same class as cis men, but simultaneously, I think trans womanhood is sufficiently different enough from cis womanhood that it does them both a disservice to place them in the same class. I don't think it provides coherent analysis. Like... the framework of the childhood of a cis &amp; trans girl (or anyone AFAB) are fundamentally different. For example, many trans women talk about the experience of wanting to do feminine things but not being allowed to because of societal gender roles. This is intrinsically not the experience of anyone AFAB- even if an AFAB person was shamed for being feminine, it is not on the same terms as an AMAB person. As an AFAB person, you are not shamed for being feminine because you're not living up to gender standards and you are emasculating yourself, but because femininity is frivolous, because AFAB people are frivolous. Conversely, growing up a tomboy is inherently not something AMAB will go through-- even if they had purportedly ""tomboy"" interests, because it's not merely the internal experience, but the external, material experience of living through society &amp; how it behaves towards you.  

* -&gt; I recognize the argument against this is 'not all women had identical childhoods, another axis of oppression will impact how you navigate through the world, i.e a rich woman and a poor woman, etc.' I have considered that, but the rebuttal that makes most sense to me is 'those are *separate* factors that affect gender, whilst this is about is about the fundamental nature of gender. The ways that a poor woman &amp; a rich woman would differ in their experience of sex &amp; gender are related to the distinct, separate socioeconomic factors that cause them to contend with gender differently, while the ways trans women and cis women differ is on the base experience of gender itself. 

* **Trans women who do not pass experience transphobia, but not misogyny.** I actually think that what trans women experience is more analogous to homophobia than it is misogyny. Often the harm that comes with trans women is not based on misogyny, but on the assumptions about gender nonconforming men. The way it manifests, the language and slurs used, the specific type of violence that arises all correlate with &amp; are more coherently described by homophobia rather than misogyny. Of course, oppression is not so cleanly cut &amp; homophobia is itself deeply intertwined with misogyny. To go out on a limb, I am not sure if internalized misogyny is a coherent system to discuss trans women in the context of, because much of internalized misogyny is wrapped up in female socialization. 

* **Gender abolition is the end goal.** I do not think there is any 'essence' of womanhood. I think that being trans exists because well, gender is around, and the people have gotta deal with it somehow. Blaming the systems of gender on trans people is pointing the gun in the wrong direction. Regardless, I believe it bears some... analysis on a wider societal scale on what it means when someone thinks of herself as woman specifically because she is more feminine. I suppose I do agree with the gender critical people when they say it has become dogmatic to not critically discuss this. I have realized that I feel uncomfortable when people talk about passing or presenting female by prescribing a list of gender roles, or when people say they knew they were a girl because they never enjoyed ""boy"" activities. What does this *mean* about what it means to be a woman.

* **I have observed a certain amount of fetishists in the community.** This is the point I am most concerned about when I say I worry I am absorbing TERF beliefs. I really hesitate to even say this, because I truly don't believe all trans women are fetishists &amp; I do not want to contribute to harm against them. But as someone who is nonbinary(????) &amp; has hung out in a lot of online trans spaces, I do... recognize? a certain demographic of people. I have seen a not-insignificant amount of trans woman say degrading &amp; misogynistic things about vaginas &amp; women in general, in a way I distinctly haven't seen in transmasc spaces. I don't necessarily want to dwell on the specifics because I'm don't wish to turn this stuff into a peanut gallery. I am also not here to write off every single trans women for the crimes of minority- a misogynistic cis woman is as common as a day ending in y. I don't know. My thoughts are jumbled here. Maybe this is linked to the extent in which trans women are sexualized in all media they appear in.

* To digress a little, I actually think nonbinary people are doing gender abolition in a better &amp; more material way than terfs are. Nonbinary people who say 'fuck it, this rock is my gender' are doing a better job upending the system and the notion that gender is a meaningful category. I wish this was coming with more discussions of sex-based oppression, however, which I find has been completely removed from the conversation.

* **Genital preferences are not transphobic.** I'm putting this at the bottom of this list because I think terfs severely overrepresent this as an issue. Most trans people who are not extremely online agree with this. The vast majority of trans people don't seem to think of genital preferences as transphobic but I do agree there is a strain in online discourse where people believe this. Same goes for trans people in sports. 

Whew. This is getting long. I probably have even more to say, but I'll cut myself off here. Once again, I really want to stress that I'm not concern trolling, I just have nowhere to go with these thoughts &amp; I wanted to have genuine insight from people who are not TERFs. Please let me know if there's a better subreddit to post to than this one! I know this is less of a question, and more of a word-vomit asking for feedback.

On a scale of 1 to 10 how much do you feel you truly grasp the bubble men are in? Does it change your approach towards communication?,"As a dude who's gone from being completely oblivious, to being feminist...it's been kind of amazing looking back to just how blind and in a bubble I was.  And how easy it was to be blind / how much effort it took to see outside of it... even though I consider myself a very curious person.  It's been my personal experience that men and women I know just have a helluva time grasping the other's perspective because their lived day to day experience is so vastly different.  Day to day the men I know don't see or hear a lot of the issues women deal with at all, so they have a tendency to think it's more of a rare edge case thing and doubt women when it is brought up (as well as for patriarchal reasons of course).  The  women I know (even very feminist ones) can't unsee the issues, deal with them day in and day out, and feel like it's so obvious and self evident that they can't imagine how anyone can not see it and will assume any disagreement comes from a truly malicious place.  (This is not to say there aren't malicious men because of course there are.  And this is not an excuse or endorsement of bad behavior on men's part, my intent is to highlight how this affects communication around feminism. )   


Having been in the bubble I feel like it really changes my approach when trying to convert other men. I'm like damn, how am I gonna convince them this is a real thing, when I know just how hard it is to actually see it unless they are under certain conditions.  And when they resist a feminist issue,  I'm more apt to say ""look I get it, it seems counterintuitive doesn't it?

"Do feminists usually support male-only scholarships (or similar things), in fields where men are underrepresented?","To preface this with some information, I am a white man and I support female-only scholarships in fields like STEM. However, a few years ago I probably wouldn't have. I'd like to think, that I was always fairly progressive, but my views on feminism (and perhaps some others) were not. In recent years I've been trying to ""improve myself"", and educating myself on views I felt challenged on is part of that.

Now to get back to the question: 

I do believe that men-only scholarships in fields where they are underrepresented is probably a good idea, and I'm curious what you guys think about it.

I understand that (white) men are not a marginalized group, however I still believe that every field could profit from a balance in gender and race distributions (different life experiences, etc.).

I was also wondering what percentage in gender distribution, or female quotas in other areas should be the ""cut-off point"". Would, for example, a 40-60 split be enough? From what I understand and believe a huge imbalance is not natural and is caused by our cultural views. Could a small imbalance however be ""natural"" in certain fields? I'm not sure, maybe some of you could help me understand.",1

How do I explain to my professor what is wrong with a sexist meme he used to illustrate his lecture?,"I am in my first year of psychology at a Dutch university, and I saw an image being used in a lecture about research methods that struck me as being sexist and unfit for serious educational use. It was an image of a young, blonde woman making a duckface while sitting exaggeratedly dramatical on a chair and taking a selfie. The caption of the image was '' Scientists have announched a new unit to accurately measure narcissism: the selfie per hour.''I feel that this is a sexist portrayal of women, and I have decided to write my professor a letter to let him know I think it is inappropriate to use sexist jokes without adequate criticism, but I'm having a hard time explaining why exactly this image is sexist.So far I have the arguments that images like this have been used by people to falsely portray women as vain and stupid, the argument that a bigger percentage of narcissists is male, and the argument that this way of measuring is scientifically irresponsible. But I feel that I might be missing something important. Does anyone have insights on the subject?Thank you in advance for sharing your thoughts!

"Is saying ""there's not a lot of women in competitive gaming"" wrong?","Before I begin - I ask for explanation, and not for trouble. If I caused offense - I didn't know, so I will apologise for any caused in advance, and please kindly explain to me what that was.

I was watching ""The Queen's Gambit"" with my friend. In the first episode, the main character plays against a man in a room full of men (setting is 1967 Paris) and she noted that the room is full of men.

I said yeah - I guess that was the social norm back then. Come to think of it, I think there's not a lot of women in competitive gaming even now.

Upon hearing this, my friend said that there are women out there who would shred me to parts (or so to speak) for saying things like that.

So here's my first question: did I speak out of place? To me, it was stating a social norm, but can that be heard/interpreted in a different way? Please feel free to make your own assumptions about how I've said it, my tone, or facial expression, or cultures/background/professions we're from. Or even my general attitude that she may have observed other than this interaction. If it happens to be the case where I phrased this question in a way that sounded like I'm the reasonable one - it's probably because I'm the one telling the story, and missing out the part of the story where she did sound reasonable.

A side-question related to this topic is: do you guys agree with my overall opinion about the state of the gaming community?

The gender ratio differs significantly between game genres, and **women are highly underrepresented in genres such as** [**first-person shooters**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter) **and** [**grand strategy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_strategy_wargame) **games.** [Sexism in video gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism_in_video_gaming), including [sexual harassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment), as well as [underrepresentation of women as characters in games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_representation_in_video_games), is an increasing topic of discussion in [video game culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_culture).

"How do we square tolerance, autonomy, and science on the subject of childhood transitioning? And can this conversation be had?","Thank you for reviewing my question. I have been struggling with this myself and I would like some feedback. If you care enough to look into my post history you will see I am a progressive intersectional feminist who supports trans rights. I did find some criticisms surrounding organizations like Mermaids to be valid, and I have struggled to arrive at a conclusion after reading several books, endless articles, etc. 


There has been a rise in children identifying as trans and a rise in the public profile of organizations like Mermaids that assist children in transitioning. 


Changing attitudes around childhood transitioning are controversial and divide feminists. 


Detransition data, particularly regarding young people, is of poor quality with few studies. There are some red flags. We can find numerous individual accounts of children detransitioning, we know that the young brain displays the most neuroplasticity, and we can say with some confidence that the recent jump in self-identifying trans children contains an appreciable number of confused or mistaken children, based on an understanding of how human populations work, and a lack of explanation for this spike that is based in sociological or biological reality. 


The laws in most places rule out hormone intervention until the mid teens, but there is an effort to deregulate this. 


How do we as feminists deal with these competing forces? Are the current laws adequate? Do we need to deregulate these choices or further regulate the process? When can a child actually consent to begin transitioning? Perhaps most importantly, how do we weigh the desires of patients and beliefs that early transitioning will be highly beneficial with the potential lifelong risks?


Edit: Thanks for the replies. I have to be away from my phone for a while and will check back later. I think this was helpful and it went better than I thought it would.

Should there be a different way to educate men on feminism?,"A lot of men seem to disregard feminism because the issues discussed at hand aren't directly experienced by them, so they assume women to be exaggerating. They find it hard to empathize with and think feminists are asking for too much. As ridiculous as that is, it's still important to get men to become feminists as they can help amplify the voices of women who aren't being heard.

A few years ago, the thing that seemed to attract me to feminism was the idea that men benefit from gender equality too. I realized that a lot of men's issues (ex. not being allowed to show emotion) was in some way related  how patriarchal our society is. On a dating related note, many men complain about women like taller men, but there has been research that it's because of unrealistic beauty standards towards women and how men feel emasculated by taller women and such. It was interesting and I think research like that can help get men on board.

I think the best way to educate men would be to discuss how issues like this can be solved so they can empathize with the gender inequality, but I'd love to hear what suggestions you have!",1
"Exploring my biases: My hang up with feminism, I believe white supremacy is more of issue than patriarchy?","I've always consider myself an anti-feminist.

Not only that, but it seems to me it is within POCs' best interest  to fight white supremacy, regardless  of gender, than patriarchy. I get  intersectionality  but even still white supremacy  is more harmful to women of color than patriarchy.  

Also, time and time again without family  white women have shown to value whiteness over  womanhood (generally  speaking). I'm not sure how women of color can fully trust women that can play both sides of the fense...

Depp Vs Heard: Thoughts Post Libel Dismissal?,"The Depp vs Heard abuse story and then libel trial have attracted a lot of attention, a lot of emotions, and a lot of conflicting information.

I‚Äôm not educated in legal matters, especially in the UK, but it sounds like these finding were based on evidence and a chance to appeal is unlikely to be granted.

I find stories that involve celebrities and optics often show our cultural biases in how they are presented in media, and that Depp‚Äôs abuse of Heard and her subsequent public reception is indicative of how far we need to go culturally when discussing abuse, as the public sympathy seemed to swing to Depp as soon as Heard became less than perfect.

"Are fraternities becoming more progressive, and do they serve as a positive influence for young men?","I‚Äôve been in a fraternity for 4 years now and I can look back on a lot of positive ways it has affected my brothers and me, but I‚Äôve also seen negative influences go unchecked. As a queer man, I‚Äôm glad that brothers from all over the country are exposed to LGBT brothers, sometimes for the first time. I faced way less homophobia than I thought I would because of the brave gay men who came before me. When our house was smaller (25 guys total) everyone kept an eye on each other and made sure brothers weren‚Äôt taking unknown girls to their rooms alone after heavy drinking. We learned to be responsible for each other because many use college as an excuse to not be responsible for yourself. We‚Äôre repeatedly taught about the dangers of alcohol and the importance of consent. My high school didn‚Äôt teach about consent or alcohol at all so unless parents do their jobs, many young men don‚Äôt learn about consent except from feminists on the internet and we all know how much men love listening to women. 

Now my fraternity has around 100 guys in it. Most of the great guys, the positive influences, hang out in similar circles so there have been more incidents of homophobia, sexism, and just general bad behavior. A year ago we had a recent brother rape a drunk girl after she asked him to take her home. He was immediately dropped from the fraternity (unanimously) but I could tell some of the brothers just wanted to save our fraternity‚Äôs name more than condemn the behavior. 

I believe fraternities are a great avenue to teach young men valuable lessons and they‚Äôre doing a better job in the past of doing so. Maybe my fraternity is better than most, but the rape incident from two years ago is the only incident like that we‚Äôve had in decades. 

Do you believe fraternities should be abolished, reformed, or left to progress how they will?",1
How do you think hetero couples should pay for birth control?,"For condoms, I think an equal split is very fair. Both people want to have sex, both people should pay equally.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think that a 50/50 split for other methods of birth control is financially is unfair toward women. 

&amp;#x200B;

They are the ones who have to put in time and effort to find a birth control they want, go to the doctor, fill perscriptions and so on. Not to mention, that it's their bodies that have to ""pay the price"" (this sounds very dramatic, I don't necessarily mean it that way, just can't think of a different way to phrase this). Taking the pill sometimes goes fine, sometimes it fracks up a persons body. IUDs and Implanons are invasive procedures. And it's not as if they volunteered to be the ones to have to think about birth control, the system is set up in such a way that it is impossible for them not to. 

&amp;#x200B;

The men I've discussed it with have said that the system totally sucks, but it's not their fault so why should they have to contribute more financially? They would not contribute more than 50% of the cost. The partners I've had this converstaion with mostly said they'd be fine just using condoms since it's a 50/50 split. I think condoms aren't as safe (pearl index) and so that's not enough, which was met with ""well it's the birth control you want so you pay for it"". This rubs me the wrong way, since I'm the one who has to bear the brunt of the consequences if birth control fails. One also said it's \*your\* birth control, so me contributing to it at all is nice, 50% is the only fair thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think those are kind of ""out of sight, out of mind"" attitudes, which really, really annoys me. It feels like men have the priviledge not to worry as much as women, as well as the priveledge of \*never\* having to do the heavy lifting on birth control - society absolves them of that responsibility automatically because there is no male birth control. So I think it's only fair men take on the one responsibility they actually can: Paying. (Assuming people actually have the cash in general)

[META] How do you manage the hard emotions around women's involvement in male dominated fields?,"I know we don't normally navigate 'personal dilemma' questions in this sub-- but I just got some absolutely devastating news from a friend and mentee about her situation in the union she recently completed a 5 year apprenticeship to join-- and with everything else going on in the world-- this news has put me into an extremely dark place.

I feel responsible for encouraging her (and many other women) into the trades; I feel like I totally failed to protect women in my social circle-- and underneath all that, I feel deeply hopeless about my ability to protect myself and other women in my community.

I feel like there are prices we pay, as marginalized people, to 'break into' male dominated organizations and industries, but speaking from personal experience-- I was never safe in those organizations and was in many situations where the institution itself provided no means for me to address sexual harassment or hostility-- and the only thing I could do was leave that industry.

"Writing compelling/""real"" female characters.","Disclaimer: English isn't my first language.

Hi.

I'm a male, mixed-race fantasy author who's 18 years old. In my stories, I write female characters too but I was looking at post in r/badwomensanatomy and r/menwritingwomen and I was wondering if men could even write compelling or realistic female characters from a feminist perspective.If yes, could you please link me things that could help me write a good female character?

Thanks in advance!

Edit:   
So, I think I'd like to get specific here and talk about my 2 female protagonists because I'm curious now.  

So the first female character I'd like to talk about is a 16 years old, half-elf doctor called Thea who works as a bodyguard for her best friend Ludwig. She's his bodyguard because he's the crown prince and while he isn't old enough to rule he wants to travel through his realm in secret to get to know his people. Even though she's 1 year younger than him she's calmer, more collected and more rational than him and is the voice of caution and reason in their relationship but she's extremely protective of him because he is the only person left that she loves (her mother was killed in the same night the emperor was killed), she never knew her father and never really had an extended family.   


The second would be a human mage called Carlatta. She's the director of the academy of mages that specializes in enchantment magic. First, I accidentally wrote her as the love interest of a male protagonist that dies so that he has a motivation but then I fell in love with her as a character and it dawned on me that this was just another ""Stuffed in the Fridge"" so I made her a main protagonist. She's a faux femme fatale that is a seductress that tries to seduce her former lover. Or so the reader is told. In reality, she's just a successful women coming from a patriarchal culture where people are intimitated by her success and spread rumors about her enchanting and seducing her way to power. 

Did I write something problematic or are these halfway ""good"" characters?",1

Whenever I have seen (pretty much solely) women try to criticise these assumptions, they would walk on eggshells, apologising all the way, insisting that they're adventurous otherwise, that it's all fine and okay and that they're not questioning anything that anyone is doing, but that they just have a few things that are rubbing them the wrong way.

And they're right. **If your argument is that any expression of sexuality is fine as long as it's consensual\*, how can you possibly talk about the inequality, neglect, unfair treatment, degradation, ignorance, damaging norms and objectification that women are put through in sex**, which only gets worse the more extreme the content gets (but is present even in ""vanilla"" sex)? **How is the insistence that sexual interests have no bearing on reality possibly compatible with acknowledging the very real damage these sexual interests do to women** both in how they're perceived in and outside sexual contexts, **and the existence of patriarchal pressures**? I would ask how these two value systems can coexist, but they don't seem to: women who point out the elephant in the room are discredited instantly by (usually) men who are always far more invested in normalising the patriarchal sexual norms that revolve around their needs and desires (with huge industries pandering almost exclusively to these ideas), than in women gaining equal treatment. How often have you seen men raise their voices in unison in defence of women who are hurt by these misogynistic ideas, vs in defence of misogynistic porn, kinks and fantasies, insisting on how harmless they are and how they're just simple ""fun"" (why ""fun"" for men is synonymous with misogyny is something you are not supposed to question) even to women talking about how badly it has affected their relationships and self-esteem as human beings? Moreover, doing extensive work on yourself in order to undo even an inkling of misogynistic ideas is not seen as a pre-requisite for engaging in supposedly completely unrelated-to-reality misogynistic sex and fantasies and doesn't even enter the picture in any sex community that I know of.

I realised this ties into my complaints of liberalism in general: treating misogyny as harmless fun, a manifestation of an infinite variety of human personalities (why these misogynistic personalities just so happen to skew heavily male is seen as a funny curiosity) and, the most popular, as offensive to women and their independence for implying that they'd be offended, affected and harmed by it. This is a common male strategy used to shut down feminist attempts to address and fix these issues. The idea is that we are somehow, contrary to all evidence, living in a society where everyone independently makes their own life decisions and ideas unaffected by centuries of patriarchal pressures still going strong, so by criticising these views, you are criticising an integral part of their identity and free will, and women's choice and preference towards misogynistic unfair treatment. **If you think it is possible for feminists to function in these environments without having to engage in copious amounts of doublethink or keep their heads down, please try to explain how, because I am truly curious.** The only thing I have seen on this subject is denial that these things happen and, if they do, denial that they are a problem.

\---------

\*I personally don't see how misogyny is rendered acceptable just by the act of masturbating to it, or women consenting to it much like they have for centuries. Accepting patriarchal gender norms is not daring, progressive or new in any way and never has been. I have never seen these fabled men whose misogyny is solely and exclusively limited to masturbating despite repeated claims from men that *everyone* knows the difference between reality and fiction (which is also not in line with the experiences of a hefty chunk of women). I am also at a loss of why we're acting like misogyny is some inconceivable crazy part of someone's unique imagination that by some sheer coincidence happens to manifest en masse in the same ways throughout centuries, rather than very obviously directly based in widespread ideas about men and women and their values.",1

Men afraid of women at work,"There is evidence of a growing number of men, who avoid women in the workplace, avoid being one on one, avoid mentoring women. This hurts women.¬†


https://nypost.com/2019/05/17/men-are-afraid-to-mentor-women-after-metoo-and-it-hurts-us-all-study/


I read a number of articles on that topic. Another example:


https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2019/02/18/in-the-era-of-metoo-are-men-scared-of-mentoring-women/


There is a common pattern. Authors ignore and dismiss concerns of men, they give their own explanations of the experiences, feelings and motives of these men, in condescending and scolding manner and shift the topic to empowering women, defeating bias against women and improving career opportunities for women. So basically men should shut up, stop whining and do their best to help women advance.¬†I'd say, it is basically womansplaining. 


I know, that feminism is about women's issues, not about troubles of men. That's fair enough, I totally accept this approach. So let's assume these papers are supposed to fix the problem for women, defeat the backlash against metoo. However, let's see what kind of message does it deliver to these men, who are afraid of women at the workplace?¬†


Men aren't listened to. Their concerns and point of view are ignored. Men aren't entitled to be treated with dignity and feeling of security. Men are an instrument for the advance of¬† women...¬†


So if a man is afraid of women, he receives a message that his fears are completely valid.

So. How would you approach that problem (men silently ignoring women, because they are afraid)?

Is my frustration with white activists bigoted?,"Hi, I'm a BIPOC Non-binary feminist who is very active on feminist, social justice and lgbt+ spaces, usually lurking and listening.

Over this year especially, I've grown very frustrated with white feminists, lgbt and leftist spaces, usually due to overt euro-centric, white fragility, and subtle racism and ableism. 

The thing is, my frustration is usually aimed at women/femmes, and I'm not sure if I'm getting misogynistic. 

I guess my reasoning for targeting women/femmes is because I have a higher expectation for women/femmes. 

I kinda already have a low expectation for cis men, because I see men display bigotry more then women, *(apologises for the generalisation)* so I get angry when I see women display bigotry. 


Is my frustration bigoted?

Why is there so little medical support for women during their periods?,"I was thinking recently about an experience I had when I was a teenage girl. I went to my (male) doctor because I had passed out during my period. I was in the shower and a bunch of black spots crept into my vision and then I fully blacked out. It was only for a little bit, but still.

I told my doctor about the incident, and he first asked me if I was anorexic. I said no. Then he essentially gave no advice, and said that this was ""normal"" for teenage girls.

I look back and I just can't help but think that the lack of support for women during their periods is an issue of systemic sexism. Even if it *is* normal, is it not unhealthy to be passing out because of blood loss? Should there not be some kind of procedure? The only option is usually birth control (though he didn't recommend that to me) which generally has a ton of side effects.

It just feels so dismissive and like nobody has put in the effort to research because the issue is women-specific. ",1

"Nurture, nature and culture ‚Äî all the same?","1. I was reading a blog recently, that told a story about how Amazon sells sex dolls resembling children. Gross, but they also said how Japanese scientists believe these sex dolls actually might help children since they keep predators from preying on actual children. Here is the [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/01/can-child-dolls-keep-pedophiles-from-offending/423324/) I found.  
German scientists, on the other hand, believe it has the opposite effects, and may actually encourage pedophiles to move to children from dolls. Here is [an article](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-government-signs-off-on-tougher-child-sex-abuse-rules/a-55347906) that mentions that they passed a law to crack down on dolls resembling children.   
People in the comments were arguing who is right, but I was thinking ‚Äî¬†can they both be right (or wrong)? I mean, Japanese and German culture as so extremely different, that can we really have universal conclusions about such complex parts of human behavior? In fact, can we really take seriously any research about any gender differences for example, when it cannot be divorced from the culture? 
2. Epigenetic inheritance. Several years ago I read about new studies about [trauma passed down to generations](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190326-what-is-epigenetics). Basically, traits a person acquired during their life can be passed down to offsprings. This is a very complicated and not very well researched topic, but some evidence does in fact suggest there is such thing. You can read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenerational_epigenetic_inheritance) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism). 

Ok finally to my question. There are a lot of questions here about nature and nurture (most are in bad faith). A lot of misogynistic figures like Jordan Peterson use these studies that supposedly show how gender differences are genetic. I mean, there are a lot of studies that prove the ""nature"" but there are also a lot of studies that prove ""nurture"", and the more I read about it, the more it resembles the wave-particle duality. But it can't be both?

Or can it? 

If nature IS nurture due to epigenetic inheritance, won't it be the final solution to all these arguments? In simple terms, we no longer might need to argue that ""no, women aren't biologically inclined to accept lower salaries"" but we can link it to generation of oppression and culture of patriarchy that indeed makes women more agreeable. It's nature ‚Äî because it's in DNA, but it's also nurture ‚Äî because it came as a result of patriarchy. 

Scientists have already proven that people's brains are plastic. British taxi drivers have different brain chemistry because they needed to memorize hundreds of streets. So why cannot human genetic be plastic? 

And back to my first point, we cannot deny that nations and ethnicities have different behavior patterns. I know this argument is often used by racists, and believe me it's honestly not my intention. Racists talk about ""genetically"" ~~worse~~ different ethnicities, while scientists argue that it's due to culture and euro-centric standards. But maybe they are indeed different, maybe culture is genetics, and both are constantly changing. Maybe Japanese pedophiles are in fact inclined to hurt children less if exposed to sex dolls, and German pedophiles are the opposite?",1

What Do You Think About Showgirls (1995)?,"After its 25th anniversary just a bit ago, I found myself wondering what other feminists thought of this movie.

I still believe that it is a Nature vs Nurture issue, and I tend to take more of the nurture side however I can‚Äôt deny certain biological facts.

I had a question about the nature aspect of this argument. Besides just hormones do genes play a role in this?

I also believe that sometimes people get lucky and if they show up and deliver, then power to them for making the most of their luck and opportunities. I don't think we should put others down for this attitude towards life.  


With all of that said, and all that she has actually accomplished at only 48, my initial reaction was that despite her maybe controversial political alignment, I thought feminists and republican women might come together to see her as a feminist icon as she is a woman who seems to truly have it all and has broken the glass ceiling.

Vasectomy and body autonomy,"Throwaway account, I prefer to keep this question separated from my main account. SorryAlso  for my english, its my second language.

My understanding is that contraception is important part of body autonomy. And women has no obligation to disclose its use, if she would be punished or suffer for  it. She has no obligation to tell about hormonal pills to conservative/religious parents or partner. Women also has no obligation to disclose morning-after pill, failed pregnancies or abortion. At extreme end, women there is no obligation to tell father about new  born baby (if he is abusive etc)... 

My question: how does this body autonomy translates to men and their use  of contraception? Do men have obligation to disclose its use if they would be punished for using it? 

More specifically do I have obligation to disclose my vasectomy in relationship, if we also use condoms as anti-conception? 

In past I was abused and physically attacked for disclosure. It took me a few months to recover. I refuse to go through it again.

When Carnival is near (or already happening), the government makes a lot of anti-harassment publicity like ""no means no"", ""a costume is not an invite"", ""catcalling is not a compliment"", and anti-harassment statements along those lines.

While I think there's nothing wrong with that initiative (it's great, but sadly necessary),  
the existence of those anti-harassment propaganda makes me wonder:

Does it really makes men harass women less?

I mean, I'm totally against all those harassment experiences women go through at Carnival   
(groping, catcalling, forced kisses, or even rape itself), but does this anti-harassment propaganda stops sexual offenders from sexual-offending? Sexual offenders won't look at those campaigns and feeling compelled to not harassing women, right?

Should powerful countries use their influence to make the world more feminist?,"Question in title, but to clarify, here's an example.

Country A has established complete gender equality (I know this seems farfetched) and has a neighboring country B who is behind the times. Country B doesn't give women the right to vote, have abortions, or equal wages. Would feminists support non violent action taken by country A to exert pressure on country B such as an embargos? Also, would they support using force, such as directly engaging in wars or supporting opposition groups within country B? The goal of such actions would be for country B to pass legislation which gives women greater equality.

Just to be clear, this has nothing to do with any real life scenario. I am just curious if feminists agree with this sort of thing. Also, my own opinion is a point (severe human rights abuses, genocide, etc.) where country A would have a moral obligation to act. However, I'm not sure at what exact point that would be as I am against wars in general or interfering in the affairs of other countries.

Women's Perspectives on Sexual Assault in the Past?,"So recently, I was having this debate with a guy who tried to claim that women are now ""just suddenly"" having this problem with sexual assault. My argument was that the majority of women always wanted consent, they were just never listened to by the men who made the rules throughout history.
 
But I got to thinking, because history is so andocentric, I really don't know anything about those women. The only thing I know about rape in the past is based on  a male perspective. For instance, many historic rape laws only treated rape as a property crime, where it was only considered wrong if the woman ""belonged"" to a man. I would like to see the women's perspectives on rape and assault, especially acts that were not taboo at the time, for instance, marital rape.

Someone scoffed at this sentiment recently, saying ""Women will screw it up too. Power corrupts. People in power are always awful."" 

And this is an argument I want to counter. 

From my research, it would seem companies with more women in C-suite roles show a profit advantage, as well as better working conditions. So, it's better for the economy. But then I know the retort will be, so what? The economy drives wealth division. 

Well, since 5% of all CEOs of Fortune 500s are female and that's PATHETIC, encouraging female leadership will bring about equality. Which I see as a good thing. But why? Why does it MATTER? How do you make someone care? 

I read today that women graduate from college with expectations of promotions and raises that are DASHED by real life working conditions. Meanwhile, men have the same expectations throughout. And are promoted and raised much higher. Um, depressing. 

It's not fair. And really, that's the best reason I can come up with. But when is life ever fair?

Thankfully, I have seen an improvement in some of these areas (particularly from young people and online activism) but I do agree that there is less discourse about these issues in many feminist spaces.

For example, this is similar to saying BLM, why not All Live Matter. The fact that this group came about was because said group are being treated wrongfully and unfairly.

From my understanding, Feminism focuses on the equality of women's rights in tandem with men's rights. 

However, similar to groups such as BLM, it feels difficult to join the movement if an individual is not under the issues felt by the members of the movement. Sadly it feels as groups such as these, perhaps not by intention feel quite insular. At least through my perspective as a male.

I've often come across religious people making casual statements like ""a wife's duty is to follow her husband"", ""if my husband allows I might"", ""there are things that only men can do"", etc etc. Most of these things are backed up by their own religious beliefs, while I am not religious, I respect that faith plays a strong role in people's lives, however it's so hard for me to grasp how such views sit well with the people who have them? How can you even explain Feminist struggles to someone who inherently believes that there is a designated ""place"" for men and women in life and society?",1
"What does it mean to be an ""ally"" when it comes to feminism?","Traditionally, I understand the word ""ally"" to mean ""one who advocates for a marginalized group while not belonging to it."" However, in the context of feminism, this seems redundant, since men can and do identify as ""feminist"" (I mean, obviously not enough of them, but you know what I mean).

Does the word ""ally"" mean something different in this context? Charitably, I could see it being used to imply that you don't want to speak over women; uncharitably, I could see it being used to shrug off the responsibility of actually advocating for feminism. Is there any consistency to how the term is used when it comes to women's rights?",1

Why do analyses of the gender wage gap never control for height?,"The research seems pretty conclusive that height significantly impacts earnings. Doing some quick estimation in my head from the data in https://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i582 it seems that height alone would predict women being paid 5% less (curiously about the size of the ‚Äúunexplained wage gap‚Äù). Even so, I can‚Äôt find any analyses of height‚Äôs impact on the gender pay gap, isn‚Äôt this worth looking into?",1
"Is anyone aware of any research that looks at things like the pay gap, domestic violence, sexual violence etc while controlling for gender expression and not just gender?","Hey everyone,

I don‚Äôt know if this is a stupid question so feel free to tell me if I‚Äôm completely of base with this. 
So I was wondering if anyone was aware of any research that looked at inequality in relation gender expression. 

Just  to give an example, I am aware of the gender pay gap . However, research on the gender pay gap within LGBTQ+ populations is more complicated. For example, the pay gap between gay men and lesbians is much lower in many places , with several  studies showing gay men earning  *less than* straight men and lesbians earning *more than* straight women. Overall, though these studies show a smaller  gap, they still  show that gay men earn more. However, I fee that this may become more complicated if controlling for gender expression. 
For example, some studies on gay men have shown that single gay men earn significant more than coupled gay men,  concluding that being visibly gay severely diminishes earning potential in some places. There are also some studies showing that  gay men read as masculine are much more economically successful. As such, I‚Äôm wondering if a lot of the privilege in this area is tied to gender expression. While I haven‚Äôt been able to find anything, I‚Äôd be curious to know whether gay men read as feminine earn more than say lesbians read as masculine.

Another example is domestic violence. While LGBTQ research is very limited in this area, there does seem to be some evidence that such violence is more common in lesbian relationships. While this has been questioned on the basis of lesbians perhaps being more likely to report such violence, I can‚Äôt help but wonder whether gender expression may come into play, with feminine presenting  gay men perhaps being less violent  than masculine lesbians. 


Anyway, it‚Äôs a long shot but if anyone is aware of anything that explores this stuff in relation to gender expression rather than sexed bodies, I‚Äôd love to hear about it. Perhaps there is some stuff that has been written about women embodying toxic masculinity?


Edit: I was a bit reluctant to question domestic violence but i did so because of some lesbian terfs that I have encountered reducing such violence to to an issue with people AMAB. I feel that any evidence of the issue being tied to embodiments of toxic masculinity could be useful for deconstructing such assumptions",1
The non-inclusion of male rape victims in the Indian Penal Code,"Looking for some Indian feminists here! Of course, others are also welcome.

The Indian Penal Code, Section 375, defines rape as: "" Rape.‚ÄîA man is said to commit ‚Äúrape‚Äù who, except in the case hereinafter excepted, has sexual intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under any of the six following de¬≠scriptions: "" followed by descriptions of consent, consent under duress etc.

This clearly means there is no legislation for a man to file a rape complaint if he's been raped (either by men or women). A glaring inequality, obviously.

My question is, are there any feminists fighting for this? I genuinely have not seen any feminist organizations raising their voice to fix this. I started a petition which is still very nascent. I also saw men's rights organizations trying to bring light to this, but were vilified by media outlets such as Vice ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKSqmwDzFxA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKSqmwDzFxA)).

I'm not trying to taunt anyone; if I see any proof of feminists fighting for this, I'd be delighted beyond words to know that the fight does not have to be divided between feminists and non-feminists.

Progressive cultures and everyday sexism,"Hey I aim this question towards those mostly who had the opportunity to visit many different countries:  


When it comes to ""casual sexism"" (such as not listening to women, objectification, commenting on appearances, or shaming unfeminine behavior), do you noticed any substantial difference in men between different countries? How does that relate to how liberal or progressive that countries is considered?   


My question comes from a conversation with one of my girlfriends who after living in the US spent 1 year in the EU. She said that man were MUCH MORE sexist in the western countries, that are considered much more progressive then the USA. (France and Germany to be exact.) So much so, that she couldnt even wear a skirt, because of the staring and comments on the street. Then she spent more time in other parts in the EU more to the east (i cant really remember which countries, but small ones), that are considered very traditionalist countries. There men were much more reserved didnt harass her, but also kind of just looked trough her, like she wasnt even there.  
Im deeply surprised by this, as I always thought of western EU to be much more equal and respectful when it comes to women. Had anyone else had similar experiences?",1
Are people who own art created by problematic creators obligated to get rid of that art or add some notice when that art is presented?,"I was thinking specifically about art that I own from a game called Magic the Gathering (MtG) but I'll start with a specific example of a more well known artist first.

TW: sexual abuse

\-- Specific question with a more well known artist --

If you own music by R. Kelly should you stop listening to it or whenever you hear/play it, do something to acknowledge his history of sexual abuse? Especially if you already own the art, what is the 'correct' thing to do? Does it matter that while a particular song can't be replaced, you can just listen to other music? What if you do like a particular R. Kelly song? Should you find a way to get it without potentially benefiting him, or just not seek out his art?

\-- Specific to me version --

MtG is a trading card game where players battle with decks of cards they choose out of their collection. An essential part of every deck is the 'lands' which are a key part of gameplay. Each land has art on it, and at this point, there are hundreds of different versions for the 5 most common lands. Lands can be acquired by purchasing individual cards from a store, but are most frequently acquired by opening randomized packs of cards.

One of the more prolific artists for MtG, Noah Bradley, admitted on twitter (and then deleted) to sexually abusive behavior. Some cards only have one version for which he is the artist. For other cards, like lands, he is one artist of many. 

Before Bradley's admission, I would frequently seek out lands with his art because, in my opinion, they look really good, but I've already decided that I won't do that anymore.

Now what should I do with these lands featuring Bradley's art? Should I keep them and play with them while acknowledging (either to just to myself or aloud to my opponent as well) that he's a terrible person? Should I throw them away or trade or sell them away? Or something else that I haven't thought of?

confusion with misogyny and body positivity in art,"Hi Ask Feminist, 

I'm an artist, and I have a question regarding art, misogyny, and body positivity. 

I apologize for any mistakes in the post because of my writing skills

here is the background i'm from a third world country, I grew up in a woman-dominated society, I grew up knowing that respecting woman is by having good manners as individual and help to create an equal rights system which is, in reality, is not only, I became an activist, unfortunately, I was drawing what I have seen in the book, magazines pictures of models, etc without any understood of misogyny, thinking its form of appreciation to draw women in this manner. when I moved out of my country for college, I tried to fit with men western society, which was a big mistake as a young individual because it Terribly influenced my art and thanks to my girlfriend who showed me the level of inequality, sexism in the western country which is unfortunate. as the rest of the world.

I have bought the sketchbook of an artist called Frank Frazetta, to use as a reference, the book showed beautiful drawings of women and men of all ages and sizes in a beautiful realistic sketch which is good to me, since I'm trying to make a video about art and body positivity, and how SJW failed to help society learn to understand desexualizing bodies in a very awful way, I have decided to get another book by the same artist and the book called  Sensuous Frazetta and I was in doubt if the art and pictures of sketches are sexist and misogynistic from a feminist critique, 

I highly appreciate art,  I'm a different person now and  I don't want to be toxic, sexist, or a bad influence on my audience, nor my children in the future.",1
What does femininity means to you?,"Edit: by femininity in the title I meant the word ""womanhood""

I guess this is not quite the usual question you might see on here, but I'll carry on and if this isn't aligned with this sub's rules I'll delete it.

I'm a pre transitioned, mostly closeted trans woman (or girl, I'm barely 17 even lol) I'm out to my close friends, and *some* of them have even started referring to me by female pronouns, but I'm conflicted.

I find it hard to believe the fact that even though they've known me for months as male, now just after telling them ""hey I've been questioning for a long while and I think I'm a girl"" that they suddenly full heartedly see me as a girl, most of my friends are cis girls (aside from one trans man) (or boy???) And it's hard for me to understand how someone who was born a girl, has been a girl all of her life, and has such a grasp of their femininity and womanhood suddenly considering me (a 6'1 dude with the body, voice and socialisation of a man) ""one of their own""? I feel like they see me as someone who does larp and they just say I'm a real girl in a dishonest way, either to avoid hurting their own self perception of how accepting/woke they are, or to avoid hurting my feelings and popping my bubble.

I don't know why, but I think I view femininity as this sacred status, something like Judaism were the circumstances have to be specific. You can say you're Jewish, you can read the tanach even in Hebrew and do mitzvot and even wear their clothings, but if you were born a goy, you are simply not Jewish. And because I didn't get to experience life as a girl, I can't be a girl, and I can't actually relate to my cis female friends until after I pass (which won't be for a while because my mom isn't exactly keen on accepting me), I feel like a fake, like a ridiculous larper that is making everyone in the room and outside it uncomfortable and full of pity towards me.",1

Should a Women ask for consent for a warmup,"Inspired by a CMV post I read early I have a question about consent.

Consider the following scenario: After 3 dates the woman invites the man into her place. Sexual and emotional attraction is there and they hit if of with it hot make out session. The woman stops the man from going any further (as is her right and totally OK). But the man is frustrated.

The woman only wanted the make out session and did not want sex. She got everything she wanted out of the date. The man thought the make out session was foreplay and would not have consented to it if he know that it was nothing else.

The woman sexually exploited the man for her needs. Should the woman not address that she does not want sex now but would be down for some action?

Edit: There seem to be some confusion, that I may imply that the woman owns sex. This is wrong. My scenario is specifically for the situations in which the woman knows that she does not want sex and if she should tell him beforehand.",1
The Struggle,"I believe women should be given an equal place in society to the pedestal men have been placed on. But it's hard not to feel down when I see things that seem to make women somehow intrinsically better than men. Like science itself is showing them to be better in pretty much every way. A few examples include how each of women's senses outperform those of men, women play a much larger role in reproduction, women tend to outperform men in all sorts of academic measures, women generally live longer than men, there are far fewer women who do crimes (that we can see anyway), the female body repairs itself better by having a second X chromosome, women have more beautiful voices (okay, this is more my personal experience of how people seem to enjoy music with singing more when a woman's voice is involved, but I don't often see much evidence to the contrary), women tend to be the preferred subject for every kind of visual art (statues, paintings, etcetera, but this applies more to modern day), and how nearly every person people are scared of is a man, not a woman. I could go further, but I'll stop there, for now at least. Whenever a guy says anything like this, at best he gets answers that are like a pat on the back, expressing a rhetoric that they like men and that's why they want them to stay around, but this isn't helpful. How in the world is it possible for me to feel equal to a woman knowing no matter what I do, she's better? It's not. When so many basic things seem to be in favor of women, maleness sometimes almost feels like some sort of genetic defect (this might be a bit extreme). The only end to this struggle is solid evidence. Can you find any evidence that disputes these ideas? Sorry this was so long, maybe just try a couple of them and see what you find.",1

What's your take on alimony when both partners are earning well?,"Alimony was originally introduced to compensate the non-working spouse as they sacrificed their career to raise their kids. But if both parties have a job, why should the higher-earning party pay alimony? It just doesn't make sense. It's not like the lower-earning spouse sacrificed their career for their family. They have a full-time job. For instance, it makes no sense for a guy earning $150k to pay alimony to his ex-wife who earns 100k in a full-time job. I'm quoting these numbers because a friend of mine, who earned $150k had to pay his ex-wife alimony, even though she didn't sacrifice her career for the family.

I usually conceptualize this as a normal distribution with on the y-axis the amount of people and on the x-axis the benefit they received from being part of that group.

My female friend is misogynistic toward other women. How do I address this?,"This rant pertains to someone I know, who‚Äôs been getting on my nerves lately:

I have a friend who tends to be relatively toxic to other females. For example, if we‚Äôre playing video games, and there‚Äôs a girl on the other team, her goal is to instantly assert herself as ‚Äúthe better gamer girl‚Äù and find irrational (and sometimes sexist) ways to talk down the other female, sometimes even slut shaming cause that girl allegedly ‚Äúsounded like a w***e.‚Äù 

Myself, and even her boyfriend try to explain that what she‚Äôs doing isn‚Äôt nice at all, and she gets mad at us for taking a stranger‚Äôs side. It‚Äôs one thing for usual gamer banter and trash talk, but she‚Äôs genuinely ruined people‚Äôs days, because she preemtively assumes that that girl is ‚Äúa b***h‚Äù and bullies them. Some girls will fight back, and some will be sad, but regardless, she aggravated them in the first place and they could‚Äôve been completely chill before she came along.

At the end of it all, SHE gets stressed and claims that these girls online were mean or even misogynistic... TOWARDS HER... and that by defending themselves they were being a**holes.‚Äù If we call her out she says we don‚Äôt understand ‚Äúbecause we‚Äôre guys.‚Äù

My 2 questions are, is there a reason for girls who adopt this attitude?

Just confused at why am i even a feminist anymore. How is exactly feminism about equality? Need help from fellow feminists,"This post is NOT in anyway to degrade feminism. I consider myself a feminist(although i am not even sure now what it means with all these different definitions out there). **I JUST WANT TO RE AFFIRM WHY AM I A FEMINIST.** As far as i have heard , its about equality. But wherever i search the definition it, it means it is about the equality FOR WOMEN. We already have equal rights infact we have more rights than men.   
I want to believe in the movement but i just dont get it. Maybe i am missing something but every time i try to explain how women are oppressed i just feel ... stupid? I don't feel the force behind my words.

Most deaths are of men, most suicides are of men, most hard jobs in the world are done by men, and men already receive much less help than us women in most cases. Albeit its mostly men doing it to each other but does that also not mean that we are privilaged and not the primary victims? 

Men might be doing it to each other but that only means they are the real victims and not us. They are in much more pain than us. They need more help not us. We already have the rights we need in America. We have infact MORE rights than men. 

I think that feminism works on patriarchy to dismantle it but how do we know that whatever will replace it will be better? Women leaders have been known to start more wars then men in past. I mean we are not saints either compared to men.

Also isnt patriarchy sort of justified? It has been men who have done most(not all) of the things in society. They are the ones who mostly built it. They are the ones who do most of the hard jobs. Isnt patriarchy justified in a sense? Why are we dismantling it instead of fixing it?

I feel like men need far more help than women in current times. They are the ones who are much more fucked up. How am i wrong? Please help me. Please help me realize what am i even fighting for.

"Are there any resources (books, interviews, lectures, etc) that analyze hentai and western animated pornography from a radical feminist perspective?","There‚Äôs plenty to be found about live action pornography, but I‚Äôm trying to find resources for animated pornography. I‚Äôm looking for ethical, moral, feminist, sociological etc analysis of it. 

Recently I‚Äôve been wondering if all pornography in modern form is exploitative and objectifying as well as where and when erotica or artistic nudity crosses the line into pornography. My gut assumption is that it happens when the viewer becomes aroused and acts on arousal through masturbation. 

I‚Äôve been wondering if all pornography in society right now where the industry is so perverse and unrestricted is objectifying and harmful to women. Many women, myself included, can have periods in life where we feel that when a partner watches porn, even if animated, that it can be hurtful and harmful to the relationship. Not all women of course, but it‚Äôs common to see. It‚Äôs harder as we age as well while men our age continue the cookie cutter young girl porn. Or use it because it feels better when they come. Or when we aren‚Äôt in the mood and they want variety. 

We get many arguments about why porn in various forms is okay and why men are justified in using it. It‚Äôs hard to find arguments from the other side, especially for non-live action media. I‚Äôm kinda grappling with how I feel about it and trying to analyze the situation as a whole in comparison to my internal reaction to it. 

Personally, I just feel hopeless sometimes as a h√©tero woman that we have to deal with so many men who have been watching porn daily since they were 13 and get defensive of any critique of it. Growing numbers have porn induced erectile function or escalation into damaging content and sometimes content that borders on illegal, especially where animated is concerned. 

We get the ‚Äútestosterone-Rex‚Äù argument that men are visual and thats why they need it, even though men who have left porn behind speak out against this excuse. Even some biology and medical research is trying to crush this assumption that men are just visual and women are imaginative. So many men and women now conflate masturbation with pornography even though the *can* be mutually exclusive. People say they aren‚Äôt dependent on it and use it in moderation yet they can‚Äôt masturbate and orgasm without any pornographic reinforcement. 

The high speed internet pornography today feels very damaging in various areas (mental, societal, legal, relationships, etc). I just want help analyzing it from a feminist perspective and trying to put into words how I might be feeling, whether it‚Äôs justified or I‚Äôm being irrational. I‚Äôm pretty much set on the harms of live action porn and those industries today. What I‚Äôm undecided about is animated pornography, especially hentai since it‚Äôs a popular form today. Anyone have recommendations or experience with this?",1
I still pay 100% of the bill,"In a recent coffee date I insisted upon paying 100% of the bill, I thought nothing of it at the time, but my girlfriend was saying that it‚Äôs a gross demonstration of how I treated her with inequality in smaller ways. I thought upon it and she‚Äôs right, or at least in my mind she‚Äôs right, should I proceed insisting on paying the majority, but not all of it or should I split it equally with her? I‚Äôm sort of at ends with the problem, any advice on how to avoid this kind of subliminal inequality in the future or just if I was being a bad human being would be helpful?",1
Going through boyfriends phone and browsing history for self protection - is that a thing?,"Hi,

Dude here. I recently was part of a conversation that steered to the topic of privacy vs. security, and the necessary tradeoffs between those two.

One of the women, who I know as probably being pretty far on the political left, mention she goes through the phone and browser history of her (relatively new) boyfriend. Some of the women present admitted to doing the same, some didnt. I quickly criticized her for basically disregarding her partners privacy, which is where things took a (for me) unexpected turn: She and two of the other women who agreed said this is a matter of protecting themselves. I ll try to summarize their points briefly:

1.) Phone to know if he is taking nonconsensual images or secretly dating/seeing other women, or might even be involved in something like selling drugs or crime

2.) phone to know if he has problematic connections or contacts, like those infamous WhatsApp groups with racist or far right content that sometimes get mentioned in the press.

3.) browser history to know his porn habits, to know if he is into problematic and potentially dangerous stuff or has fetishes

4.) browser history to know whether he is being radicalized by various MRA movements, secretly part of the incel sphere or otherwise being influenced. This latter point was also something one person claimed would basically have to be monitored continuosly. She cited her sisters experience with such a case, where her husband of 3 years went down the rabbit hole of the Jordan Petersen craze, and it became a major problem.

Now, I ll admit my first reaction was to think these women are just trying to rationalize their jealousy and controlling behaviour, or are obsessed (maybe from past experiences) with sniffing out secrets. But given that these women are all mid 20s to late 30s, college educated and generally not, to my knowledge, lacking in life experience, thats probably not the right conclusion. Are these reasons, from a feminist perspective, a valid justification for this breach of privacy?",1
Why does feminism reject the MRA movement,"My question is why Feminism does not accept and why it does not accept the MRA movement.

How do you feel about being asked to represent the feminist perspective in everyday life?,"I had a situation recently where I was asked to participate in a discussion on a specific subject that I have a lot of knowledge about. This was on Zoom. There were three men, and me, the one woman. The topic itself is not directly about women's issues or feminism, but we got to talking about a person who is well-respected in the industry but also highly problematic and who has many allegations of sexual assault against him.

I had some things to say about that, as did the other participants. It was a good discussion and no one said anything out of place or anti-feminist. But one guy on the call kept privately messaging me in the zoom chat and telling me I should be pushing back more and that ""we really need to hear the feminist perspective about this"". I'd say I was talking a decent amount, and that he was the only one talking more than me. He sent several messages sort of checking in on me and telling me that I should feel free to speak up more. At the end of the call he said I shouldn't apologize for talking over someone. There were a few instances during the call where I talked at the same time as someone and said ""Oh, sorry..."" or something along those lines.

I think he meant well and I don't want to split hairs about men trying to be good feminists or good allies, but it bothered me. It actually made me more self conscious and singled out. Like as the only woman I was the ultimate authority on the feminist perspective. What do you all think about this?",1
Is lesbianism related to patriarchy,"Hello there, 

As an anti-feminist I would like to apologise in advance, if any of the following statements seem tone-deaf or incomprehensible.

Straight man and lesbians are gynophilic, which makes them engage in negative behaviour like: Objectifying women, consuming pornorgraphy, laying with female sex-workers, gazing and sexually harassing women and alike. There is also a high degree of domestic abuse, which can be found in lesbian relationships. 

So, I was wondering: is lesbianism an extension of or in any way related to patriarchy?",1

Can Someone Speak to the Relationship Between Feminism and Psychoanalysis?,"I'm particularly interested in its connections to postmodern feminism.

I'm currently taking a class on psychoanalysis and my professor recommended me *Psychoanalysis and Feminism* by Mitchell but that that was the extent of his knowledge on any connection. I definitely plan to read that book, but I'm wondering if there's any other texts or figures I should know and if there's room for a ""psychoanalytic feminism""?

I have absolutely no idea what the partiarchy is,"So im a boy, 15 years old and i have no idea what the partiarchy is still. When i was younger (about 12-13) i watched stuff like Sargon and all that but now i have jumped far left. But seeing all those feminist wrecked compilations and stuff, i have nothing else to associate with the word ""partiarchy"" other than laughing out loud. I feel really bad for doing it, and i try to hide it by covering my mouth. There's a girl in my RME class who is definitely a feminist, but we are not friends anymore and i am not that confident. Anyway, she mentions the patriarchy in class and i let out a small chuckle. I covered my mouth and i feel really bad as i agree already with most of what she is saying. But i realised i actually have no idea what the patriarchy is, is it an institution, or some sort of bias held in society? is it like a generic term to describe misogyny in society? i have no idea and i am glad i found this. Are there also any examples of it, or some videos i could watch to look into it a bit more?",1
Talking to a TERF as a cis man,"(X-posted from /r/socialjustice101)

A friend of mine recently admitted to me that trans women offend her, e.g. she thinks that they caricature women and ""appropriate"" her gender and experiences with sexism.

While I'm pretty confident that she's wrong to be offended, it didn't feel like it was my place to say that. In most other situations it would be frowned upon for a man to dismiss a woman's concerns when it comes to gender issues, so I felt uncomfortable saying ""no, as a cis man I can tell you that you, a cis woman, are wrong to be offended.""

Am I just being silly?",1

Best Clothing Companies That Donate To Feminist Organizations &amp; NonProfits,"Hello! Just found this forum and haven't yet checked out the typical discussions-- so I hope this question is appropriate for this forum. 

Anyways, my sister-in law's birthday is in early November and wanted to get her and myself a  shirt promoting feminism. I noticed that she, like me, have a lot of political clothing but could use some more feminist or women rights articles of clothing in our wardrobe. ""Feminist Apparel"" was of course the first suggestion in a quick google search; however, from little research I read the CEO Alan Martofel laid of 90% of workers for, ""not supporting his views,"" but multiple sources say this wasn't true, and that it was more because of the workers finding out about immoral capital driven beliefs and history of being a serial sexual abuser of women--subsequently, calling for his resignation, only for him to shortly step down and fire his current staff.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I mentioned, my research is limited and i'm not sure the current state or action of the company, but would just rather avoid it all together. So my question is, what are some alternatives for feminist clothing, that also donate profits to coalition of feminist nonprofits or just fight for the cause in general? A few options would be appreciated, since this is a gift and something I hope we can wear for style and message. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand you can't trust major companies in a capitalism driven industry, but just looking for any advice on morally upstanding, or websites that are truthful in their donations. Again, sorry if this isn't on point with this forums typical post, but regardless i'm glad to be apart of it now! Thanks in advance!",1

"Do you think it's ""playing into the patriarchy"" or otherwise problematic when a woman wants to be physically attractive?","I notice a trend in female-majority communities/subs where whenever a woman talks about being unattractive and says that she wants to be attractive, a very common response is ""wanting to be pretty is just playing into the patriarchy.""

For instance, [here's a thread](https://www.removeddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/i3k30t/how_to_make_peace_with_being_ugly/) from a woman who wants advice on coping with being unattractive, and one of the deleted comments said this:

&gt; Why is beauty women‚Äôs ultimate goal? Why do we try to attain looking like a model while being brilliant, responsible and kind. Men don‚Äôt have that kind of pressure. It‚Äôs bullshit we internalize that.

&gt; You need to realize beauty shouldn‚Äôt be the goal and let go of the chains of patriarchy. Read radical feminist literature. It‚Äôll make you realize wanting to feel beautiful is just a trap made by men so women don‚Äôt focus on their awesomeness and pay too much money and attention to something incredibly superficial.

&gt; Look at how many successful men are ugly as sin. Do you think they really care? No. They‚Äôre too busy working and thinking and making their dreams happen. Channel your inner man who‚Äôs never felt pressure to be pretty.

You can also find related comments [on another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/ia7lor/i_wish_it_were_socially_acceptable_to_admit_that/):

So generally, I see a difference between valuing looks as your only asset, and merely wanting to be more physically attractive. I think this kind of response (above) is just sidelining the issue and suggesting that it's problematic for a woman to desire to be physically attractive. If I were to give advice to unattractive women in such a position (like myself, honestly :/), I wouldn't tell them ""no, you shouldn't want to be pretty, that's the patriarchy controlling you"" but I would rather give them advice on how to improve their appearance where possible. What advice would you give such a woman?

So what do you think of this approach?",1
Why isn't there more support for a new English word for a male person?,"Hear me out: my wife just said ""ombudsperson"" and I laughed involuntarily. More absurdly, there are constructions like ""sportspersonship"" (not a real word, yet, I know)  
Please note, I like the term ""chairperson,"" and I rant about the economic value of domestic labor, so I'm not hostile to feminist ideals. I think this question is fairly radical.

Proto-Indo-European had two declensions/genders, animate and inanimate.  Then there developed an explicitly feminine declension/gender, and so  the animate declension adopted masculinity by default. 

Why not keep going? Keep ""man"" meaning ""human"" but come up with a new word for ""man"" meaning ""male human."" Surely someone has made some suggestions, right?

I have a question regarding online advice.,"
Originally posted in r/BlatantMisogyny but i was told to move it here cause it was relevant. That sub is the sub I mean when I say ""this sub"". I literally copied and pasted the text, so this was needed for reference


--------------------------

Hello,


I am a 19M. I have been a long time lurker on this sub (r/BlatantMisogyny) and the shit I see here is frankly shocking. I am also on subs like r/IncelTear and the like. One thing I have noticed over the years is that a lot of young men get drawn into this hateful mix of misogyny, racism, and nowadays the rise of neo-facism largely because they get angry about stuff in their life like being unable to find a date combined with a very strong sense of entitlement. A lot of these guys also had mental health issues when they were younger or whatever. As a young man myself, I've had to deal with people like this and one thing that I always hear when arguing with nut jobs who believe women only like asshole guys or whatever (you know typical PUA, MRA shit), is ""what do you know, you haven't dated much"". Which, is true (I haven't really dated much), but doesn't actually disprove anything I'm saying (like the massive amounts of evidence of online harassment of women, various forms of misogyny in the workplace and such, you all know what I'm talking about since you're presumably on this sub). Regardless, this gets to my question. A lot of young men get sucked into all this hateful stuff online when looking for other young men who haven't dated a lot or just looking for advice. Hell, I've looked for relationship advice online (though I always do so carefully because I know that the internet is full of MRAs and PUAs). Here's the thing, you can pretty easily find PUA stuff online, but I'm not as aware of anti-misogny dating advice sites online (if that makes sense). Now, first a couple disclaimers. I know that there are a lot of guys out there who use feminism as an excuse to meet women and act like a ""nice guy"" and then go full incel when they get rejected. That's not the sorta thing I'm talking about here. Others use it as a way to try and get laid. Frankly, I don't blame a lot of women for being kind of suspicious of men who claim to be feminists, a lot of men have tried to hijack it for their own ends. I don't want to be one of those guys and certainly hope I'm not coming across that way (tho, I'm sure that's a sentence you've heard before too. I get it if you don't believe me, that's fine, I can honestly understand and I won't try and convince you in a reddit post). Anyways, that gets me to the crux of my question:

At one point or another, everyone is going to need relationship advice (no matter the gender, orientation, etc). Where can people find relationship advice online that isn't written by PUAs or MRAs? Like a website that emphasizes enthusiastic consent and not negging women in a bar or whatever. A lot of young men identify with guys like Jordan Peterson or  that Steffen guy who's last name I can't spell and am too lazy to look up. Where can I try and re direct guys I know who are going down that path? Hell, such a site would be useful for me too, I certainly need advice from time to time but I ready don't want to contribute to misogyny and the like. Also, do you agree with my assessment of why a lot of young men get dragged down that rabbit hole?

Again, sorry if this comes across as a guy trying to hijack feminism to meet women or whatever, like I said that's really not my intention though of course I can't and don't expect you to believe me.",1
"Ask Feminists Rules, FAQs, and Resources",,1
Do you have a problem with women who want to be attractive or value her appearance highly?,"(I know the title sounds accusatory/demeaning but trust me that's not the intention)

I notice within feminist circles whenever a woman expresses feeling discontent about her looks &amp; wants to be attractive, she gets told ""pretty is not the rent you pay to exist as a woman"" and I frankly think it's unhelpful. There are also women who put more value into their appearance than their accomplishments etc, or enjoy being complimented on their looks more than their personality and achievements, and these women get told the same thing that they shouldn't value their appearance so highly. That they're just playing into what patriarchy wants, and therefore they should stop doing that.

Like it's true that women need not to value their appearance highly, but does that translate to women *must not* do so? I find that the opposite of liberating women, if that's what the intended message is.

During my late teens I used to find myself unattractive, and I worked very hard on my appearance to become content with my looks years later. And I was so lucky that when I told my peers about my problem, they gave me actual advice on how to improve my appearance rather than ""no, that's what the patriarchy wants, pretty is not the price you pay to exist as a woman, you should be ok being unattractive..."" etc. Like what would i possibly do with this information?

What if it's your female friend or relative or daughter who told you that she wants to be more attractive? Would you tell her ""no, that's what patriarchy wants, so you should not want that"" or would you support her wishes and give her advice on improving her looks?",1

What do feminists think of negotiating with the Taliban?,"I ask this question at a trying time in the global context of the war on terror and the war in afghanistan. It is clear that only negotiation and peace process will end the killing and stop the bloodshed from flowing in the fields and on the streets. But whatever happens, the Taliban will remain a force in Afghan politics and will have a big say in how the future country is run. Of course, this war was sold as a war for women, to liberate them from the Taliban and the patriarchal Islamic man. Now, feminists find that their war goals have not been achieved. The Taliban are nowhere near defeat, the US/Afghan governments are no longer capable of defeating them in battle and the Islamic movement is as strong as it ever was. At this point, what do feminists think of negotiating with the Taliban? Because this means that feminists will have no choice but to make compromises and they are not in a position to make any demands. The Taliban hold all the cards in this area and popular support is decidedly against feminism, even among many women. The Afghan government is however willing to make compromises. So are feminists ok with compromising things like sexual freedom, reproductive rights, education etc. in order to stop the bloodshed and end a war that has killed and displaced millions?",1
"Are songs like ""Throat Baby"" misogynistic?","So I wasn't raised ""right"" in any sense of the word, so we'll get that out of the way.

My first exposure to feminism came from reading blogs like Jezebel and XO Jane in the early 2010s. And I've always been confused about hip hop and misogyny. To me it seems like stuff like country music or rock and roll could take a lot of crap for misogyny, but then I'd hear some sexually explicit lyrics that don't actually treat women that well in hip hop and it just never seemed to get the mainstream hate that other genres did. But I'll grant that it's entirely possible that just because I listen to so much more hip hop, and the only times I've ever read about country or rock and roll were when they were in the media, that maybe I just didn't get the full picture. I know that people have gone off to hip hop for misogyny, but I don't know it just doesn't seem like it's that frequent of topic.

So the ""Throat Baby"" comes out, and we'll here are the lyrics:

https://genius.com/Brs-kash-throat-baby-go-baby-lyrics

And I don't know what to think about this. On one hand a lot of people just look at a song like this and think it's a sexually charged song and that makes it okay because talking about sex is okay. I can see the argument that this is just like WAP was where they're just celebrating sexuality, in particular a good blowjob. On the other hand, this just feels like a song that doesn't treat women well? I mean the opening lyrics are calling a woman a bitch and a hoe, and it's an ode her ability to perform sexually for him. 

And I don't know if I'm reading this right. I don't know what really to make of these lyrics. 

So is the song misogynistic?",1

"Do you believe that conventionally attractive women, on the sole basis of being attractive, are discriminated against for being attractive?","So I know that pretty privilege is a thing in many areas. I think this is especially because men may be kinder to them in specific situations, they aren‚Äôt expected to commit crimes, get better treatment when out shopping, and that sort of thing.

But something I also hear is that ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù is often used too often, as a way to discredit attractive people when they come forward about being harassed, sexually or not, and that people have less empathy for them.

Part of this could be a hyper awareness of the ‚Äúhalo effect,‚Äù in which intensifies the jealousy or idea that pretty women don‚Äôt have any real problems.

Personally I think that women that are conventionally very attractive face a double edged sword where they receive privilege they don‚Äôt necessarily want, but people tend to underestimate them in other areas of their lives based on the idea that women can‚Äôt be multi dimensional. 

They also may receive more unwanted sexual attention, and have that dismissed when they come forward, say at work or school, because it should be expected because they are so attractive.

I don‚Äôt know how to word this better so I‚Äôm hoping that somebody will chime that has more complete ideas on this topic",1
"Going out of your way to ""avoid being assaulted""","As a young woman who has mostly lived in small towns, I (fortunately) have very little experience with catcalling, harrassment and other creepy, dangerous behaviours that women can come across when in the public space.

I'm curious as to what strategies some of you who live in big cities have had to put in place in order to avoid that. Did you set up a code with your friends to check on each other? Do you carry mace around or any other object to defend yourself just in case?

She was really mad and then she asked me that she is not really interested to be a housekeeper and she would like to have a career.

How to deal with pua or other sexist groups as a strong and mature woman?,"I'm not sure if this is the correct sub to make this post, so I'm sorr if it's not this one.

English is also not my first language, I just wanted to make it clear.

I don't like to expose myself a lot on the internet, so here's what you can know about me: I'm a girl in my late teens, I have no interest yet in getting into a relationship. So this post is not about dating advise.

I recently discovered the pua and involuntary celibacy wold, groups that basically blame women for not wanting to be involved with them

I never felt so disgusted and discredited with humanity when I saw the materials post and idolized there.

How can a human being look at this and find it normal? Basically, the introdution of the book by one of the main ""God"" of this group, described that his greatest desire was to arrest all woman and watch them go hungry and begging.

Fortunately in the country where I live, this movement is little known, but even so I fear that this virus will spread here.

So, I would like to ask you, mature and more experienced woman. How do you handle the tactics of the pua?

Online harassment is easy to deal with. Ignore, report and block. But what about when you have an ""alpha"" in front of you?

How do you shut up its negs and other tactics?

Have you had any experience?

It is better to ask for when I have this bad luck, at least I am already armed and already know how to deal with them with class.",1
"Is a ""simp"" just the male version of a ""pick me""? And is it a net good for feminists?","I read a thread from a while back on here about simps and had a few comments say that it's good for the men to be raising women up even if he was only doing so because they were women and he was attracted to them and ultimately it was bringing women up. (Ends justify the means I guess). But wouldn't it be problematic for a man to put women as a sex on a pedestal? That's not equality. I'm aware of the existence of people who will use simp for anything including just showing women basic respect and decency. 

But when I refer to simps (on the rare occasion I even use the word) I'm referring to the type of men who believe women can do no wrong, who in any conflict between a man &amp; women will not only always side with the woman but will follow whatever logic allows him to paint her in a positive light even if simply flipping the genders would immediately get him to change his perspective. The kind of guy who sells out his self-respect for a little approval or validation and thinks little of both himself and other men simply for being men. As though we are the lesser brutes who should feel so lucky as to have a woman grace us with her presence.  The kind of guy who gets cheated on for years by his wife for months and then he begs for her forgiveness because he's not man enough and just wants her back. I can go on but I feel the point is adequately made. 

In that same post I saw someone making a comment to the effect of ""if a guy wants to pay a woman for her being on onlyfans good because shes providing a service and she should be compensated for it"". Which I agree with. But there is also a part of me that thinks ""yeah, but I can't help but wonder would this same man pay for said service if he was regularly having sex and had genuine connections with women in his life rather than transactional ones?"" I picture a lonely man who imagines a relationship with a woman who'd never spit in his direction if he wasn't paying her for it and who never will feel a connection towards him. And how he'd probably be happier if he spent his time and effort bettering himself, gaining confidence, working on his attractiveness, and putting himself out there to find someone who loves him, wants him, respects him, etc. 

Furthermore, because he's ONLY defending or concerning himself with women because they're women, he isnt really seeing them as people is he? The double standard reeks of hypocrisy when you just know  that his concern quickly drops if the situation were about another guy. I'm referring to guys like this and not someone whose just being considerate, defending a friend or being decent. I'm referring to the dude who will hold a door open for a full minute because a pretty girl is walking in that direction but would let it slam in the face of someone he isn't interested in standing right behind him. I know it feels good to have people be so considerate. But it just seems unhealthy at a certain point. And like it could lead to some bad outcomes. At the end of the day though, he is improving the lives of women around him, bringing them up and defending them. So is it a noble and ultimately good thing?

I might be in the wrong sub for this. In fact I almost certainly am(maybe shoulda asked menslib). But I've felt a lot more comfortable asking questions here now than before as a good deal of people here are damn decent and reasonable. And I am very interested on a feminist perspective on the importance of men's sense of self respect and value both AS men and as human beings worthy of dignity, boundaries, and compassion. It isnt the greatest concern in the face of issues women deal with XD but this is ask feminists and I did want to ask. Does such a thing even hold a candle to women's progression and success in society? If a man or a large group of men are eagerly putting themselves down to bring women up SPECIFICALLY because they value women more than men is it simply their choice to do so and a net positive because it's bringing women up?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Say that a group of men are doing whatever it takes for the validation, approval, and acceptance of women including devaluing and putting themselves and other men down/treating them unfavorably. Would it be considered a net positive if it brings women up?

"Why do some women gatekeep traditionally ""male"" hobbies?","This just happened. I was scrolling through my facebook feed and there was an article of a local website that said how the second season of Batwoman flopped. So I am scrolling through the comments and ok I see the usual racist and homophobic remarks (the protagonist and the actress, Javicia Leslie, is a black woman and she portrays a lesbian) that I come across on nerdy comment sections in my country (majorly white very conservative).

Of course noone objected to Ruby Rose being a lesbian during S1 but that is another talk. However I saw a comment by a woman saying how this is natural to happen (the show flopping) because women do not watch superhero (I do not know how to write this in a gender neutral way in English) movies/series because they do not relate to the protagonists and the genre. And that is why they make ""female"" tv series with many women e.g Gossip Girls, because it has many women and it is ""easy"" to watch (because yes Aquaman is super complicated to watch jeez) .

I got really perplexed. She herself watched superhero movies but other woman will not/cannot? How does this work exactly? What is their logic behind this?",1
"Former TERFs/FARTs, what made you change and support trans rights?",TERF and FART mean basically the same thing: transphobes who use feminist rethoric.,1
Help understanding intersectionality between feminism and the modern trans movement,"(Very quick background: I was raised by a second wave feminist mother (and a father who makes an effort but is very much a product of his time) but went through most of my childhood in a very conservative area of the country so there weren't many other feminist influences in my life besides my mother until college.)

I am having a lot of trouble reconciling my understanding of myself and my own feminism and what I know about trans rights.  I would like an informed explanation as if I had been in a coma for 25 years.  I'm just six months shy of leaving the 25-34 year old age bracket if that matters.

I've read some things that are apparently said by 'TERF's, if I understand the classification right?  Some of it seems logical but some of it seems like bigoted bullshit.  I feel like I'm missing some critical information, but most internet searches have lead me to information that seems all in or all out and nothing in between.

Side note: I don't get the problem of the who uses what bathroom thing at all; if some creeper is going to spy on women in the women's room they're going to do it whether trans people are allowed in one bathroom or the other.  They're not worried about rules.  Weirdest logic ever.  Let people use whichever bathroom makes them feel the most comfortable and let it go, right?

Is it sexist or racist to say I'd never let a white girl cut my hair?,"there was a 'viral' video a while ago on twitter n IG of a white woman in my area (Dallas Tx) barber cutting hair in a black barbershop.

I reposted it on my IG story and said I'd personally never let a white girl cut my hair. I received lots of DMs from white girls thinking I'm prejudiced, racist or sexist. Personally, I wouldnt mind a black woman cutting my hair. In fact, as long as they black, they good in my book.  I've gotten a few haircuts from white dudes. But I'd never get a cut from a white woman. Especially one who has long hair, wears excessive  makeup, and doesnt look like the type who'd cut hair. People have no issues when others say they prefer tattoo artists who are inked up themselves. But the same doesnt apply here?

Is there REALLY a place for men in feminism?,"If I'm being honest, this question is better suited for a radical feminist. However, the Ask_Radical_Feminists sub is gone, and there's no other group about this...so I'm asking it here. Also, please excuse my english, it's not my first language.

Is there really a place for us in feminism? Can we really be accepted and work as an ally when ALL of us are raised to view women as just commodities for our own gain? If I'm being honest, I don't think we can, collectively at least. I think we're honestly too deep down the rabbit hole.

I've been in a road of deconstruction for the past year, trying to shed every misogynistic idea that was ingrained in my upbringing. Recognizing how women are exploited since birth, how they are denied basic control of their bodies, how they are relentlessly sexualized their entire lives, how POC women (especially black women) are time and time again completely vilified, ignored, abused, and massacred across the world, among countless other issues.

I did so, but I realized there are misogynistic traits in ne that will likely never go away, by virtue of being a man. I realized how there are things I'll never be able to truly let go, because of conditioning or plain ego on my part (as pathetic as that may sound). This made me think how the average man is so blind and so drowned in ignorance and sexist ideals...
I really wonder if there's an opportunity for us to genuinely be allies.

What isn't modern history telling us?,"For history I started taking a history class, of course, it's always jarring to hear about what's been happening through history. However, the topic that I wanted to bring up was just how late it was when women got certain rights in the United States. Yes, I'm fully aware that in other countries there are still very basic rights that aren't granted to others. And reading would be interesting on the topic further as well.

For this theory, I'd like to talk about certain things that a lot of people might find jarring or incredulous about the rights women had throughout the years. The thing that really spurred this for me was learning that women couldn't apply for a credit card without their husband's approval until 1974. If anyone would like to do more reading on that the subject was changed by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

Further reading spurred that there was no Equality Act added to the amendment. Protecting people on all levels of law. This might not seem important for some but it's definitely something that is extremely important.

Issues with co-opting spiritual movements women participate in,"This is inspired by a side conversation in another thread, but a thing I have noticed in spiritual movements I am familiar with - for me personally that‚Äôs Christianity and paganism - is how quickly women‚Äôs spirituality gets co-opted for commercial gain.  Whether it‚Äôs the Christian women‚Äôs retreats that are bigger on clothing sales and diet plans than they are theology or Salem being a ‚Äòfunky‚Äô bachelorette party destination and witchcraft as aesthetic.

All too quickly, it seems like any group where women show up, there‚Äôs this impulse for someone to jump in and try to shift it from the initial intention - women connecting to discuss and work on spiritual/theological matters - and to shift it back to more ‚Äòacceptable‚Äô behavior where women focus on things like relationships and appearance.  

Wondering what other feminists are noticing about how women‚Äôs role in spiritual (or anti-spiritual, as the case may be for women in atheism, who certainly face a fair bit of sexism and erasure) communities, gets co-opted and limited, and how you approach it and what your general thoughts are around how this plays out in communities you know.",1
How to explain the gender gap in nutrition in developing countries?,"OurWorldInData has [a series of plots](https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment) on hunger and undernourishment in the world.

There is only one chart that shows a breakdown by gender. It's about the percentage of children under 5 who are stunted (meaning, more than 2 s.d. below the WHO standard of height-for-age, reflecting poor nutrition).

[https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-stunting-male-vs-female](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-stunting-male-vs-female)

As you can see, in virtually all the documented countries, the rate of stunting is higher for boys under 5 than for girls under 5. The gap is not huge, but it is very consistent across different countries and cultures.  In particular, I find it strange that the observed gender gap is the same in cultures as different as, say, Peru and Zimbabwe.

Do you know what processes could possibly be at the origin of this gap? Is there any feminist scholarship analyzing malnutrition in the developing world?",1

What was your pre-feminism - nah I think genderstereotypes are stupid - moment as a child/teen?,"Hi, so I had a discussion with a friend the other day about traditional genderroles while growing up and how we only understood the idea of feminism in our late teens. At one point she shared the story about how her teachers back in school would always ask the boys to carry stuff like chairs and tables and whenever the girls wanted to help they were like. ""No that's not for girls."" Which ultimately ended in her going anyway and trying to carry twice as much as the boys did.

Funny thing is... I did exactly the same. Just as, I guess, a lot of other girls. 
And we were joking that all the girls who carried chairs in school are now feminists.

I definitely feel such folk exist, and before I became a feminist and sex positive, my own moral judgements against premarital sex/lust were directed towards men and women alike.  My understanding is that religions and their texts especially that characterize sex as sinful, lust as a vice, etc irrespective of gender.  It just so happens that religious and secular societies tend to condemn women more than men, and that systematic violence punishes women more.  It also seems to mostly be secular societies that actively praise men for having a lot of sex.

Why should women have more maternity leave?,"Title says it all.

Edit: No it doesn't I was not clear. I am speaking strictly of non-medical maternal leave and in comparison to non-medical paternity leave.

But as many of you mentioned, feminism wants both. 

Many have said the media portrays maternity leave as a priority but they are not feminists, and what they mean is parental leave in general.

If a woman needs to recover no problem, that is medical maternity leave.

As far as taking care of a child, I think it should fall on the father if they wish to do so as well.

Uneven Maternity leave and no paternity leave (non medical) not only damages men who want to be with their children but women who are assumed to be primary care takers of their child. 

My point is not to say women don't need the recovery time, they do, this is why I clarified with non-medical maternity leave.",1

Is transphobia rooted in misogyny?,"I've been transitioning for a little over a year now and of course, I've run into plenty of transphobes online. I'm noticing a lot of them call themselves ""radical feminists"", but when asked why they think trans women are men, they'll generally say ""real women can get pregnant"" or something else I'd never expect a feminist to think defines womanhood. This has made me wonder if these ""radical feminists"" can even really be called feminists... or if they're just appropriating the word feminist to excuse their transphobia. 

Thankfully I haven't run into any transphobes appropriating feminism in real life and most people have tried to be respectful, but I've still gotten some transphobia. More than one man I've come out to felt the need to tell me that he ""wouldn't **** me"" (no-one asked), and I had a woman tell me that ""if I'm going to call myself a woman, then I should dress like one."" I do have a deeper voice and I don't dress particularly femme, but I don't see why that should matter.

How do I (19 year old man) support feminism without accidentally perpetuating the patriarchy.,"I‚Äôm not really sure how to word this question, but pretty much as the title suggests: how can I, as a man, advocate for women‚Äôs rights/be a male feminist? On the one hand, I‚Äôm concerned that if I speak too much, I‚Äôll come across as disingenuous, just doing lip service to feminism in order to get ‚Äúcredit‚Äù so I seem like a good dude (I‚Äôm sure we all know the type of person I‚Äôm talking about, but if not, look up the ‚Äúgirl-at-a-bar‚Äù women‚Äôs March SNL skit). Or alternatively, I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôd overshadow women‚Äôs own voices, like as in I‚Äôd ‚Äúmansplane‚Äù or white knight. I ultimately have not had the same societal experiences as women, so it‚Äôs not my place to speak on their behalf/explain their experiences with a social injustice (that again I haven‚Äôt experienced). So I would assume I should keep quiet. But then on the other hand, I‚Äôm concerned if I speak too little, I contribute to the patriarchal system because by staying silent I‚Äôm complicit in injustice.

My general philosophy, with really any social injustice, is to let those who have endured it speak to their own experiences, and I just help propagate that message; in other words, I let them lead the charge. But where exactly does the line between the two areas I laid out above lay? As women, in what ways can I be most useful towards achieving gender equality? 

Also, I hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as disingenuous. I sincerely am curious, but I wasn‚Äôt really sure how to ask the question without coming across as kind of a arrogant or like a white knight",1
Do you think it‚Äôs feminist for a woman to join the US military?,"I am from a divided household in which my mother is pro-military, while my father and sister would absolutely not encourage me to join the military. My sister brings up the risk of sexual assault that is prevalent in the military. I‚Äôm fully aware that both men and women in the military can be subject to those crimes, but it affects women in the military more.

Are rape revenge films pro or anti feminist? Or just neither?,"Content warning: Discussions of sexual/physical violence.

I was wondering what some of the feminist perspectives of films like I Spit on Your Grave are, considering that sexual violence against a woman is at the core of that story. I always figured that it was probably one of the most anti-feminist films possible, consider its a series of exploration films wherein the main draw is sexual violence. And the movie shows everything in very graphic detail, and for a very long screen time. So right off of the bat showing something like that for titillation strikes me as a very  un-feminist thing to do.

But on the other hand I was thinking that I don't think anyone could walk away from it thinking that the movie is either in favor of such behavior, or that the victim is shown as responsible for what happened to her. And whatever your thoughts of graphic, violent retribution are, the movie really seems to relish in seeing the rapists being brutalized. And the films show the victim/avenger as getting away with it (well, legally anyway), so if the movie has any message it would be 'People who sexually assault should be tortured to death, and those who brutalize them should not be punished for it.'

That doesn't sound like feminist message, but it also doesn't seem like its pro-rape culture either. And if feminism is ultimately about fairness, brutalizing men who brutalize women is fair in a way.",1

Comeback for an ignorant person,"So, I first off want to apologize if this has been asked before, but I didn‚Äôt see this question posted here, recently at least. 
My question is this: what do I say to a female who believes that ‚ÄúThere should never be a female (American) president because females are much more emotional than males, it is a male job, and a woman could start a war in an instant based on whether or not she is menstruating‚Äù This was not stated quite as delicately, but that is the gist of her argument. I am also a female, and completely disagree with her sentiments.

I did tell her that ‚ÄúJust because she doesn‚Äôt think she would be a good president doesn‚Äôt mean she should bar that opportunity for an entire half of the population just because ‚Äòwomen have emotions‚Äô‚Äù

We may not always feel the same about everything (then again, nobody ever does!), but every person on earth has feelings. It does not matter your gender, sex, status, skin color, heritage, dna.... we all have feelings! A person that doesn‚Äôt could be called a sociopath, and are not fit to be president in my eyes BECAUSE they don‚Äôt have empathy! 

Back to the question- what do I say to this person?! She is incredibly frustrating. As a side note, I have to work in close proximity to her, and she has other gems of opinions such as ‚ÄúThe Capitol riot was a false flag attempt at a coup‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe scriptures say that vaccine companies are going to wipe out 3/4 of the population‚Äù and ‚ÄúA mask is a burka‚Äù. I can‚Äôt say anything too rude or too biting, but I really need something with to come back at her with.

How should a man feel about periods/pms/pmt etc?,"I've just read a thread on a facebook group I'm part of, about women in the group's period experiences. Here are some of the responses -

"" I always start beef with my partner. I get super anxious and jealous when I‚Äòm on my period""

"" I once got mad at my boyfriend that he bought a bag of candy that was 7 euros. I stood in the middle of the crowded city Square screaming at him that I was so mad at him about it.""

"" There was that time when we were cuddling on the bed, he was looking at his phone, and all of a sudden I yelled ""don't ignore me!!!"" And I started bawling. Just... Out of nowhere. Thankfully my boyfriend knows that it wasn't anything personal, it was just stupid hormones""

"" Last week I yelled at my husband because he used the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù utensil to stir his coffee  Then cried.""

(there are 50+ more stories in this vein)

To be honest, reading these have made me feel genuinely stressed and worried about having a relationship. Do I just have accept that women are childish, unstable and mildly abusive at this time? How much shitty behaviour should someone put up with from a partner that has periods before you call it emotional abuse?

I have some mental issues in my family members (both male and female), I have some trauma myself, and I'm really not good with people being unstable and fragile, even if it's just temporarily. I'm not really good at being ""strong for them"". And to be honest I'd have a hard time staying calm and compassionate with the behaviour quoted above.

[Male] [Question/Insight] Unemployment Insurance based on the medieval wage system in the US.,"I'll preface with reaffirming to myself and audience that I am aware that I would not know, what it is, that I do not know. That I could not attest to any opinion which would properly reflect the world beyond myself.

As most of us have come to be made more familiar with the mechanics of the Unemployment Insurance(UI) system in the USA, we can see that there is a crude eligibility screening for applicants. Determination of eligibility for a scaling amount of weekly benefit compensation, weighs itself upon the reported earnings from previous time periods. Thus, having not 'earned enough money' or a taxable work history can mean the DOL deems you not worthy to receive assistance, or very little of it.

Especially in a time where many have become burdened with lack of income, fair compensation and fair health environments during an economic shutdown and a pandemic assistance is critical. I would strongly argue that this system is massively a failure to women and a spit in their faces, when they have contributed so much. Many women take on burdening work roles which are not arbitrary taxable work history. Many women still live under the societal, peer, and familial pressures to be home-makers or work reduced hours for that role. Pregnancy can offset a reflective work history which UI is based off of. Obvious patterns of preference for males in many industries also hinders female record-able work history. 

Now American women, statistically receive less UI, if at all. I cannot know this and have peace. To have an assistance system which deems those who did not serve their lives to income verifiable by some agency. This does not represent me, and I feel it does not represent many others. How thankless are we to our sisters, mothers, daughters, aunts, neighbors, girlfriends, babymommas, wives and countless other shoulders of women that we (males) share our burdens and duties with. This is nothing short of abandoning women because of their situations that can largely be attested to a historically male dominated 'employment' system. These are official decisions which say 'you aren't significant enough' to give even meager assistance to them in a viral pandemic and economic shutdown. Women who have endured just as much, if not more, as men. Women who have given just as much, if not more, than men. Women who ARE our humanity just as much, if not more than, men.

And yet, they wait to recieve word of a paltry assistance which they have earned a thousand times over. Only to be told their history is not known of what they have done. Their history is deemed not enough based on how many dollars they had recorded for earning within this system. Their contributions, work, past year, sufferings, and value beyond recorded dollar transactions.. were not to be met with even the meakest of human dignities in assisting to merely survive. No. They would see you be abandoned, in this arena of fabricated inequality.

I don't know where to start. Somehow we have to change this assistance system.",1

Do boys benefit from having a sibling of the opposite sex while girls are disadvantaged ? how can we change this?,"Studies show in nuclear families (Mother, Father, son, daughter) whether they mean to or not parents are treating there sons a lot differently to their daughters.

 **Types of praise** 

&gt;[Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3655123/) has shown that, although overall boys and girls receive the same amount of praise from their parents, the type of praise they receive differs. [Process praise](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/studies/19-the-one-about-the-parental-praise) (defined as praise for a child‚Äôs efforts and strategies) accounts for 24.4% of the praise boys receive, whereas for girls it only accounts for 10.3%. Being given more process praise from a young age (14-38 months) puts boys at an advantage, as it makes them significantly more likely to have developed a [growth mindset](https://www.innerdrive.co.uk/how-to-develop-a-growth-mindset/) by age 7-8.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore, girls are more likely to lack a [growth mindset](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/how-do-you-actually-develop-growth-mindset) regarding intelligence, and hence attribute their failure to inability, causing a decrease in [persistence and motivation](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/strategies-to-develop-a-growth-mindset), which has the potential to cause a decline in academic performance. This attribution was particularly pronounced for stereotypically male domains, such as maths and science.

 **Educational impact**

&gt;[Parents have differing beliefs](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1128973.pdf) about the maths abilities of their sons and daughters, despite actual performance being similar. Parents believe that, to [succeed in maths](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/maths-growth-mindset), daughters must try harder than sons and consider advanced maths to be more important for sons, as it enables them to enhance their ‚Äònatural‚Äô talent.  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, the stereotypical beliefs held by parents influence their child‚Äôs beliefs about their own abilities more so than their past achievements. This suggests that parental stereotypes may be limiting their daughter‚Äôs scope for academic achievement, an effect that may have long term implications in terms of [aspirations and career choices.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13803610600765851)

**Interests in school**

&gt; Evidence suggests that [parents are more likely to be involved with the school](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/29737745.pdf), such as attending school meetings and contact teachers, when they have a son. The same research also more worryingly showed that parents are likely to have saved more money to further their son‚Äôs education. Not having the same financial support from their parents may stop daughters from maximising their full academic potential. 

 **Time investment disparity** 

&gt;It appears that [fathers are prepared to invest more time in a son than a daughter](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/29737745.pdf), an effect which is thought to occur because fathers and sons have common ground and can share masculine activities. However, this effect is unfortunately not counterbalanced by mothers spending more time with their daughters (instead, mothers share their time more equally). Other [research](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1974-32082-001) has shown that parents are more likely to engage with their son‚Äôs play rather than their daughter‚Äôs. Together, these findings suggest that parents interact more with sons than daughters, which has an impact on their social skills in later life.

I have read many anecdote's online from women and girls who describe being treated differently from their brothers noting that they are often relied on for housework while their bothers are taken care of. as for me personally I have been from a single parent household (since my father died when I was 16 ) and have a sister, so these are all issues I've never experienced personally. 

I imagine these disparities between how we treat our daughters vs sons doesn't just have a negative impact on girls but boys too, in worse case scenarios where daughters are relied on for housework sons are doted upon, sons are left with poor culinary and household skills.

how else do these differences disadvantage both boys and girls?",1
'only in freeing the oppressors can the oppressed truly be free'. do you agree with this statement?,"i swear i've read it on a reddit sub and i just dont know where to find it anymore but it really struck me because of the thoughts ive had regarding the phrase.

in the context of homophobia (specifically homophobia targeted to cisgender men), i think theres a lot of intersectionality with homophobia and toxic masculinity. only if we rid men (specifically cisgender straight men) of toxic hypermacho patriarchal expectations can we truly be rid of homophobia. the way i see it, they feed off of each other, *men should act like this, men should like this, if you aren't, you're feminine, and feminine=gay, gay=weak/bad*. so in a way, the oppressors (cis straight men), if freed of the shackles of the system they themselves perpetuate, can finally truly free queer men of judgment from sexuality.

in the context of feminism, only in ridding men of these mental cages of societal expectations (that the man IS the breadwinner of the house, that the man does the LABOR, that the man SHOULDN'T be doing this, doing that, can only like this, like that) can we expect women to also, truly be free of the expectations of a patriarchy.

Are women the biggest cause of patriarchy?,"Sorry for the stupid question, but im stuck.

I live in a conservative country.  When i claimed men is the biggest cause of patriarchy, my mom objected me, claiming that women was, in fact, the biggest cause of patriarchy.  She explains her reasoning as this: Traditional family structure is much more common in here, and mothers spend much more time with their kids than fathers.  So mothers have much more affect on the childs mindset than the father. But since the mothers also value patriarchy, they construct their kids identity based on their gender roles. For example: ""prepare food for your brother/father, dress like a girl, why would you study?"" etc etc. They also flatter the boys too much by saying ""you are a man! you can do it! anything for my boy! find yourself a girl who can take care of you"" .  You get the idea.

Bc of this, she claims that women are, in fact, more responsible for this situation than men, bc they are the main educators of the children.

To me she does have a point and i dont know how to argue her from here. The debate can go to ""well but what is the origin of patriarchy?"" road, but we are arguing from the ""maintaining it in todays world"" side, not the origins. She also stretches her argument saying that the mothers become this way...because of their own mothers lol.

How can i debunk her? (without rejecting that mothers do spend more time with the children than fathers, bc this is sadly how my country is)",1

That is predatory of course and wrong but growing up, I always saw pedophilia as the former, so why is it used as a catchall. As well, why don't we use it for like 18 dating 16 or 19 dating 17 then",1
Is it really possible to criticize leaderless movements?,"Or more specific to this subreddit, is it possible to criticize Feminism and Men‚Äôs Rights as a movement? 

To preface: I‚Äôve never already discussed this with r/TrueAskReddit and they gave a lot of interesting answers/posed some equally interesting questions. I thought it would make sense to ask people who identify with an actual leaderless movement that I don‚Äôt particularly sympathize with. To be transparent, I‚Äôm a guy, I identify with left wing male advocacy and I‚Äôm very critical of a lot of feminist thought. Despite that, I‚Äôm NOT here in bad faith and will try to engage with each response fairly and honestly.

My girlfriend and I were having a bit of a discussion about leaderless movements such as feminism, Men‚Äôs Rights, Black Lives Matter etc. During the discussion, I realized that when we differed, it was because we often had different subjective experiences and perceptions of each movement. Looking at the discourse around each movement I‚Äôve seen that much of the disagreements around the movement stems from a fundamental disagreement with in the *essence* of a movement: whether a movement is really this or that. 

For example, a Feminist, seeking to discredit the Men‚Äôs Rights Movement, might point to problematic quotes from Paul Elam, Karen Straughan or problematic quotes from the MensRights subreddit. They might use that to say: ‚ÄúSee the MRM is a male supremacy movement that seeks to establish men as more important than women and maintain a patriarchal society.‚Äù A MRA might reply that those people‚Äôs are ‚Äúbad apples‚Äù or are simply ‚Äúproblematic individuals‚Äù and disavow them while saying that those quotes are edge cases that don‚Äôt actually reflect the values and aim of the movement. The movement is simply trying to give men voice and highlight ways in which men are institutionally disadvantaged in society. 

This argument can obviously happen in reverse using quite demeaning and terrible quotes from feminists that can be perceived as dismissing male victimization. And when confronted with the quotes/evidence, the feminist might say that the criticism lacks a basic understanding of what feminism actually is and what the values and terms in feminism actually means before proceeding to give a subjective definition of feminist concepts. 

Obviously this can go around for days and get absolutely nowhere because they‚Äôre both right and wrong because they‚Äôre giving subjective viewpoints of what something means and dismissing anything that doesn‚Äôt fit their definition. 

So my question is, is it possible to criticize movements that don‚Äôt have a central leadership?

EDIT:

I think this conversation has run it‚Äôs course for the most part and while some might think this is a unless rhetorical exercise, I still think this is deeply important because agreed upon definition is what create the context in which we can communicate about certain issues.",1

"Is there a better journalistic or media-based language that we can use with respect to things such as rape, sexual assault, sexual violence and the like which does not suggest that the victim 'had it coming' and does not always presuppose the guilt of the accused?","Too often the language in journalism and other media makes claims about things such as rape, for example, that make the victim's or survivor's claim seem dubious. This to me is immensely troubling.

Equally troubling is how it is often presupposed that the accused is guilty just by the reported victim's or survivor's saying that they are the guilty (**No, I am in no way saying, suggesting, implying or defending any claim or person who says that a person who claims to have been raped mustn't be taken seriously. This is absurd, unreasonable, and not acceptable, as it could impede justice for the reported victim or survivor**).

Both seem very, very troubling and damaging to me.

Do you believe it's damaging when people call themselves feminists when they aren't even educated on the movement?,"Currently, there are a lot of people who care about equal rights, I guess, but in general, a lot are also unaware of what the movement is actually about and are not consciously educating themselves on it. This leads to a lot of them advocating for feminism but at the same time also misogynists themselves(not purposely but because they were conditioned to think that way). So while they call themselves feminists, they also betray the cause when they interact with others. They don't deal with their internalized misogyny first before they call themselves feminists. I feel like this way is damaging to the movement but I'm not quite sure so I'm asking. 

I'm asking this because I'm also guilty of this. I called myself a feminist back when I was 16 and I didn't even exactly know what it was about. I advocated for equal rights yeah, I defended women, rejected victim blaming, spoke up against rape jokes and homophobia, but substantially, was still misogynistic without me being aware. Now that I've read more on it, I realize how much damage I've caused to the name. I undermined and put a bad image on the cause because I used the term haphazardly.",1

I got a question here about fragility...,"There's a question here that sparked this. Basically, it's about 'overcoming fragility"".

"Why is there little to no interest in regards to the effects of lack positive/safe role models for girl's/women? Most importantly, what are the effects on girl's/women and why are they disparaged, dehumanized and degraded for men's failures?","The only time I really see an acknowledgement (and a poor one at that) is when people mostly men say a woman ""has daddy issues"".  Of course this is just disparaging and gaslighting women for the failure of men in their lives.  The conversation surrounding boys/men is very different.  Not only do they dominate the conversation making girl's/women invisible but society has a hell of a lot more interest and compassion for boys/men that lacked a good male role model.  

One of the reasons I believe is due to the fact that men/boys act out disproportionately violent and destructive to themselves and  society in general.  It's another social problem where boys/men are the squeaky wheel that gets the grease.  While girls/women are disparaged and degraded by society for being failed by the men their lives that see's the consequences as something that puts women on a stripper pole, prostitution and of course having ""daddy issues"".

I can't tell you how many times my male co-workers praised me for simply being in my daughter's life.  My mere presence was saving them from the stripper pole/prostitution.  Because to men, ""slutty women"" is the worst possible outcome of being fatherless.  I wasn't praised for my presence with my sons, saving them from gangs, mass shootings, crime or drugs.  No, my greatest gift as a father was saving my girl's from being ""sluts"".  Despite the fact that many of these dudes would talk about exploiting women sexually that they felt had ""daddy"" issues.  They were considered easy targets.

My question is, why is there little to no interest in regards to the effects of lack positive/safe role models for girl's/women? Most importantly, what are the effects on girl's/women and why are they disparaged, dehumanized and degraded for men's failures?

"What is your opinion about ""strategies"" for gender equality (i.e: be more aggressive than necessary, for the benefit of the women who can't)","Hello!

Recently, I've engaged with multiple activists in my local context that have taken radical and strategic postures regarding multiple topics, and this has interested me. I've found myself doing so as well. I'll give a few examples:

* A fellow journalist is investigating minor corruption cases with me. We have a list of 200 people we're investigating. She insisted we focus on males first and only go after the women if we have time afterwards, since they are so easily targeted while the men are so easily let off the hook on these corruption cases. I agreed with her, even though this is _technically_ wrong from a strict, traditional, ""pure"" journalistic approach (of course, journalism has been taught with a male gaze, it's technique is not apolitical).

* A fellow classmate recently shared a tweet explaining how whenever another feminist says she's being ""unnecessarily aggressive"" about something, she thinks to herself ""I need to do this so that women who come after me don't have to"". I wouldn't disagree with her, it makes sense; sure, it can be disruptive In a bad way, but in my personal experience it is tremendously useful for other women to have an ally like that in the workplace, and to know that she can help them if they feel they're not willing to confront someone or something.  

* My boss (a feminist woman) and I needed to headhunt two colleagues for a gig doing policy reporting. We agreed to make a list of women and men, but contacted the women first to make sure that each and one of them would be presented with the opportunity before the men were. Sure, we _could_ have picked at random, or we could have gone for ""parity"" picking one man and one woman, but somehow we felt it was strategic to try to get even more women on the team. 

Since I've started actually working on gender equality professionally, I've seen a lot of people (including myself) adopting ""strategies"" that are geared towards long-term goals but that are not immediately or ""technically"" correct. I want to ask you what your view is on these sort of ""strategic"" actions that can be counter-intuitive or even considered wrong without context, but that quite possibly help build a real, effective gender equality. I suppose this can be seen as a re-hash of affirmative action but I don't think or feel it's the case: I think these are more nuanced decisions and they are, definitely, based more on political and ethical beliefs than on ""evidence"" or whatever.

Note: I'm calling these actions ""strategic"" because they do not offer immediate results, and can even be counter-intuitive in an immediate context. They are strategic because they aim to have an impact in the long run.

Still, I want to make it very clear that even if these decisions come from a political and ethical opinion and set of beliefs, and even though they are definitely not based on evidence, I do not regret any of them. I think that if I ask you to share your opinion of this it is only fair that I expose mine first: I think these sorts of ""strategies"" are necessary. Not only so: I think that any institution, team, workplace or community that supports gender equality *should* be thinking strategically, lest their ""support"" becomes little more than a good intention. This does not mean that I've not seen these strategies be unjust or myopic from time to time. Yes, they can fail, but they must be tried and implemented. That's my opinion anyway, what do you think?",1
BDSM and feminism,"Im 21, and have been seeing a lot from radical feminists on how BDSM and violence during sex shouldn‚Äôt be normalized. I agree it should not be normalized and assumed that that‚Äôs what people like in bed, but if i like it is that wrong?

What do you think of Female Gaze and Male Gaze in film?,"Recently,I found some comments on reddit and youtube, that said female gaze means inclusion of some shirtless muscle guys for female audience.  I want to share my thoughts though I might be wrong. I think objectifying is not good for either men or women. Fan service makes money, but not supposed to be a great art.  Most films in the past whether female led or not ,lacked woman's real point of view. They were portrayed as what men thought. Many women were even brainwashed by them. Lesbianism is a real deal for many women,but used and abused by hollywood as some kind of erotic material for men.Even in porn, lesbian sex is mainly for the hetero men. Only recently things are starting to change. Portrait of a lady on fire is the really great example. Although I am a man, I can really understand and feel the emotions of two women lovers,a very rare one. In contrast, blue is the warmest colour , with the very good story, is nearly destroyed by the unrealistic porn level scenes. Also, Little woman is one of the best film which can be enjoyed by both genders.For me, the female gaze means genuine depiction of women and exploration of their perspectives.
Undeniably the female gaze films are the real deal, and they are far from chick flicks and eye candy. But the major problem is still there, which is women centered stories are still underappreciated ,as seen in previous award seasons. I believe this is due to cultural and religious traditions, which almost always put women in supporting postions, so the wrong ideas are still ingrained in the society.We will see  whether they change in the coming season. Many have praised Joker movie as some kind of rebel man manifesto.Will they also do the same with Promising young woman?",1
I have some questions regarding the male gaze.,"I have been researching the male gaze for quite some time so I can have a deeper and nuanced understanding of the concept. You can answer as many questions as you like.

1. Since feminism have many schools of thoughts and disagree on certain things, **are there any feminists that do not subscribe to the idea of male gaze? If so, what are their criticisms of it, and do they hold water?**

1. During my research, I am getting the impression that the male gaze tells me how fragile the masculinity being portrayed in (Western) mainstream media. As a member of the 'stronger sex', I fail to see how we are strong by deriving power and status from the submission of anyone not us. Then the desire to overrepresent our gender comes across as narcissistic. Is this a common interpretation to have?

1. Given that media aimed for males can still incidentally garner a large female audience, **would you say the inverse is true**? In my mind, video games have a history of marketing towards males yet 50% of its audience is female. However, romance novels market towards women and [16% of its audience are men](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2016/romance-readers-by-the-numbers/). Does this trend follow for other media targeting towards women? Are men less willing to be fans of media marketed towards women?

1. To any women reading this: **Have you ever internalized the male gaze in your life? Do you see yourself as the human being you are or as how a straight man/patriarchy should see you?** Have you overcome this or are you still struggling with it?
 
1. I recently read and watch John Berger's Ways of Seeing. When he discussed the [portrayal of women in European oil paintings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZR06JJWaJM), this statement from him struck me: 

&gt; To be naked is to be oneself. 

&gt; To be nude is to be seen naked by others and yet not recognized for oneself. A naked body has to be seen as an object in order to become a nude. (The sight of it as an object stimulates the use of it as an object.) Nakedness reveals itself. Nudity is placed on display. 

&gt; To be naked is to be without disguise. 

&gt; To be on display is to have the surface of one's own skin, the hairs of one's own body, turned into a disguise which, in that situation, can never be discarded. The nude is condemned to never being naked. Nudity is a form of dress 

**Do you know any examples of art where naked women (or women being sexy) are shown as themselves and not for the male spectator?** Being portrayed as active rather than passive and available?",1
How to cope after your feminist awakening? (And everything seems sexist/harmful),"Im a woman. I've been a feminist for a long fucking time. But recently I've become even more involved in research and going deeper and deeper into the systemic inequalities that exist and how we can act in a way to fight them. Despite being a feminist for a long time, I call this my feminist awakening because I feel like its reached the next (metaphorical) level.

After my 'awakening', I've been feeling exhausted by all the mysogyny and patriarchal systems that surround me. I notice it everywhere. I feel suspicious of men, even those who are close to me, and I have less tolerance for beliefs that sit outside my own. I see sexism EVERYWHERE and I feel depressed and exhausted at the constant fight and fear.

It also makes me worried about what my life means now, when those I love may not have the same views as me. I try to educate them but I have a nasty feeling in the pit of my stomach that I need to be afraid.

Has anyone been through this? Does it get better? Any advice for learning how to live with this?",1

Why is marriage depicted as bad for men and good for women," 

I've always wondered this. In pop culture marriage is always depicted as something men are running away from and as something that women want. Historically, marriage has benefitted men, as they gained someone to do hours of unpaid labor for them and produce heirs. Even in modern day society, women still do around 2 more hours of unpaid labor then men PER DAY. This is even after working the same hours at work. Women's careers stall after giving birth while men's careers flourish.

So why is marriage depicted as a prison for men and not women?",1
Are transpeople a great equalizer for gender issues? Is it trans-phobic to generalize any issue as exclusively ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs issues‚Äù or ‚Äúmen‚Äôs issues?‚Äù,"I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot and I feel like one of the most beneficial outcomes of transpeople becoming more accepted in society is that this has the potential to bring all genders closer together.

What I mean is that if we are to accept transpeople as valid, which we should, then all gender issues now become *human* issues instead.

No longer can we say that pregnancy and abortion are ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs issues,‚Äù rather they are human issues because trans-men can become pregnant and get abortions too. 

Am I wrong? Do I need to rethink this?

If I‚Äôm right, I feel like spreading this train of thought could be really great for men and women finding common ground.",1
Male gaze: Is it an inherently bad thing?,"I've always had it sold to me that the male gaze in films is a problem because 99% of sexuality in films is done for an implied male, heterosexual audience. Therefore any LGBT+ members in the majority of films ever made have had their sexuality ignored while straight men (probably mostly white too) are overly catered too. Which is true, I imagine. Aside form Dr. Frankenfurther from Rocky Horror (and probably Rocky himself from Rocky Horror) I can't think of any famous films wherein someone is sexualized for the titillation of someone who is not a straight male of the top of my head.

Now ignoring that for a second, is there anything actually wrong with films/scenes that titillate straight guys in and of itself? If a straight dude is just enjoy that Salma Hayek scene from Dusk Till Dawn, so long as he doesn't have any notions that his sexual enjoyment is more superior to anyone else's, is it really a problem? Or to be moral does he have to pretend that he's doesn't enjoy what he is seeing, or something like that?",1
Teenagers and Feminism,"Hey everyone! I am a 16 yr old high school female and a proud feminist. I believe in empowering other women and educating my peers (of all genders) about what feminism really is‚Äî equality. 

While I have always known that women face a magnitude of inequalities since I was little, I have recently (within the past year or so) become very aware of all of the subtle sexist things that I face on a daily basis at school/during sports, etc. For example: I am acquaintances with some funny/sarcastic boys, and when I try to make a witty comment back at them, they often don‚Äôt respond or look away. If one of the boys said the same thing I did, it would‚Äôve been ‚Äúhilarious.‚Äù This frustrates me, yet I don‚Äôt know how to respond to since I guess it doesn‚Äôt really matter and I would come off as overly sensitive. 

Another example is that I always feel like I have to prove to myself and others that I can be just as good as boys in school and sports. I know that this is not necessary, but I feel like there‚Äôs this voice in my head that tells me that I need to. I feel like I heard this somewhere else (possibly on another subreddit), but someone described this well: it‚Äôs like all women have a male voice in their heads that tell them that they must live up to certain standards in order to be worthy of equality.

Finally, I hate when boys get upset that girls ‚Äúbeat‚Äù them at something, whether academically or athletically. This realllly makes me pissed.

Sorry for the lengthy rant, but I was just seeing if anyone could relate, and I was wondering if anyone has advice on how to (if at all) respond to these ‚Äúinsignificant‚Äù sexist remarks from my peers? Thanks!",1
Why are certain groups of men (and women) so afraid of men wanting to be more feminine and the glorification of feminized men in the media?,"For some reason, there's this ""boogeyman"" that's been conjured up by certain groups of people who believed that the media and feminists are trying to force men to become more feminine and show more emotion and this is ultimately a bad thing. I've seen this fear being brought up over the years and now I've recently been hearing that people are getting angry over Harry Styles wearing a dress and this is an attack of masculinity in the west. An argument they love to bring up is that every society needs strong men to survive and to protect their families. 

Why are so many guys against this? I hate the fact that these groups of people also bring this fear to the dating scene in which they claim that ""women want sensitive dudes but in actuality they want tough and strong men"". As a guy myself, it especially bothers me that this kind of mindset is used as dating advice among men, both online and offline, and that we categorize guys into two groups.

Can you rationalize why terfs feel the way they do?,"When you think of terfs, do you understand why they feel the way they do? Why they are uncomfortable with MTFs in particular? Why they want to restrict their spaces to cis women only? Or does this make no sense to you whatsoever?

I am solely talking about **rationalizing** NOT agreeing. For example if you ask the FBI why Al Qaeda attacked the twin towers on 9/11, they'll be able to answer you comprehensively and give you a detailed report, but of course at the same time they don't *agree* with the attacks themselves. This shows that with rationalization they are fully on board 100%, while with agreement they are 0%. Is this how you feel about terfs? Do you 100% rationalize their views while 0% agree with them?",1
What will replace patriarchy?,"Based on the basic human instinct to always have someone under their boot (be ""better"" than someone else) there would need to be something in place of patriarchy, the only question is what? If it's wired in human DNA to dominate, then who will we dominate?

Edit: I see some people saying things that make it seem like I said sexism is in our DNA, and that it's ok to be sexist. I said it's natural to want someone UNDER YOUR BOOT, not that it's natural for a man to feel superior to a woman. It's the same with racism. I will never condone either, or things like homophobia, transphobia, e.t.c. things like that are DERIVED from the instinct, but are not hardwired. The only thing about this that's hardwired is the fact that humans always want to be the best, and we will do that through hate and oppression.",1
"What type of ""shaming"" is acceptable?","I was wondering what type of shaming is considered acceptable and what is considered unacceptable?

I think ""slut-shaming"" and ""kink-shaming"" is unacceptable and I don't think it's controversial to hold such an opinion in the feminist community. In addition, I think so called ""creep-shaming"" as the MRA extremists put it is acceptable in many cases because ""creeping"" is often just plain harassment. 

However, I feel that so called ""john-shaming"" (i.e., shaming people who purchase sex) is also unacceptable. I realise that might put me at odds with the sex-negative component of the feminist community but I honestly feel that if it's wrong to ""slut-shame"" than, ceteris paribus, it's wrong to ""john-shame"". I think it's hypocritical to endorse ""john-shaming"" while reviling ""slut-shaming"".",1
"Not sure where to ask this question, but whats are your thoughts on the 3 stages of womanhood ""maiden, mother, crone"" and is there an equivalent for men?","My mind is being blown right now as I'm reading ""The Crone"" by Barbara G Walter where she explains that before Christianity, the creator of the world, the spirit of earth, was female, and the ""Virgin Mary"" as the mother of God reborn was a way to make Christianity more palatable to prospective converts. In the story, Mary being a virgin mother, makes her the embodiment of the Maiden Mother, fertile yet pure, and excluding the Crone from sainthood. Old women being further stigmatized for accusations of witchcraft and whatnot, the idea of aging becomes extremely negative.

Why can't the employer be allowed to decide how much they pay? Isn't it the woman's responsibility to negotiate on her own?",1
"Discussion about legal and common definitions of rape, along with the limits of ‚Äúprosecutability‚Äù in regards to ‚Äúrape by deception‚Äù. A philosophical conundrum?","I will first say what I mean by the title. My apologies if it comes off as incoherent - I can‚Äôt think of a good way to say what I want easily right now.

What I mean by ‚Äúprosecutabilty‚Äù in regards to the limits of ‚Äúrape by deception‚Äù is how well a law(s) (if they exist) can incriminate people for deceiving their partner during sex (like lying about who they are, or in this case, taking contraception) without falsely incriminating people who didn‚Äôt actually deceive (like forgetting to take birth control, but say they did because they mistakingly think so)

I was just browsing the sex forum and I came across this:

[Redditor claims his ex-girlfriend lied about using contraception, and tried to ‚Äúbaby trap‚Äù him](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/kww7jr/i_m23_realized_i_might_have_been_raped_dont_know/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

He wasn‚Äôt sure if he was raped or not. I commented in there right away saying he was, but was quickly corrected that the legal and dictionary definition of rape does not consider his scenario to be rape (USA?). However, I think the OP is from France, judging from his post history. I removed my comments because I was speaking from ignorance. Many people said he was not raped.

Question: If ‚Äúrape by deception‚Äù is not acknowledged in the legal/dictionary definition of rape (or not enough to acknowledge men being deceived), should rape by deception be acknowledged? How well would it work? Is it justifiable enough to acknowledge it in the legal definition of rape?",1

Not like a government draft, but... it just sort of seems like a missed opportunity? I'm more confused than anything.

Are my parents right?,"Hi I am a 23 year old woman and feminist with a personal question.  
I've got the opportunity to be a model for a body positivity, lgtbq+ friendly overall amazing underwear brand (La Fille D'O). The style of the photographer and also owner of the brand is very direct; with visible nipples, hair and everything.   


I am an artist myself and my work is very much about the female experience especially about sexualization of our body. I go completely nude for my own photography, paintings and performance all the time. So even without this shoot my body is out there, in a direct way.  


I told my parents the news I would be doing this shoot. They had no problem with me modelling as a lingerie model, but they have a problem with this brand because it is too nude, too direct, overall not pretty. They came with the following arguments;

\- what would the rest of my family think? 

\- What if I needed another job which won't appreciate the nudity?

\- I would make their life harder by doing this shoot because they would have to face my family and, wait for it, their colleagues. My father even fears losing his job because of these hypothetical pictures.

This last one really stuck with me. Aren't they just making me feel guilty for living my life, which I try to live in an empowering way?

I am wondering what you think? Is there any way I would really be such a burden? Is this a valid reason for a 23 year old to feel guilty, maybe even hesitating doing the shoot to begin with.

Women should just lower their standards,"Edit:   
I don't know why I get downvoted but if it's because of the title I'm terribly sorry. I should've put it in airquotes so it's clear that this doesn't reflect my opinion.

Hi, I've got a question.

My brother and I talked about incels and their inability to have sex and I've stated the argument that inceldom is bullshit because in human societies it's the rule that everyone eventually can get a sexual/romantic partner.

A little bit later he stated that incels have it worse because men (and by extension incels) have it harder on the sexual market than women because women will always find a guy who's desperate and horny enough to have sex with her.

I was sceptical and told him that there are women who can't have sex like femcels. He didn't believe that they even existed. I send him this [article](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/femcels-vs-incels-meaning-reddit-discord) and we still had a discussion where he just repeated that men have to ""earn"" sex while women can just go in a bar and ask a guy for sex. In his view femcels could get sex if they just lowered their standards.

I said that by his logic an incel could just have sex with a sex worker and then he wouldn't be a sexless virgin anymore and he just responded that it isn't the same because they didn't ""earn it"" because getting laid is an ego boost and when you don't ""persuade"" a woman to have sex with you, you don't get that ego boost.

So...

How different would today's discussion on reproductive rights be if Silphium still existed?,"This might be an oddly specific question, but hear me out:

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently read a discussion online on reproductive rights in history and somebody brought up Silphium, which I found very interesting:

[Silphium](https://allthatsinteresting.com/silphium) was a plant used by locals of Cyrene (now Libya), and later the Romans, as a cure for various ailments. The resin from within the stalk would be used to treat nausea, fevers, chills, and even corns on the feet.

Its arguably most popular use was as an extremely effective form of contraception.

The plant acted as an abortifacient as well as a preventative measure. A single dose of the resin from the plant would induce menstruation, effectively rendering the woman temporarily infertile. If the woman was already pregnant, the induced menstruation would lead to a miscarriage.

Unfortunately, due to its popularity as a contraceptive and because Cyrene was the only place where the plant would grow due to a combination of rainfall and mineral-rich soil, it was harvested to extinction by the end of the first century AD.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my question is, as the title says: If this plant wasn't harvested to extinction, do you believe today's discussion on reproductive rights, specifically abortion, would be any different? I'm asking because back in the day, pretty much everyone had Silphium in their herb cabinet, making it a very easily accessible and commonly used contraceptive.

I personally believe that if such a contraceptive still existed today, it would heavily shift the discussion in favor of reproductive rights.",1

Although the fan base is predominately young white men, they usually seem to talk about the female fighters in a positive light. Despite some objectification, most female fighters are admired for being incredible skilled and resilient.

On top of all of this, different ethnicity's and nationalities are highlighted. Notable female fighters in the division are: Ronda Rousey, Amanda Nunes, Cyborg, and many more.

Why is consent treated differently for sex than in other situations?,"I was summarily banned from two X chromosomes for asking this, so I hope to get a better answer here. The stance by this sub seems to be that drunk individuals cannot give consent and that all sex with drunk individuals is thus by extension rape. This causes some issues when both individuals are drunk, which would imply that both are raping each other, but that‚Äôs not the meat of my question.

This idea seems to originate from statutory rape, which has significant legal backing and argues that children cannot consent and thus any sex with children is rape. However, this is where the parallels end.

Children are (in most Western jurisdictions) excluded from being able to conduct business transactions, since they cannot make autonomous decisions. If my child were to open a brokerage account and blow all his money on speculative instruments, I could take the brokerage to court for allowing a child to trade on their platform. If my child were to buy a car, I could return the car and get the money back or again take the matter to court. If the car were damaged, I would have to pay the damages since I am responsible for my child.

If I got drunk, blew all my life‚Äôs savings on speculative instruments and sued the brokerage on the basis that I was drunk at my computer, no court would rule in my favor. If I damaged someone else‚Äôs property while drunk, I would still be liable and have to pay damages. If I killed someone while drunk, I would likely get a more lenient sentence, but I would still do time. In no other context does being drunk absolve me of my responsibilities or nullify my decisions as it literally is my fault for getting drunk. What‚Äôs more, in the case of DUI, I would be punished under a law designed exclusively to punish drunk people deciding to drive.

My question is then why do some feminists‚Äîmy brief research on this sub suggests that it is the orthodox view here‚Äîabsolve drunk individuals of being responsible for their decisions when it comes to having sex? I don‚Äôt want to put words into anyone‚Äôs mouth, but you wouldn‚Äôt do it for any other potentially life-altering situations such as blowing your fortune on speculative financial instruments and forcing the brokerage to cover the losses, or getting into a car after a bottle of tequila.",1

Oversexualisation or slutshaming ?,"Hello evrybody.

Today I saw a press cover for a metal journal.
It was about a female frontes band and only the female singer was on the cover, in a very tight and very short dress with high heels etc... there was also a photo of a man on the cover : he was playing guitar at a concert. The photo of the woman is much more erotic and the photo of the man much more in context.

The other covers of the magazine are bot that bad but I realised that when they talk about masculine band they show the entire band and when it's female fronted band, it's only the lead singer in big.

It felt bad to me because I really felt like the lead singer was oversexualized. They have much more to offer than just their look !

But I'm conflicted because I don't want to shame someone to like dressing sexy or to like theses kind of photoshoot...

"How do you feel about Jordan Peterson's message that ""men like things and women like people""?","I struggle with this, because some of Jordan Peterson's messages bother me but others are things I've experienced in life. 

----

For example, right now I work as an interior visualization artist and I'm the only male on my team. I just notice that my co-workers prefer to talk about stuff like what they did with their SO's, social interactions that they've had, and when they mention things that they did on the weekend it's usually something more social or involving other people. Even the TV shows that they talk about like one called ""Love is blind"" or something is usually a TV show that involves a more social setting. I'm finding it very hard to have interactions with them that I enjoy because of how different our interests are and I'm considering switching back to game design.

------

However, when I use to work in game design prior to covid, my team was all men and one woman - and we talked about typical guy stuff like sports (boxing, martial arts, etc.), gaming, new anime fighting shows, cars, etc.

We always tried to include her in our conversations but she seemingly had nothing to contribute or had no interest, and she eventually quit for reasons I don't know.

----------------------

I guess it could just be a difference in personalities rather than gender, but when I started thinking about it I just noticed that throughout my life when I'm with men we talk about things or concepts but around women I'm forced to talk about people or social stuff.

How can I talk to my boomer dad about his toxic masculinity?,"My (26m) dad (51m) has fallen out with my sister (21f) because her first bf in years fell asleep accidentally in her bed, after my dad had said that he couldn't sleep over. 

My sister has mental health issues and I've not seen her this happy in years, her guy isn't text book bf material but he's clearly very good for her. 

When I brought my gf over for the first time my dad had zero issues with her sleeping over, he has zero issues that my gf is unemployed.

However with my sister. Not only did he forbid her bf from sleeping over, he also got so angry when her bf accidentally fell asleep in her bed. And he has been vocally bothered by the fact that my sisters bf is unemployed. When asked about this double standard he said something along the lines of ""it doesn't matter if his gf is unemployed because he will be working whilst she is pregnant and looking after the house"".
And he also has also tried to prevent and been vocally against my sister having sex, when he displayed no such aversion to my sex life. When I was sleeping around, I'd tell him where I was going and what I was doing, and we'd laugh about it and that was it. But if my sister wants to sleep with her actual bf, he has a huge problem with it. 

How can I show him that his toxic masculinity is ruining his relationship with his daughter. He won't be very receptive to ""progressive vocabulary"", and I don't really know where to start with him. I just know that I need to do something before it really does something irreparable to my sister and her mental health.

Update:
I called him, it went great. Thank you so much for your advice. I went at it from the angle of how its making my sister feel, whilst showing him how he treats us differently and how that makes my sister feel. I told him that he needs to tell my sister that he is not going to make it difficult for her to see her bf, and that he will be supportive of the relationship, just like he was with me.

Insulting language that isn‚Äôt ableist?,"Hi. I want to preface this by saying my brother is disabled and I absolutely do not wish in any way to use ableist language or accidentally perpetuate any ableism, which is why I am here to ask the following questions. Also please excuse my usage of ableist and potentially ableist terms throughout this post, I just need to explain my point and obviously I need to use these terms to explain my point. 

I recently learnt that the term ‚Äòcretin‚Äô originated as a medical term, please excuse that I can‚Äôt remember the exact condition it was a term for. But basically it means that using this word in an insulting way could be ableist. 

This got me thinking, if I, and as I‚Äôm sure 99% of other people, are completely unaware of the etymology of the word and it‚Äôs links to disability, does that still make the word ableist? If the word only exists for most people as an insult or a variation on ‚Äòidiot‚Äô (which I also understand is problematic too), then is it ableist to use it if it‚Äôs developed waaaay past its original usage to the point where I‚Äôd likely say it‚Äôs not used for its original purpose at all anymore? 

I also had the question of, if I want to insult someone and call them an idiot, how can I do this without using potentially ableist language? I obviously will not use the word ‚Äòretard‚Äô, and understand words like ‚Äòlame‚Äô, ‚Äòdumb‚Äô and ‚Äòmoron‚Äô are problematic too. I just wondered if there were any words that could safely be used and considered not ableist. 

I do not want to come across like I‚Äôm saying ‚Äúbut why can‚Äôt I use those words!‚Äù I more so wanted to start a discussion on where the line of acceptability and non-ableism can be drawn in terms of this area of language. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve began thinking about and I think it‚Äôs important to recognise the roots of these words, but it is also important to understand the widely understood meanings of these words. Which is why I‚Äôd like some input from anyone who is willing to have an open conversation on this topic, and if anyone reading this has any varying disability themselves, I would extremely appreciate any input or opinions you have on this topic. I hope I don‚Äôt come across badly through this, it‚Äôs just a curiosity and a desire to understand the language I‚Äôm using and what words I need to remove from my vocabulary vs what is still acceptable.",1

What do you think of Pauline Harmange‚Äôs ‚ÄòI Hate Men?‚Äô,"‚ÄòI Hate Men‚Äô (or *Moi les hommes, je les d√©teste*) is a book released this past August by French feminist Pauline Harmange that, according to Wikipedia, calls for a feminist reclamation of misandry:

&gt;	In the 96-page booklet, Harmange aims to ""understand misandry and to give it back the right to exist."" According to her, feminists have always needed to pretend not to hate men so as not to lose them as allies. But in her view, misandry is not only ""perfectly justified, but also necessary"". She advises women to reduce their relationships with men and toxic masculinity, in order to rediscover the benefits of the ""sisterhood"" among women.

Naturally, this caused a lot of controversy when the French Ministry of Gender Equality initially tried censored it for inciting hatred, which was eventually reversed when there was an outpouring of defense for Harmange and the book. It sold thousands of copies versus the originally printed 400, and will soon be translated into English.

Concept of revocable assent for teens engaging in sex,"This lawyer, Jennifer Drobac, works in sexual harassment law and has written on the sexual exploitation of teenagers. Her proposed framework for age of consent is: 1) raise the age of majority from 18 and 2) for young people within a certain age range (e.g., 16-21), allow them to ""assent"" to sex with significantly older people, such that after a time, if the young person feels they were exploited, they can retroactively revoke their assent, making the encounter nonconsensual. 

I understand that alternatives to this are to simply stagger the ranges in which people of certain age ranges can legally consent (e.g., 18 can only go as young as 17, 19 can only go as young as 18, etc.), but Drobac's assent law may be interpreted as more liberal, i.e., the concept of assent permits a 16 year old to have possibly damaging sex with someone significantly older, and only provides protection in retrospect. But her argument for this liberalness is that teens need to learn to make important decisions, lest ""we risk retarding their growth and maturation."" She then says that ""if we tell teens to ‚Äújust say no‚Äù to sex, we deny a normal part of their  development and sexual exploration that must occur in an  age-appropriate way.""

Opinions on this approach? Is it worth it, while raising the age of majority, to also allow older people to have sex with people below this bright red line, so long as they are provided protection in hindsight, so that society's teens can still develop normally? Drobac argues that this would be a powerful mechanism for dissuading many predators, because they may not want to have the possibility of someone retracting their consent, years after their fact, hanging over their head.

"How do you abandon the instilled, prejudiced image of a sexy woman, and refute the sexists' line, ""Ugly women's sexuality is a joke""?","The status-quo patriarchy forms the concept of 'women'. This male society condescendingly defines what a woman is/female archetypes. According to patriarchal society and media, our sexual validity is confirmed only when we meet men's beauty standard (which might vary by culture, but where I live, they place importance on youth, big boobs/hip, thin waist, long eyelashes, thick lips, pink cheeks, and this laundry list goes on...); otherwise, they don't consider us 'valid women' as in the line, ""Ugly women's sexuality is a joke"".



I'm 42 and aging. I'm sick and my face is pale. My body has belly fat, and my boobs and ass are sagging. So my sexuality is a joke? Patriarchal society and media every day teach me that my body doesn't conform to their beauty standard and I need to 'fix' my flaws to be sexy.",1

Does intersectionality affect grad admissions?,"I feel that white people AND men are given an advantage from the get-go \[ON AVERAGE\]. Men are pushed to pursue careers that require higher education. 

Additionally, BIPOC face an incredible amount of disadvantages \[ON AVERAGE\] which hinders their ability to pursue further education. E.g., having to work jobs while in school, increased amount of issues at home, lack of academic remediation because of low-income. Any of these issues can negatively affect a person's academic performance and I feel that even with someone who tries their best and rises from all the racialized disadvantages, the effects will come out sooner or later.

I speak from experience because I feel that this has impacted my ability to get into grad school. Some grad schools consider diversity, but others do not.

Wouldn't the complete success of feminism lead to an existential crisis for humanity?,"If gender is a construct, If sexuality is a construct, If we treat everyone equally, If we are nice to others, If we have respect for all professions, If we have socialism.

Like if we don't make fun of someone for being obese / looks, they are secure in their body, and they won't make any attempts to improve. If everyone has enough money to meet their basic needs, what is the motivation for anyone to work hard? Why should any woman want to be a doctor and not become a sex worker \[If they have the same respect as professions\]? Why should any man want to become a soldier or a coal miner? If all genders are treated equally, then why do we need relationships at all - can't I find both masculine and feminine qualities within myself?  If all races are treated equally, then is there a point to having different countries at all? Why is accumulation of wealth bad - aren't these just people who are good at playing the game that the society has set, you want to penalize them because they are good at playing the game? Do you think they are there because they cheated? Do you think you could do the things that they have done and not be like them?  And if accumulation of wealth is bad, then why work than the bare minimum if we have an Universal Basic Income? For instance, people get motivated because they want fame, respect, money, stability, academic merit - that would not mean anything then? Because of these factors, humanity has been able to achieve extraordinary things.

So if feminism is successful in its entirety, isn't the worst thing that can happen to a human being is to be born in the first place?",1
Regarding fictional male characters objectification,"Hello there!

I'd like to consider myself a feminist - I'm afab, and I see and recognize a lot of the misogyny and sexism that's in our culture. I've always thought that the objectification of fictional female characters is a real issue, however recently I had a discussion with someone else regarding objectifying male characters.  

Basically, I expressed how I found this fictional videogame character hot, and that was the main reason I liked him as a character. I was then told that was gross, and that I was being objectifying. I want to ask - was what I said weird, and objectifying?  

I don't really know what to think myself, because if a guy told me that the main reason they liked a fictional videogame woman was because she was hot, I wouldn't really ... be bothered? But maybe I'm wrong on that too, and for that reason I wanted to hear different opinions.",1
A question on abortion in a hypothetical ideal future: All thoughts are appreciated,"Hey, so curious it‚Äôs question, would there be an ideal world where abortions wouldn‚Äôt need to be a thing. As a person who believes in the equity of all peoples, being an anarcho-communist, and that kind of applies to the unborn for me aswell. Abortion is just a hard topic for me, I agree with a lot of feminist thought, but I can never really form a full opinion on abortion, so the best I can do is hope for a scenario where it‚Äôs no longer a necessity. So would you think abortion would still need to be a thing of in this hypothetical world(from an American standpoint) sorry non Americans if some of this already applies to you, we kind of live in a third world country pretending to be first world! But if you could give birth without financial cost(entirely free!) and knew that your child was going to be given another place(not necessarily in a generic nuclear family unit) to be fed, educated, and grow up to be a great person without you needing to take care of the child or even ever here of it again. And since we live in a capitalist society you could even get a nice check(my original ideas come from a non monetary society, but hace to update for more realistic sensibilities). I  understand the idea that it is a woman‚Äôs choice, and I respect that as I‚Äôm not going to bad mouth someone for doing it or be one of those weird people who protest outside clinics, but there‚Äôs got to be a way, right? Maybe it‚Äôs a bad example, I‚Äôm pretty bad at expressing my ideas into written word, but could there be a world of no abortions? Thank you for any and all opinions, I just really want to hear peoples ideas. I hope you have a good day wherever in The world you may be.


Edit: I wanted to add an apology for coming off as ignorant. I realize I have much to learn about this topic and am eager to learn from everyone here. I know this is a sensitive and traumatic topic and I probably come off as acting like a fool who thinks it mean nothing, and I apologize for that perception. I‚Äôm not always the best at conveying my emotion in written word, much less spoken, and I want you all to know that I appreciate everything you guys are giving me to grow my knowledge. I appreciate it all greatly. Thank you!

Edit+: Alright, thank you everyone for your insight. I‚Äôve learned a lot about abortion and a bit about humanity on Internet forums, which I should‚Äôve expected(I think someone with a lot of alt accounts just came by, probably). It is all appreciated toward my ability to grow my knowledge in hopes of creating a better world. I will no longer be responding to anymore posts(for my own sake mostly) and hops this thread will be a place of positive discourse on how this topic applies to other people. Gracias, and all of you have the time of your lives!",1
What do you think ADOS (AFRICAN DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES) and their views on liberals and feminism as whole? As well as what you think of Pan-africans?,"ADOS means AMERICAN descendants of slaves. Basically, a black american who's here as a result of slavery. They're all around social medias. You can read about them, or I could post links if needed. But they mainly reside in the corners of twitter or yt. 

Pan-africans are black people who believe that ALL black people of african descent, no matter where they're from, should unite. What differs from ADOS and Pan-Africans is that ADOS are for BLACK AMERICANS descendant of slaves, and believe in reperations for them. And Pan-Africans is for every black person of african descent.

I've seen a lot of what ADOS/Pan-africans have to say. Particularly about politics and such. They're an explicitly anti-feminism group. They believe that it's a group for white women. Or white people in general. And often bring up their past as a reason they don't support it. And believe feminism is nothing more than brainwashing and a destruction to their communities.

In general, frrom what I've gathered, both groups don't support or vote for any politicians/candidates who AREN'T black. They only support black politicians. And only when these politicians made it clear they center black people in their TOP 5 priorities. Most of them didn't even vote (what i read again) in this past 2020 election. As they simply don't care, and see GOP and DEMS as political parties that don't care about them

Also, they absolutely has the term person of color. You'll get called names if you refer to them as that. Not to mention, in my experience, they tend to be VERY hostile towards non blacks.

So what's your opinion of them as whole? What do you think of them? Feminists who are black, how do you view? And feminists who are not black, how do you also view them?",1
What do you think of barely legal women opening onlyfans accounts?,"To start off, I want to say that I am in no way against making onlyfans accounts, nor am I against similar jobs. However, I believe this harms young girls more than it helps. You see girls creating accounts as soon as they turn 18 and it just doesn't sit well with me.

I mean, it's good that they're given a platform in which they are in control, but I just can't get it off my head how they were led to this decision. Most likely, these girls were hypersexualized and fetishized when they were minors. I don't know if this is the right term, but isn't it possible that they were ""groomed"" to think that their body is for the public? I may be talking nonsense here so please do correct me if I'm wrong! Thank you",1
Any recommendations for podcasts or books or articles or anything to help cure my internalized misogyny?,Thanks &lt;3,1
So why are abortions morally acceptable?,"Please don't just spam me ""*stop trying to control women*"" ""*women should be able to do whatever they want to their own bodies*"", it doesn't hold up. What women fail to realize is that we don't want to control what they do with their bodies, it's just that the baby isn't apart of it. And for those that think the baby is her body, how many fingers does a pregnant woman have, 20!? I don't think so.

Well some people might say the baby is using up resources of her body, and they have no obligation to keep it alive. Sort of like if someone needed a blood transfusion from you, you can decline because you have no obligation to anyone else. But still what women fail to realize is that there is a *big* difference between passively allowing a tragedy to occur and actively triggering the events that lead to someone's death. Not only are you consciously making the decision to end someone's life via killing, but you act as if getting pregnant was completely random and out of nowhere. The baby was asked to be brought into this world you're irresponsible decisions did that.

Another argument most people make is, it is a fetus and not alive. This is probably the most tricky because we start getting a little deep. What constitutes someone as alive? Is someone in a coma alive? I mean someone in a coma as *VERY* little brain activities, so is it ok to pull the plug these people? Are the elderly with dementia worth putting down because they aren't responsive to the world any more? Most people would say that they've already been living, so to end that would be wrong. And it's like what? A prerequisite to living is you had to have lived??? Anyways that's just assuming they think it's alive (at any point they think it is alive in the womb). Some people might say if it is in the womb it's not alive. We'll if that's the case what's the difference between a child that's just been born and a baby in the womb for 6 months? There's not a lot of difference.

The last argument many people use is what happens to the baby after its born. I understand that life can be hard and having a baby probably just add to the problem but that understands no circumstances can you just kill someone out of convenience. They usually go off on a rant about how the baby is gonna live a terrible life and grow up poor. But you have you have to understand, you wouldn't kill a 2y/o  because it would convenient you, so you shouldn't kill an unborn baby. People will also say what about rape cases? And if I'm being honest I'm not entirely sure myself. I mean on one hand a child of rape didn't asked to be born and in the other the mother forced against her will.

But anyway I think abortions are morally wrong and if you think you got another reason I didn't consider or a counter-argument I'd love to hear it.",1
Do you think there are any gender double standards that *should* exist?,"People bring up double standards between men and women very often in gender related debates. That if a man does this, he's considered X, a woman does the same thing and she's considered Y, and that's hypocritical.

But are there any double standards between men and women that *should* exist in your opinion? Like someone brings up a certain double standard in an argument, and you go, you're correct, that double standard does indeed exist, and that's good - because it *should* exist.",1

On Sex Work [and other things],"So, I want to know your opinion on some thoughts that I have:

1\] Say, even if we remove the stigma of the sex work, porn, or onlyfans, we cannot eliminate the physical realities of the act itself. That is, if we remove moral and social judgement, and ensure the safety of the workers, you still have two groups of people : women who engaged in such activities, and those who did not. What to make of the information would be at the personal discretion of them and their partners, but my point is that two groups will exist.

2\] Expanding on the idea of physical realities - When it comes to women being obese, or not wearing make up, or not trimming body hair, I think there are two separate issues here. The first issue is that no woman should be treated badly because they are obese, or refuse to wear makeup, or do not trim their body hair. Nor should they be forced or expected to wear makeup and trim their body hair - which is fair, and that is the way things should be. The second issue is that relationships operate as a free market. So you have to realize that your position there depends on your attributes -being overweight, not wearing makeup, or not trimming your body hair might affect your chances to attract a partner \[Again, this is true for men too, with different attributes, but no movements are based around men being fat, and nobody cares about fat men while fat women are put on covers of magazines\]. So these two are very different issues, and while

3\] Isn't porn lucrative for women BECAUSE of the side-effects that it has?  I mean, if there is no stigma and no bad effects, and if any woman can work in porn without having to face any kind of repercussions - personal or professional \[so easy entry\], economics dictates that it would become significantly less lucrative to work in porn. I have already heard that onlyfans is not as lucrative today as it was a couple of years ago \[the median earning as of today is $136/month\]. If you recall the porn from the 1980's/90's and compare it to what passes as 'vanilla' porn today you would see that the latter is more 'violent' and 'problematic' and the women probably paid much less than they were then, plus you have a lot of competition. Also, there is money in sex work because it is restricted. If you legalize it, it would become significantly less lucrative. because you will have a proliferation of women who want to earn extra money on the side as compared to highly vulnerable women \[like the ones who currently do sex work\] which will be blindsided.  Think about the Bella Thorne - Onlyfans incident, where she earned a lot of money. If other popular actresses also open an onlyfans account, what would happen to the average woman on onlyfans? Why would people subsribe to her when at the same price I can see the content of a famous model / actress?

4\] Leading up to this - I think that if there were a scenario were sex work, porn, and onlyfans was not stigmatized, and it was like any other profession, it would lead to more brutal hierarchies on a much basic level - like looks and race \[things you cannot change\] and lead to some weird type of progress that cannot be determined at this point. That is, what proportion of women do you think can make a decent living out of this profession? What would be the median salary be like? In most other disciplines, you can work hard, study for an advance degree, or get ahead due to experience. Due to nature of adult work, the only way \[that I see\] to increase your profit is to go towards more 'extreme' ways of sex - like just notice how commonplace anal porn is today as compared to 10 years ago.

Coming to the point about race, consider interracial relationships. There are obviously more interracial relationships today than 10 years ago - which you might consider progress. But most of them are between Black Men and White Women, and very few Black Women and White Men. Okay, maybe we can attribute it to say Black Men being well represented in sports \[American Sports\], the music industry, and let's also include shallow women who might date them because of them being perceived as well endowed \[due to porn\]. Even accounting for all this, I think the ratio is very skewed. In media, I hardly see any Black Woman \[Non-Black Man\] pairings. Even in porn, where you might see every possible thing imaginable, Interracial porn is mainly between Black Men and White Women. Also, Even amongst Black Men, only a very small percentage have the privilege of being good at sports, music, well endowed, the other Black Men who do not have such privileges are probably going to grow more resentful over time \[if they already aren't \].

My point here is, on the surface it seems like progress is happening, but it is leading to more intra-group issues with a potential towards increasing tension within groups, based on things that cannot be changed \[face, height, musical talent\]. Like Black Men getting involved in majority of the interracial relationships, Attractive women earning the most money on onlyfans. Though women have sexual autonomy today, There also exists groups like femcels who are women which have no partners  \[around 30k members on reddit\], and I think the problem of invisible women \[the idea that women who are not attractive are non-existent\] has become more prevalent today.

In the end I don't think there is a way to truly demolish hierarchies - you demolish one, and new ones will be born. This can be attributed to the fact that human beings have very complex desires compared to other species. You think about other animals and they are so happy with basic food and shelter. My opinion is that at best feminism will be able to remove problematic behaviors like catcalling, objectification, workplace discrimination, and non violent sexual assault / harassment, but beyond that it is just unfathomable what the side effects of the other progresses would be - or even if those progresses can be long lasting, since I consider feminism a privilege of the economically prosperous nation. With changes in economy, environmental degradation, changes in the nature of war, this progress might roll back. ",1

AI and (species?) discrimination.,"I see some posts here about getting women into non-high paying fields like plumbing and welding. What are your thoughts on machines replacing humans in the future in these fields \[which is very much possible not too long from now\]? They do not present any of the problems that feminists are addressing today. A non human work environment seems like the most ideal one - it is devoid of sexual harassment and workers needing days off, at the least. For instance, we had sexual assault issues with uber drivers - it will be solved with a non human driver, but uber's main goal has always been self driving cars as cabs and transport logistics. There are just waiting it out until the technology becomes more safer and economically viable, which Tesla has taken major strides in.

One argument might be that maybe humans will pivot to tech careers. To which I want to comment that not everyone has the capacity, drive, and temperament to survive in tech. Also, being a software developer is radically different from working in a PURE Machine Learning / AI role.

Also, why are feminists focusing on getting more women in tech? As someone who was born to significantly well off parents and who has a high salary, there is no correlation between a high paying career and your happiness / fulfilment in life, which is why I think there are is lesser women in tech in countries with high GDP/Capita like Sweden. I don't mention careers like Medicine / Law / Business because you cannot make a 6 figure salary in your early 20's in those professions \[so the women in those professions are highly committed and have thought things through\] and need to get grad degrees to get top salary, whereas in tech you can get a decent salary even after attending some bootcamp. Moreover, it seems like you want companies to force men to take parental leaves too. Why don't feminists want to encourage more women to not have children, and encourage more women to have casual sex relationships? Wouldn't that be more liberating than women becoming mothers and basically companies or worse, taxpayers paying couples to have babies and at the same time restricting young men from doing extra work / overtime? Again you might say that ""well, a woman might work for less hours but she might do better quality work"" to which I say ""Surely, there must exist at least one man with the capacity to work more hours without compromising on quality""?",1

Would a sociologically (and biologically) focused sex Ed classes help solve the sexist issues that hinder dating?,"Sex Ed should include teaching young people about consent, contraception (not just abstinence), male and female puberty. That‚Äôs what I learned and I believe I have a pretty comprehensive knowledge of the biological aspects based on that. 
However I believe a more sociological aspect also needs to be taught; how to conduct yourself around someone your sexually attracted to, how women and men differ,  how women and men are similar, that women enjoy sex too, and how people‚Äôs preferences in a partners differ (In features, sexuality and gender identity) etc. 

(Issues particularly in heterosexual relationships) I‚Äôve noticed, lurking on ‚Äúdating advice‚Äù spaces there are very many men who believe all women are the same; having the same preferences and believing women have it easier in dating. I think these are harmful, sexist opinions that stem from a serious misunderstanding of Sex and relationships. 
There are men who truly believe *all* women want is a 6‚Äù rich guy, disregarding the fact women are people: being taught that sex is something he does to a women not with a women. Assuming dating for women is easier simply because they are women. 

My questions for fellow feminists are; 

- is dating conduct something we should be teaching in schools along side Sex Ed? 

- have you noticed any other examples of sexism in dating? 

- are there any issues with how women conduct themselves in dating? 

- will a sociological aspect make sex Ed more LGBTQ+ inclusive? 

- What important things can be taught to make sex Ed more inclusive and less sexist?",1

Have supportive friends or partners in chat, to talk with and help mod

Different games have different sets of viewers, so if possible try to find one that's less toxic.

making sure to take breaks and rests

While youtube and twitch have their official processes for dealing with harassment , reporting moderating censorship, muting, banning people

Feel free to reply on how you deal either in it general or individual issues I‚Äôve listed bellow

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Fake donations. Men who demanded my attention in chat and make me feel guilty about not replying or reading immediately.

Lack of communication or chat interaction without face cam. Insults on looks when I do have face cam.

One my biggest issues is that I don't get taken seriously, also I'm not traditionally attractive. Like I enjoy wearing low cut tops, like even when I'm not streaming. Like I try really fucking hard but this is difficult because of my mental health.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Not taken seriously, sexism, etc pretty much from the get-go. There are people on Twitch dedicated to harassing female streamers.

My successes are attributed to my gender instead of my hard work and talent

. A handful of loyal viewers who feel the need to defend or carry me, because I‚Äôm viewed as fragile and not \*as\* smart as males. Like it‚Äôs ‚Äúcute‚Äù that I play some video games.

Thanks for this post and I think that perhaps younger women, or those who don‚Äôt have a very large following (or those who are ignorant) may be in denial about how the female experience differs to the male experience. There is a lot of unlearning to do.

People commenting negatively on my appearance- makeup, clothing etc. When it has nothing to do with my content at all. I don't do fashion, beauty, lifestyle etc. It's irrelevant. I'm sure most creators experience this at some point though, not just females

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

there is an element of ""why would i take advice from a female who can't even get her makeup/hair/outfit right"" that does seem mainly reserved for female creators. And getting the opposite ""you're so pretty you deserve more subs"" isn't less offensive.

Just scroll through comments of male creators vs females - and count how many comments relate to appearance vs content. The proportions are wildly different - even when the genre is unrelated..

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

All you see in my videos is an angle from above of a piano keyboard, my hands playing the said keyboard, and my legs underneath. The amount of times I get comments about my legs is ridiculous... ""cover them up, I can't concentrate"" and the like. I've had marriage proposals because ""your hands are beautiful, imagine what else you can do with them"" etc etc. It's a good thing I don't show my face... can't imagine how much worse things would be ???? I don't get too much harassment specifically for being female though I do get the odd ""it would sound so much better if a guy played this music"" ?

"What is your response to men who claim doing sex work is harmful to oneself and others, among other criticisms?","I had an interesting debate the other day with someone who said along the lines of:

- What if the sex worker has children, and the children find out their parent was a sex worker?

They said that the children would probably feel ashamed/embarrassed. Therefore, it‚Äôs wrong.

- How would *you* feel if you found out your parent was a sex worker?

I said in response it doesn‚Äôt matter how I feel about what they do, (I would admittedly feel embarrassed) I respect their choice in bodily autonomy. Who am I to tell what job someone should have?

Then, this was not part of the debate but I thought of it: 

- They brought up that sex workers/nude models have a hard time dating because of their line of work.

- Would I date a sex worker? 

I watch pornography, but I most likely would not date a pornstar out of insecurity/jealousy. Am I a hypocrite?

I notice something too, how many men will shame women for having an Onlyfans (‚Äúit‚Äôs not a real job‚Äù, ‚Äúthey are making money off of simps‚Äù, ‚Äúthese women are selling their body‚Äù) yet they will still masturbate to it.

Should we try to eradicate preferences that are rooted in sexism?,"Not a regular in this sub, but I assume that there's a lot of threads asking about whether a preference (especially when it comes to attraction) is rooted in sexism.

A classic example would be that in cishet culture, height is a heavy factor when it comes to being attractive. Men typically prefer women shorter than them, and women prefer men taller than them. For some, it's even a deal-breaker. We can trace this back to the patriarchal notion that men have to be strong, protective, and dominant, while women have to be small, weak, and submissive.

Most feminists I've asked about this in real life have more or less said the same thing: 

""Yes, they are at least partly rooted in sexist notions, but everyone is entitled to their preferences. What's important is that we acknowledge that our individual preferences may be influenced by cultural factors and don't look down on those we don't find attractive.""

Personally, I agree with this conclusion.

However, one friend told me her opinion that really intrigued me. She said that we have to try to unlearn these preferences, especially if we acknowledge that they are caused (or at least influenced) by patriarchy. Because by respecting and accepting these preferences, we are also respecting, normalizing, and further perpetuating these harmful patriarchal notions which make them even harder to combat in the long run. 

I responded by saying that we can't blame individuals for being affected by the system. We need to go after the system itself.

She responded by saying that these are not mutually exclusive. These are still symptoms of patriarchy that we must also combat, the same way with how we fight ""petty"" sexist jokes while also demanding equal pay.

I'm curious what other feminists think about her opinion!",1
Wage gap question,"I have a real question but i dont want to trigger anyone. You have to understand i started my career right out of highschool in a blue collar 99% male profession. I'm not saying anyone is right/wrong or good/bad, i just want to catch some takes on the following completely hypothetical situation.

Jack and Jill are a married couple who got laid off. They can't find work in their field and the only option they have is roofing. Both have no experience in roofing and get hired by a contractor. The contractor starts Jack off at $20/hr, and Jill off at $15/hr because he believes Jack is stronger and can do more work. This is obviously discrimination... 

Now lets say both Jack and Jill start off at $18/hr. After 1 month it's been determined that Jack can finish and entire roof in 1 day, while the same roof for Jill takes her 2 days. Would it be fair to give Jack a raise to $36/hr, but no raise to Jill because they are both being paid at the at same rate (roofs completed per day)?

If this is discrimination how is it rectified? Should Jack be told to slow down and take more cigarette breaks? Should they be paid the same base salary and incentivized a commission or bonus based on how many roofs they can complete to everyone to keep moving?",1

"From a feminist perspective, how important is sex to everyday life/quality of life?","Assuming that you aren't an asexual you'd generally desire sex. And the amount you'd want to have varies from person to person. So, with that in mind, how important is it really? A point often posted here is ""no one dies from lack of sex"". which is true buuut when you look at subs like the dead bedrooms and such you'll see that a lot of people feel VERY hurt by a partner that is not physically affectionate with them. And while it does not merit outrage being rejected sexually can hurt especially if it's a repeated experience. some experience days, weeks, months, or for some years of not feeling that desire and affection from others. At least not from anyone they'd welcome it from. 

Yeah there are more important things. But that can be said about a lot of things. It's all relative. So relatively speaking how important is sexual attention, affection, reciprocation and such? Considering that you don't need it to live, would the lack of it coupled with the feeling that no one will ever desire you in such a way have any actual harmful effects? IS it at all important? Or could you be expected to die a virgin who desires sex and shouldnt be bothered by it?",1

"gender norms are bad, but why do the tall, strong men get all the women?","serious question. when asked why women love tall men they say that they feel protected and so on, but that's just enforcing gender norms, no?",1
Discussion: not conforming to gender norms seems more stigmatized than conforming?,"The portrayal of a ‚Äòpick me‚Äô usually tends to be women shunning traditionally feminine things.  While negative stereotypes exist about women who love femininity, it seems less stigmatized in that it‚Äôs considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or even favorable.  Same goes for men involved in traditionally masculine things.  

As a basic example, traditionally ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù or ‚Äúgothic‚Äù things are stigmatized moreso than women loving fashion and makeup or men (or even women, given the overall favoring of masculine things) loving sports. By stigma, I mean in the sense of being ‚Äúodd,‚Äù ‚Äúweird,‚Äù or just ‚Äúdeviant‚Äù from the norm.  Media itself perpetuates these kind of stigmas, and perhaps there is more to such stigmas in addition to not fitting gender norms? 

Men conforming to masculinity and women conforming to femininity seem to gain a certain power and social status, and in many settings can practice judgement against people of all genders who may be ‚Äúnerdy,‚Äù ‚Äúgothic,‚Äù etc.  I think the gamer girls who develop the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like other girls‚Äù resentment also come from having faced ostracization from feminine girls and more acceptance among fellow ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù guys (not justifying by any means).  

This is a discussion in that I‚Äôm sharing based on my observations and would love to hear others‚Äô observations and experiences.  Maybe there are also differences in what‚Äôs more stigmatized by environments and age groups?

Disclaimer 1: I apologize for any cisnormative language.  I‚Äôd love to hear perspectives from trans/non-binary folk.  

Disclaimer 2: If it‚Äôs relavant, I‚Äôm a cis woman, and I practice femininity to a small extent (on occasion).",1

"Why is sexist jokes towards men fine in feminist circle, but not the reverse?","Often times, I see feminists taking sexist jokes directed towards women seriously. And will then say that 'jokes are supposed to be funny'. Which they do have a point on that. But just look at feminists dismissing Clementine's sexist jokes as 'not a big deal' and bc she 'apologized'. Ur apology isnt sincere and doesnt mean much when you keep on repeating the same 'mistake' over and over again, and that you're known for that very thing. And other feminists argument against not doing anything about misandristic jokea? Women are dying, they say. Yeah, but a MUCH bigger of men are dying tho.

But then, these same feminists make sexist jokes about men. And when men react, we're dismissed as ""fragile men"", male tears, and the like. That they often call us privileged white men (I didnt know not agreeing with a sexist joke made me white. Interesting.)

Why is it that sexist jokes towards men is fine, but not the reverse, in feminists circle?

"Pro-prostitution feminists, how do you want to end the commodification of women?","Hello everyone!

I have only recently started to study the views of feminists. One thing I really like about it, is that feminism strives to end the commodification of women. As far as I am concerned, standing against prostitution - like anti-prostitution feminists do - and other kind of sex workers, could, in my opinion, help the situation. But so far I don't know how pro-prostitution feminists think that this problem could be tackled. I mean, people who engage in such activities (either by being a sex worker or paying for the service), greatly contribute to this phenomena.

So with this in mind, my question would be, what measures would you want to be taken and by whom to end/decrease the  commodification of women, if you support any type of sex work (be it prostitution, OnlyFans or whatever)?",1

What's your opinion of difference feminism?,"Hi :)

I'm doing A-level politics and we're studying Feminism as one of our ideologies, so any replies to this would help me understand it better :) 

We've briefly skipped over difference feminism and what it is, but it's generally overlooked because, as the textbook stresses, its ""extremely controversial among other feminist groups"" and difference feminists are only a minority. 

Although I wouldn't necessarily agree with it, it doesn't seem too extreme (as I would argue separatism is, though we skipped over that as well) or particularly controversial to disregard it completely. I feel like the exam board are being very careful about the content they include to not portray feminism as an anti-men movement, so really emphasise equality feminism.

Is difference feminism as controversial and a small a minority as the exam board/textbooks are saying? What's your opinion on it, are you a difference feminist?

Thanks very much, any replies would be much appreciated :)",1

How has slut-shaming and the way society frames women and sex poorly effected your sex life?,"The internet is, even at the best of times, a cesspit of misogyny and slut-shaming. Full to the brim with ‚Äúscientific facts‚Äù used to shame women for having sex, eg;

- multiple sexual partners stretch the vagina (but the same amount of sex with one person doesn‚Äôt have the same effect) 

-women who have had sex with more than two partners are more likely to get divorced.

Along with these, a plethora of misconceptions and hypocrisies regarding how men and women differ sexually‚Äî *men enjoy sex while women are meant to make sex enjoyable for men‚Äî women must be virginal and innocent but they must also be good at it and know how to please ‚Äúher man‚Äù, men on the other hand can be selfish in sex and have had many sexual partners.* 

Even off the internet people are so quick to slut shame someone simply because they don‚Äôt like that person, or a loose rumour.

**My personal experience, and how this has severely effected my sex life:**

I was fairly late losing my virginity (19) *in comparison to my friends* , the day after I lost it to the guy I thought would be my first real boyfriend, he broke things off over text and ghosted me. He was keen to ‚Äúplay the field‚Äù. 
The next time I had sex was a one night stand that turned into a relationship with whom I later found out to be a serial cheater. Many people called me a slut behind my back for this. He was a narcissist and very selfish in sex, but I didn‚Äôt know better. I finally ended things with him and went on to have several drunken ‚Äúone night stands‚Äù with guys I was/ am friends with in the years since. 
I‚Äôm now in my mid twenties and consider myself extremely inexperienced; I‚Äôve never really enjoyed sex, haven‚Äôt had sex sober in years out of shame and get very uncomfortable when anyone talks about it. And yet because I‚Äôve had more than 15 sexual partners I‚Äôm considered an unmarryable ‚Äúslut‚Äù by the standards of men online. As you can imagine this is rather confusing and damaging. 

This is just my personal experience and I‚Äôm dealing with it how I see fit. 

**So my questions are**

- has slut-shaming and misogyny effected your sex life? What‚Äôs your story? 

- how can we change things? Does the fault lie in sex Ed?",1

"I generally accept that men and women have roughly equal sexual appetites of 'libidos'.

Surely its not because of the wage or wealth gap, most pornography these days is free, and as for prostitution, the EXTREME discrepancy is female prostitutes catering men and male prostitutes catering to women doesn't seem to be explainable by any sort of economic inability for women to afford a male prostitute. Is it a power thing, men sort of subconsciously objectifying women in a way that women don't generally do to men? In a society that regarded men and women as truly equal, would prostitution die out or be highly diminished, including prostitution where the woman is doing so voluntarily? The same question for pornography. 

Is it not a power thing but something else?",1

GF used to be a willing side chick,"The relationship dynamic was one of objectification. The married guy objectified her and she liked it basically. His friends knew about this dynamic and they both got off on it when they hung out with them. The sex life was of the similar tone (him being really dominant and her doing whatever he asked of her). GF says she still likes being objectified and they broke off the hookup because of his marriage not because of how the relationship was structured. I've explained to her how getting off on objectification could be pretty dangerous for her psyche and she agrees, but the pleasure aspect is still there.

Not that it changes much but I've been with quite a few people who've been with quite a few people and it has never bothered me. No matter how graphic they were in describing their sex life.

This one got to me though. I'd like to consider myself a feminist (not a good one apparently) and want to get past this. One the one hand unlike some feminists I think there's actually an immoral aspect to her behavior. Namely that she has been immoral to herself in rejecting her humanity (by objectifying herself willingly). Of course there are societal factors as to why she's in the predicament she's in, but at the end of the day I believe that we can still choose freely (with bigger or smaller inclinations).

Honestly I don't care about him, this is not about jealousy as much as it is about her pleasure derived from objectification in that relationship bothering me.

I'd like to get a grip of this issue and would like to hear some possible arguments as to why I shouldn't consider it a big deal. I'm really posting this to change my mind.

Feeling a sense of failure after being sexually assaulted,"I went home alone on my city‚Äôs public transit system recently after having dinner with a friend. A man got on my train and immediately began to sexually harass me. It turned into assault when I tried to move away from him. Being in a moving train car felt like being trapped in a cage with him. It was awful. It felt like an eternity before we reached the next station. I bolted from the train and the station as quickly as possible. Then I stood outside crying until I was calm enough to go back into the station and report the incident.

I knew they would have security camera footage, but even so, I felt unhelpful. The police asked me if I knew what time the incident began. I did not know exactly. They asked for a physical description, but he had been wearing a face mask and I avoided eye contact with him. They asked if I knew what specific train/train car number I had been on. I didn‚Äôt know. They asked if I had taken a picture of him. I had not.

Are most people in these situations really calm, collected and bold enough to gather all of this information while attempting to remain as safe as possible? Am I just really bad at this? I almost didn‚Äôt even go back and report it. I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it or be involved in a potential legal case, and I didn‚Äôt feel like I had enough solid information. I feel like I panicked and failed. When I was sexually assaulted in my early 20s, I felt guilty for a long time because I felt I should have been able to prevent it.

Gendering of Certain Products for Men,"Question (explanation will follow):
Is the gendering of products like makeup/face soaps/etc for men (i.e. calling it Scooter McShooterface's Guy Liner for men) a product of toxic masculinity/fragile guy egos or is someone who leans towards buying ""for men"" products showing toxic masculinity. This being a really positive sub who can explain things, I was hoping yall could weigh in. 

Background:
I was on Twitter and saw the debate about gendered products (it was makeup for men). Most of the sides were saying that these products need not be gendered and gendering them is catering to fragile masculinity.

Now as someone who buys a lot of nice soaps/deodorants/etc i had a question or caveat to this i find the ""for men"" label helps. It tells me that the product has a better chance of working for my skin/being more effective. Some gender neutral products/ones that aren't excitedly made for men are not as effective on my skin from a moisturizing point or do a bad job of making me feel clean/stop B.O. knowing this i wonder if it is toxic or fragile to prefer that a product is gendered b/c it tells me about the product in two words.

What and who are AryanRadFemsUnity/Aryan Action Against Pornography and are they connected to radical feminism like they claim?,"Hello, i was browsing gab, which is this weird far right twitter clone for old people and racists, just looking and laughing at all the man trump supporters claiming that trump has won and will be still in power, etc

When i came upon a two groups, one called ""Aryan Action Against Pornography"" and another one called  ""Aryan Rad Fems Unity"". I wont link them here as i do not want to give them publicity and i am not sure the rules on it. 

The Aryan Rad Fems Unity group claims to be a group of ""radical feminists"" based in US and Canada. The group has a lot of transphobic posts, mostly memes, and celebrated some law in the uk stopping transgender stuff for under 18's. They mostly target sex workers and the porn industry however. 

The posts of these groups are pretty racist, homophobic and transphobic. They both post about how porn is  apparently turning children LGBT (often calling homosexuals and trans people slurs) and how it normalises ""interracial rape"" to children, other posts talk about mass doxing of both porn watchers and performers and calls for ""punishments"" to those people. Seems like both group are pretty small but are armed with some guns and have ""connections within"" the RMCP as one post is a member posing next to a RCMP suv with an AK rifle. Both groups have posts that have nazi symbolism in them. 

I could not find anything else on them.

The ""Aryan rad fem unity"" account seems related to the whole Exdous Cry group, since they have photos of members wearing a t shirt from that ""trafficking hub"" thing. The daily beast exposed the group behind that campaign of being related to a radical religious sect in that is fiercely anti-abortion, anti-LGBT and anti-sex work. They helped put money into an anti-LGBT law in Kenya as someone pointed out on twitter. Someone who i talked to about this last night said that the group was probably some christian extremists like the army of god that targeted and killed abortion doctors.

"Is it wrong to portray women in idealized, sexual ways?","Yesterday there was a pretty popular thread on r/Art with a painting of an Asian girl in her bra drinking her morning coffee. It was a very good painting in terms of technical skill but the subject matter seemed to revolt some people. They started pointing out details like they wouldn't wear a push-up bra in the morning and stuff like that. One redditor called it a ""male gaze"", which I didn't even know what it was at the time but she defined it in a later comment as a ""made for the viewing pleasure of heterosexual males"" and went ahead to point out that real-life women don't look like that. I'll go ahead and post my response:


&gt;Art would be boring if it was all realistic. Have you noticed how in Da Vinci's Last Supper painting, everyone sits on one side of the table, even though it would be a lot more convenient to use both sides? Da Vinci painted an idealized version where all the disciples are displayed in a row so that they will all be visible to the viewer. It's illogical from a pragmatic standpoint but it makes the painting better.

&gt;In the same vein, I don't think there's anything wrong with an exaggerated, illogical and vaguely sexual depiction of a girl drinking coffee, just as I don't find anything wrong with a statue of naked muscle-hunk Hercules chocking Cerberus and saying ""I am tough and good in bed""


She responded that this sexualized depiction of women causes misogynistic attitudes and human trafficking. I'll be honest, I didn't understand that at all. Why is it that the sexual depiction of women immediately alludes to rape and sex trafficking? Cannot women just be flirty and promiscuous because they want to? Why is it that if I draw an unrealistically handsome guy with a seductive gaze, he is just a seductive guy, whereas if I draw an idealized seductive girl, she is a dehumanized sex object. I see no reason to attach such a dark context to a painting.


As for it being unrealistic, yes it is, but maybe that's not such a crime. A realistic depiction of a man in the morning would be with tousled hair, eye boogers and drool. Will women develop unrealistic standards if they keep seeing male Calvin Klein models who supposedly just woke up but they look like they just exited a makeup studio? I don't think people are that stupid, both men and women can tell apart reality from fantasy. If you watch Game of Thrones you won't be attracted to dragon-slaying men only, if you watch superhero films you won't be attracted to superheroes only and if you watch anime you won't be attracted to big-eyed people only.


What are your thoughts? My post got a little ranty but I'm not trying to be patronizing or change your views on anything, I just want to see what I've been missing.

How prevalent was anti-feminism during the early days of feminism?,"Nowadays, you'll often hear people say that feminism used to be good, but now it's gone too far, that we used to want equality, but now we want to have more power than men. The thing is...haven't people always been saying this? Am I mistaken, or have been accusing feminists of wanting supremacy since the early days of the movement?

What was the general public perception of feminism like in the past, and how has it changed in the modern day, if it has at all?",1
Cheaters Websites,"I‚Äôve recently discovered my husbands ex girlfriend (allegedly) created 23 different posts on about 9 different ‚Äúcheaters‚Äù websites. Everything she‚Äôs said is false. All the posts have my name and the city where I‚Äôm from. There are two different photos of me on some of the posts.

I had no idea these websites existed until I stumbled upon them when I googled myself. There are 1000s of people who are doxxed on there and the poster can say whatever they want, anonymously, without any legal repercussions (that I‚Äôm aware of). 

I was just wondering if any of you have had an experience of being doxxed on one of these websites, and if there is anything that can be done to take them down and hold the poster accountable.

Update: I just got a quote from a lawyer. 

‚ÄúPricing starts at $1,500 for one post and goes up depending on which sites you are on and how many posts you have. Based on the number of posts you provided, you are probably looking at a cost somewhere between $6,000-$9,000.‚Äù

So... I won‚Äôt be getting a lawyer. I figured that would happen but I wanted to see what my options were.

How to handle media that seems to objectify women?,"I'm still learning how to articulate my thoughts on this so please share your perspectives!

I noticed I get annoyed or triggered when I see commercials, movies, or shows that sexualize woman (ie: a seemingly wholesome anime movie, then suddenly random gratuitous panty shots up a girl's skirt; random women in bikinis just sitting on the side while the buff men move the plot forward in a cheesey action film; or when someone blatantly threatens to rape a woman). 

I'm bothered how pervasive it is in media and I don't want to feel so resentful about it. People tell me, ""then don't watch it."" But I can't just avoid media, because it's like I'm turning a blind eye and not addressing my gripes with it. I want to know how to change my .. mindset I guess? I want to not be so annoyed, or respond more calmly, or learn new ways to view the situation.

Should I (24M) eventually confess the worst thing I've done to any prospective partners?,"I'm currently single, and I've done some things about which I have great guilt. They may be considered criminal, but no one involved seems to care, and it's not like I'm expecting to ever have the police at my door because of these things.

Should I still tell any future partners about these things? I'm especially concerned that any of my partners should be provided with full transparency about who their sleeping with, so as not to deceive them into sex or a relationship (it just feels rapey). This may just be my anxiety talking, so feel free, anyone, to tell me so.

TL;DR! I've done some terrible things, but I'm not expecting any real consequences from them, and don't want to deceive any future partners into sex or relationships by not confessing these things.

EDIT: Thank you all for this input! I think the general idea is simple enough: if, in theory, my partner were to somehow learn about something I did and be put off by it, then I should disclose it at an appropriate time, no matter how slim a chance there may be. The reason being that healthy relationships are based on the ability to be honest and thus vulnerable about the good and bad parts of yourself with the other person.

Who is responsible Commercialization and Commodification of Women,"Women showing off their sexuality of their own volition and profiting from it if they wish is a sign of feminine empowerment, not objectification. 

That said, I definitely understand where many are coming from. Sexualization of women in contexts where it doesn‚Äôt really have anything to do with the main content is typically just disingenuous eye candy, lazy marketing designed to attract impulse buyers who only need to see a pretty face to get interested.

It‚Äôs rather complicated, because those women are excercising their right to profit off their sexuality, and those customers are buying exactly what those women are offering. They aren‚Äôt being exploited or coerced into giving more.

But then this perpetuates the mentality that women ARE commodities, which may lead those men to hurt real women who AREN‚ÄôT interested in selling their sexuality. But who‚Äôs responsibility is it to fix this? Capitalism? The Government? Women? Men?",1
What do you think about pre-college single-sex schools?,"I am a student who has studied in private all boys schools since elementary school. I am now a high school senior.

On the one hand, comparing to what I hear from my cousin and friends, there are no ""drama"" in an all boys' school. Gossips are really rare and there are no who's dating who going on at all. We also feel completely comfortable participating in activities having a traditionally skewed gender ratio, for example, I am very proud of being a member of the school's choir, while my friend in a co-ed school says they have real trouble recruiting boys into mixed choirs.

On the other hand, we lack the opportunity to learn what boundaries are, especially when it comes to interacting with the opposite sex. On rare occasions where the school organize activities with a sister school, most of us just sit together among ourselves and do not actively try to make new friends from the other school (same for the girls) as communication often becomes awkward and nervous. Another thing I notice is among us boys, when we know no female can hear us, we would laugh on sex and porn jokes that would probably make women offended or uncomfortable.

Why is sexual assault depicted in so many TV shows/Movies?,"I want to preface this by admitting that I am heavily triggered by topics surrounding sexual assault and harassment so I may just be overestimating but at least four of the shows I‚Äôve tried to watch have depicted SA in some way. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I literally feel the need to google search a show‚Äôs name and put ‚Äúrape‚Äù after it to see what comes up.

I think I‚Äôd feel so much differently about this if these depictions were done in ways that were focused on the survivor and their journey navigating the aftermath of the assault (I think the show ‚ÄúI May Destroy You‚Äù by Michaela Coel did a pretty good job at this). But often it feels like the scenes are just a way to advance the plot, show how ‚Äúevil‚Äù someone or something is and/or a way to add ‚Äúdepth‚Äù or backstory to a female character. 

While I recognize that depictions of sexual assault in media can start very necessary conversations about rape culture and how to recognize it, I feel like a lot of the shows I see are not doing it for that purpose. Am I being too critical?",1
"Please help me understand emotional labor, I think my thoughts are misogynistic","I've been reading about women's emotional labor and I can't stop thinking that the problem is being incompatible. I realize that there is definitely an imbalance due to socializing which is sexist but if you can't find a solution that works for everyone and your partner doesn't care about your feelings, then that just sounds like a bad relationship to me. So I understand that the cause is sexist and harmful but I don't see how and why it's so difficult to resolve if your partner is not awful. 
I'm a woman who is terrible at and disinterested in household stuff. Fortunately, my partner loves to cook and decorate so he does all of that. We take turns with every other chore.

"Can one be a feminist if they don't ever use the term ""Latinx""?","This kind of irks at me inside because I just can't get comfortable with the term. Largely due to that I don't know a single person who identifies with it, but do know multiple Latino/a people who consider the term at best silly and eye-rollworthy and at worse offensive. It's also unpronouncable in Spanish and it feels uncomfortable to effectively tell Spanish speakers ""Your language is so dated and patriarchial, let us Anglophones tell you how to update it..."", this wouldn't be so much of an issue if most or at least a significant minority of Spanish speakers were open to the term, but every poll has shown that at most like 2-3% of Latinos in the US identify with it. I simply am not comfortable using the word especially when discussing demographic makeups which I do regularly discussing political geography (like saying a certain county is ""X% Latinx"" instead of ""X% Latino"" which is the standard.

I don't have as much antipathy toward it as I do the term ""womxn"" which I actually find flat out offensive and will always call out if I see it used on Twitter or whatnot, but it's not a word I can ever see myself using, though I still consider myself very progressive and feminist.

"Are these articles right or wrong in their claims, and if wrong, can you explain why that is?","As a woman, I don't understand why twitter is full of women talking about ""women naturally desiring strong men"" followed by bashing on ""feminine"" men?: [https://twitter.com/BritMartinez/status/1345522717789978626](https://twitter.com/BritMartinez/status/1345522717789978626)

The article linked sounds more off-putting to me: [https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/feminization-men-cheats-women-natural-desire-to-admire-strong-men/?fbclid=IwAR2popTJ9BBAiWkL8FNfLMjc81fMPQFnTFoBVgfYokrIHeGJ5LmaNs8MDto](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/feminization-men-cheats-women-natural-desire-to-admire-strong-men/?fbclid=IwAR2popTJ9BBAiWkL8FNfLMjc81fMPQFnTFoBVgfYokrIHeGJ5LmaNs8MDto)

In summary, the article mentions the Yin and Yang, claiming that women are innately ""feminine"", and men innately ""masculine"", that the ""feminine"" (woman) naturally desires and needs the ""masculine"" (man) to be complete (for ""femininity/womanhood"" to be fulfilled) just as much as the ""masculine"" (man) naturally desires and needs the ""feminine"" (woman) to be complete (for ""masculinity/manhood"" to be fulfilled)

""One can‚Äôt fulfill itself without the other"" it says. Indeed the Yin and Yang claims that all things exist as inseparable and contradictory opposites, which I'm guessing leads to the belief that: ""women are innately feminine, men are innately masculine, men can not be feminine, and women can not be masculine, or that would defy nature. And men (masculine) can not love or be in relationships with men (masculine), and women (feminine) can not love or be in relationships with women (feminine), because only the polar opposites can fulfill and complete each other, masculine (man) can not complement and complete the masculine (man), and feminine (woman) can not complement and complete the feminine (woman)""

&gt;The masculine needs the feminine just as much as the feminine needs the masculine. It‚Äôs an eternal truth as old as the concept of Yin and Yang itself. Tragically, today, we‚Äôre witnessing the extensive snuffing out of the masculine in our society. The Yang is being suppressed. When the modern feminists proclaim that gender is just a made-up ‚Äúconstruct,‚Äù understand that they‚Äôre essentially belittling the eons of human experience. The masculine-feminine duality isn‚Äôt a tool that the patriarchy uses to oppress women, despite what these anti-gender-roles activists allege. Rather, it‚Äôs an everlasting concept present in all of mankind, whether it be Eastern or Western or Native traditions.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Yin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity, and night time. Yang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity, and daytime. One can‚Äôt overrule the other. Womanhood and manhood have to work in tandem. It‚Äôs a symbol of the continuity of life itself.¬†

It links to another article when it reaches ""have to work in tandem"": [https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/men-and-women-are-complementary-this-benefits-couples-and-their-children/](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/men-and-women-are-complementary-this-benefits-couples-and-their-children/)

&gt;Men and women are unique beings created to complement each other. Biological differences enable men and women to live in love and harmony, forming a beautiful whole when they come together.

The rest is bashing ""feminine"" men, and saying that ""femininity"" comes with ""irrationality"" so men shouldn't be ""feminized"" because if they were to be so, they would become ""irrational"", basing their decisions on emotions ...

I'm not well-versed in these subjects, and thought I'd reach out to other women here who might know more.

Do you think those articles are right or wrong? And if they are wrong, can you explain your reasons?

Do you have any arguments against the things said in those articles?

I felt really terrible reading those articles because they sound misogynistic and homophobic? They seem to tell me that as a lesbian I am ""incomplete"" or a failure, because ""woman (feminine) can only be completed by a man (masculine), and vice versa""

I don't know, it's like all the homophobic things I've been told and I feel a bit sick :((",1

"Women with a better-than-average career/salary, are you repelled by men who have a lower social status/less money/a less ""blooming"" career than yourself? Do you always prefer men with an equal/higher social status?","Female hypergamy is sometimes said to be a social norm. The biggest stereotype is ""men are providers"", and ""a man must have his mission"" (you often hear that from dating coach and all sorts of gurus).

Evolutionary psychology sort of says that hypergamy makes sense (females prefer males who can feed their offsprings), but I'm still curious so I come to ask here. It's also important to remember that modern humans are not limited by natural laws (we got out of the food chain, food and shelter are more abundant, etc), so hypergamy should ""go away"" in modern civilization.

In a way, historically, if men had a higher social status than women, hypergamy might be still be correlation, not causation; meaning: an average woman preferring an average man, will mean that the man will still have a higher social status, but social status is not a factor, it's just because of a preexisting distribution of social status between men and women.

It's not a secret that social status and money cannot really determine how two people can be attracted to each other, since it depends on other things: a higher social status might also come from a better education, more love from their parents, a more stable social situation, more nurturing, etc.

When talking about how women are ""catching up"", It's often said that it's easier to automate jobs that are worked in majority by men, compared to job who are in majority worked by women (it's just a theory though).

Make up my own last name?,"Hey everyone. So something that‚Äôs never sat right with me is taking a mans last name. Considering that to him, the idea of taking the woman he loves last name is unfathomable, so why should it be fathomable for me to take his? There‚Äôs a (sorta) simple solution here, and that is to just not take his last name and to keep the one that was given to me at birth, my fathers last name; however, that‚Äôs still a bit unsettling to me lol. 

My father has been emotionally abusive to me ever since I was little, and recently I‚Äôve decided to completely cut him out of my life. He is all things I never want to be‚Äîan abuser, manipulator, narcissist, racists, sexist, homophobic‚Äîeverything bigot. Plus, there‚Äôs not much notability in having my family name in general. The previous generations did not accomplish much and rather just passed on their trauma to the next which ultimately led to me and how I feel about my dad (in other words, they weren‚Äôt/aren‚Äôt great people). Basically, I don‚Äôt feel much honor keeping my dads family last name. 

I‚Äôm a first generation college student about to graduate next year and am going to medical school. The more I think about my dads last name being on my diploma and doctorate degree makes me more and more sick, honestly. I don‚Äôt have any desire bringing honor to a family that has dishonored me so incredibly. For a year, I‚Äôve been thinking about coming up with my own meaningful last name and changing it from my family last name. Has anyone ever done this? Or should I keep my dads last name because it is technically still my last name? The other issue is that since I have been thinking about it for a year, no name I‚Äôve come across has lit the light bulb.

"Thoughts about the gatekeeping of surgical sterilization (tubal ligation, etc.)?","Hi all, I've just been pondering this issue in my head for a few weeks now and I thought I'd bring it here just to see your thoughts.

Most of us have probably heard plenty of accounts from women who have sought out surgical sterilization and been told ""what if your husband someday wants children?"", ""only if you have kids already"", ""only if you're above a certain age"" etc., etc., etc.

It goes without saying that I don't think that's right.

At the same time I realize that, in general (i.e. with regard to *all* procedures, not just sterilization), doctors may feel an ethical responsibility (or maybe have an actual legal, written-in-stone responsibility ... I don't know) to steer patients toward the procedure that is least invasive, and/or which is least restrictive to the patient's future freedom of choice, if there is such an option and it is at least adequate relative to the more invasive/permanent one.

On one hand I do believe the amount of agency a patient has over their body should be maximized, and like the rest of you I believe that this is especially important with regard to reproductive autonomy. I think it's patronizing and disrespectful to act like you know better what a patient wants out of life than they do (unless there is some unusual factor, like the patient is experiencing mental health issues and abruptly starts expressing strong desires that are in contradiction to the ideals they consistently expressed when they were in better health).

A hypothetical: From what I understand, the failure rate of a hormonal IUD (3 in 1000) is about equivalent to the failure rate of tubal ligation (sources I'm reading seem to say between 1 in 1000 to 8 in 1000). Say you're a doctor and you have a patient *with no interfering health issues that would contraindicate a hormonal IUD*, but they come to you and seem to have their mind set on a tubal ligation. They have thought about it for a long time and express complete certainty that they will not want biological children in the future. 

You believe that a hormonal IUD would be just as adequate to serve the patient's purposes as a tubal ligation, and you feel a responsibility to choose the most conservative (as in low-risk, reversible etc.) adequate procedure wherever possible. You tell the patient that a hormonal IUD is about equal in reliability to tubal ligation, and they accept this, but this does not change their mind. The patient tells you that the more permanent procedure *feels* more effective and would grant them peace of mind (I have read accounts from people who desire surgery over an IUD for exactly this reason).

How could a doctor appropriately address this situation?

I understand that tubal ligation is reversible, but this is of course more invasive and I would imagine that, as a surgical procedure done under anaesthesia, it is significantly higher-risk than IUD removal (I don't know if it is, I'm just making an educated guess).

I don't think it's ever right to tell a patient who says they don't want children ""you'll probably change your mind someday"" or ""your husband might want children"" (gross), etc.. At the same time, people *do* change their minds about this unexpectedly for all sorts of reasons, and if a person *does* happen to change their mind, I would imagine that having to undergo the surgical reversal of a sterilization (which, as I understand it, is a complicated procedure you can't guarantee the success of) would cause significantly more distress than an IUD removal. 

In effect, one exercise of reproductive autonomy (in choosing surgical sterilization) poses a threat to the patient's future *ability* to make different choices. At the same time I acknowledge that the future limitation was accepted by the patient at the time of their initial choice, which makes it different from the limitation of choice *imposed* when doctors refuse to perform surgical sterilizations on (mostly women, of course) patients who don't meet X, Y, and Z standards.

How can this be accounted for while, at the same time, maximizing patients' bodily and medical autonomy? You could say that it is ultimately the patient's responsibility to account for the potential consequences of the choice they're making, but I could see where this line of thought could set a dangerous precedent in medical ethics (especially with regard to other elective procedures) unless it was articulated very carefully.

Bear in mind that I don't have much formal knowledge about medical ethics and I don't know what conventions and protocols might already be in place to address this issue.

I haven't come to much of a conclusion in my consideration of this issue, so I'd like to hear your thoughts. Thanks for reading and I hope I've articulated this well.",1

Do you look down on people who are unfazed or even flattered by unsolicited sexual acts from others?,"If you notice a stranger walking up to someone and make lewd comments to them, **but** that person seems to enjoy the attention, do you think ""they must be damaged if they enjoy this attention"", or ""if they enjoyed it then they enjoyed it; to each their own""?

For instance in social environments I've had my ass grabbed as a joke unprompted by friends and acquaintances of both genders (without prior recognition of consent between us), and I have mostly felt either unfazed, flattered or in some cases I even find it funny. One of my closer friends has witnessed this and told me that ""something is wrong with me"" if I don't think they're creeps or bad people for doing that to me, and even worse, that I must have had a traumatic experience which conditioned me to be okay with this. And I think that this is a rather invalidating thing to say.

Now, only people I know personally have done that to me. Strangers have never done that, and in that case I would feel violated. But obviously there exists people out there who enjoy that unprompted behavior even from strangers. And there are people who would condone much more than an unprompted ass slap or someone making sexual comments. Do you think these people are ""damaged""  or do you think of it more as ""you do you""?

And keep in mind I'm NOT asking what you think of the people doing these things (""perpetrators""), so this discussion isn't about that. I'm well aware of the idea that they are still problematic even if the other person doesn't mind. Right now I'm focusing entirely on the people to whom the ""perpetrators"" are doing these unsolicited sexual acts, rather than the perpetrators themselves.",1

There's one argument that I've heard which is that straight erotica is usually centered around straight men and not women, so women use MLM erotica...but isnt that just trying to justify fetishization?

6. What do you think a person could do today that would be a good start in, for example, getting people to question their problematic beliefs and start a wave of questioning and change within themselves and those around them? 
7. What do people do that you think are harmful to the movement and why do you think such things are harmful?
8. Do you have any thoughts as to what might be good, bad, needs reinforcement, or needs improvement for the sake of the movement?

I want to hear your opinions, I wish to better understand my fellow human beings as well as learn and grow from your experiences. I cannot temper my thoughts, ideas, and beliefs in a vacuum.

Please enlighten me.

\[EDIT\]: In case you're overwhelmed, please feel free to pick any set of questions or even answer all of 'em if you feel like it. You don't have to answer all at once and I'd value your opinion even if it's on only one of the many topics I wish to gain perspective on. Any insight, whether it's to a question on this list or a subject that you feel needs to be heard is valuable.

So pick a topic, any topic within the scope of this post, I'd love to hear what you have to say.

How and why you think are just as important as the content of your thoughts.

\[EDIT 3\] Changed question 6 for better focus, was previously ""What do you think people could do that would benefit the movement and why do you think doing those things are beneficial?""",1
Men snapping their fingers at you,Has anyone else experienced this? it drives me through the roof. I work at a restaurant and my manger started scolding me because the new girl missed the drinks out of an order. It‚Äôs no big deal it happens we aren‚Äôt perfect. Anyways this male cashier comes on the kitchen and starts asking me questions when my manger is talking to me. Obviously I ignore him because i‚Äôm in the middle of the conversation. Then he starts snapping his fingers at me to get my attention. When I tell you it took everything in me not to go off on him. It made me so angry do not snap at me like a dog.

Serious question from a guy who‚Äôs from a mixed race family about his little sister.,"Hey people, so I never thought I would find myself on a feminist page as I‚Äôm not very political but I have a genuine question concerning my little sister. 

My family is biracial and I look very white like my mother but my sister is dark skinned. Well recently she started dating this guy and when talking to my female friend she made the comment ‚Äúof course your sister had to date the only black guy in school.‚Äù 

The comment seemed innocent but it really rubbed me the wrong way. I have heard other comments such as ‚Äúguess she wanted to be with one of her own‚Äù. These are really bothering me because I have grown up with my sister and I know for fact that she chose the man she‚Äôs with because he‚Äôs an awesome guy and when I see them interacting he really knows how to connect with her. She didn‚Äôt choose him because he looked like her, my sister is a deep and intuitive person. 

I guess now that I‚Äôm older I‚Äôm having to confront the fact that society sees her and her decisions as that of a ‚Äúblack girl‚Äù and not as her own. 

How can I be there for her and what is a good way to respond to these ridiculous statements so I can defend my little sister. 

I love her and I hate seeing the box society tries to put her decisions into. Idk, I know this a long rant/question but I‚Äôm at a loss here. 

I grew up with her and now that she‚Äôs older I hate seeing people assume she‚Äôs a certain way because she‚Äôs a woman or because she‚Äôs black or both and If anyone here has seen or experienced the same thing, what are some good ways to shut down negative comments and ignorance without accusing the other of intentionally being rude/mean.",1
Is calling women ‚Äúfemales‚Äù sexist?,"Just got down voted to oblivion for asking this (edit : making this assertion) in another thread. To my generation it is sexist.

Sexual harassment and the micro aggressions that come with it.,"So I'm a pretty helpful person at my job. I work at a warehouse and unfortunately the training at night is non existent. I am at a place where I can train the main job basics. The problem lately is that this person has taken my kindness in giving him directives and patience as God knows. But he does cringey fucking shit. For instance...he comes up behind me....and asks me a question in my bubble. I don't have a huge bubble because most people don't tend to cross it. But there are some people...in my experience, men, who do this. Or if he walks by when it's close quarters he can slide by me while touching my shoulder. *cringe city*  If anyone did that after 3 days of knowing me...I'd cringe. But for me...it goes like this: if he doesn't do it to his male peers at work...don't fucking do it to females. Fuck societal whatever it is that makes us think..""but it's opposite gender so it's different."" No...it's NOT. Thoughts? I've even said shit like...""dude  you walked all the way over here to ask me that and touch my shoulder?...I'm busy and you had people over there to help. Don't do that.""

'Yeah but actually...' from Men when talking about sexual abuse of children (Trigger Warning!!!),"I think I need help here. 

Recently I have listened to the podcast 'Lolita' (tw: child sexual abuse, rape, grooming, violence) that discusses the original text of the book by Nabokov and how pop culture somehow twisted it into this forbidden love story and often frames Dolores as the seductress that knew what she wanted and so on.

I talked to my friends about it to get their opinion on it, and what just stands out to me is that every woman just simply agrees that an adult man and a child of 12 can not have a sexual and romantic relationship and that there's basically no grey area, neither in the book (that gives us the narrative of a pedophile who frames the grooming of a child in a certain light to sound less incriminating) nor in real life. It's abuse, it's rape, it's not morally debatable even if the child would later say (which Dolores did not!) that she has not been coerced etc

Now, a significant number of the men I talked to (3 out of 5 to be precise), all of whom I consider great people and all self-identified feminists, agreed overall, but started to do the whole 'yeah but' thing. Yeah but what did she feel, maybe she was alright with it, yeah but if she was slightly older, yeah but what if she was mature for her age etc.. In common they had that there seemed to be this assumption that, theoretically, a child could consent if the stars aligned or whatever. Now, I don't know how many 12 year olds people have been around, but honestly, am I just completely wrong here when I say that HARD NO, a 12 year old, even if they themselves at the time believe that it was consensual (something that I personally have never even heard of, and seems to be a rather absurd hypothetical situation in lights of the thousands and thousands of child abuse cases), CAN NOT give informed consent to sex with an adult, never mind to a relationship?

There has even been an instance where I wasn't even sure what we were talking about anymore or what exactly he was saying, just that there was a need for a 'but' there that just wouldn't go away.

I'm not sure if I just am very very biased, coming from a position of a woman who has been sexually harassed by a much, much older man that I trusted when I was 14, and from the position of a therapist who sees so many women who have gone through sexual abuse by an adult when they were kids. Maybe I'm not seeing the 'but' here. 

So yeah, I guess what I'm asking for is: have you made similar experiences with men on this topic and if yes, why do you think that is? Also, if you think I'm too undifferentiated and need to consider a different angle that I'm just not seeing, feel free to point it out.

Feminism &amp; Sexism activists in my social media bubble,"Update

Since I won't check reddit much more this evening: Thank you all so much for your responses and perspectives. I was searching for a place where I can have a healthy conversation about this topic and my feelings right now. My wife and I talked so much the last hours, but in the end, we have a similar idea about it, since we spent the last years together and gathered the same experiences. 

This here helped me a lot to get a better view for the bigger picture. I am more aware of my responsibility in my privileged life. 

Therefore: You people are amazing &lt;3 hope you get well, healthy and happy into 2021!



Original Post:

Hello everyone,

I hope this is the right subredit for this. In case not, feel free to advice me another one more suitable :) thank you

I really need your help on this. I was thinking about this all night long.

This is a very special and difficult topic for me. I use a throwaway account since I am highly insecure when it comes to the correct phrasing and possible negative reactions. Moreover, English isn‚Äôt my primary language, so apologize for grammar or spelling mistakes.

**tl;dr: Within my social media bubble, I get increasingly hurt by messages (mostly tweets) that are phrased very radically. There is no way to have a healthy and constructive conversation, since I am a man and therefore ‚Äúmansplaining‚Äù. By now I tend to think that I should accept this, swallow my hurt feelings and accept, that the overall topic is so important, that my hurt feelings less important.**

I am a man in my early thirties, and I am CEO of a company in social media marketing (thus making this topic extra important but also extra explosive). I am also married to a wonderful wife and we have a 3-year-old son. We are a couple for almost 14 years now and know each other for 17 years.

The reason I mention this is that in both roles of my life, I am trying to regularly reflect on my decisions and my own thoughts. On whether there is some underlying aspect of sexism, leading me to certain impressions or ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù decisions. I have the luxury of having a wife and colleagues who let me discuss this topic and therefore evaluate the situations. Sexism, like many other topics in our society, are moving an evolving which is why I think it is important to talk and discuss about them continuously. In my opinion, this is the foundation of change: A healthy, inviting and constructive atmosphere in order to discuss and evolve.

Switching over to my actual topic: My social media bubble is currently filled with mostly women who bring up the topic of feminism and sexism. Bringing these topics to the frontline of social discussion is important and I support it as much as I can with retweets and comments and shares among my friends.

At the same time, I see more and more posts that I agree with in their essence, but not in their phrasing. Just one example (rephrased the original tweet to make an easier example):

**‚ÄúOMG men in relations who flirt with other women are so disgusting. They should learn to treat their girlfriends with respect. Girls, get up and fight!‚Äù**

Tweets like this provoke a huge social media feedback and therefore reach.

Lying and betraying a partner (or any human) is bad. I agree. And women should stand up to such a behavior. But this isn‚Äôt the message of this tweet.

My wife and I are fine with the other person flirting with others. We openly talk about sexual desires and boundaries. So while the intention of this tweet is fine, I am put in the same box with people with bad intent. There are multiple tweets that go in the same direction.

I tried to reason with the person tweeting this per DM. I said that its not about the idea and message but about the phrasing that should be differentiated, since not all men are acting like this.

The response was, a link to this article plus a big text about why it was presumptuous to message her about her tweet, since she is an activist in this topic and way better informed and educated than I probably am.

[https://medium.com/@KirstyStricklan/why-men-should-stop-saying-notallmen-immediately-f657e244f7a1](https://medium.com/@KirstyStricklan/why-men-should-stop-saying-notallmen-immediately-f657e244f7a1)

I pulled back asap, apologized for the impression I made, thanked her long message (she explained her backstory) and wished her a good evening.

I agree, that it was presumptuous to confront her with my opinion, without her asking. Additionally, even though I think her reaction was highly defensive and destructive for every healthy discussion, she probably usually has discussions like this in a way more hostile environment, leading to her always having her defense up and running for every man ‚Äúattacking‚Äù her.

But in the end, I had another two thoughts:

1. I learned that in topics like racism, sexism aso. it isn‚Äôt about the senders intent, but about how it is received. This is why, when someone confronts one with something that might be received sexist or racist, one should (constructively) converse (especially when it is clear, that there was no bad intent), reflect and adjust ones thinking and acting.However, in the current case, I am not allowed to be the receiver who is hurt by this message. On the contrary. An article like the one above tells me, the receiver, that I am wrong. And the digital society even created the word ‚Äúmansplaining‚Äù, to not only take away my right to feel hurt, but to actively make it something bad.
2. As stated in my tl;dr: I don‚Äôt define myself by this stuff on social media. I can be hurt but it won‚Äôt affect me that much. As mentioned, tweets like the one above create a high reach by high interaction rates and therefore push the topic of feminism more and more in the spotlight. Based on the phrase ‚Äúthe end justifies the means‚Äù, I would currently tend to accepting that feminism and sexism currently is no topic I can participate in, but that the current dynamic will create awareness for the topic ‚Äì even if it is by creating insecurity

There are many more thoughts and layers I have with this topic but this would make this thread even longer and more confusing.

I would like to have your thoughts on this. Do you make similar experiences on social media? Should I act differently? In all honesty: I really want to learn and understand. And I can do that best by conversing with others.

Thank you very much for your time an effort. It is much appreciated &lt;3",1

Should affirmative action in Australia be rolled back in light of the findings of the 2016 Australian Beta report?,"The prominent feminist narrative that I often hear about is that women are being turned away from job opportunities particularly by men. So apparently, the Australian government in 2016 to simultaneously expose and rectify this problem with nameless resumes. By using nameless resumes and making the recruitment process completely gender-blind, they wanted to ensure that hiring outcomes will be more equitable and that women will no longer have to be judged by anything else other than their merit. They ran a trial to examine the results and found that:

*""The trial found assigning a male name to a candidate made them 3.2 per cent less likely to get a job interview.*

*Adding a woman's name to a CV made the candidate 2.9 per cent more likely to get a foot in the door.""*

Apparently making the recruitment process fair and impartial leads to less women being hired than before.

The report just redefines this information that shows discrimination towards men as evidence that affirmative action is working and recommends keeping names on resumes.

*Overall, the results indicate the need for caution when moving towards ‚Äôblind‚Äô recruitment processes in the APS, as de-identification may frustrate efforts aimed at promoting diversity.*

But since it's quite obvious that what the report inadvertently just demonstrated is that affirmative action in Australia is indistinguishable from discrimination, should affirmative action be rolled back so that hiring outcomes aren't biased towards women?

Thoughts on Perrault's Bluebeard,"Hi r/Feminism,

Bluebeard by Charles Perrault is my very favourite fairy tale. If you don't know it, here is the [wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebeard) to it. Considering most fairy tales, Bluebeard could be termed a 'feminist' (before the term existed) tale of a woman who kills (!) and escapes from her male oppressor.

&gt;While some scholars interpret the Bluebeard story as a fable preaching obedience to wives (as [Perrault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Perrault)'s moral suggests), [folklorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklorist) [Maria Tatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Tatar) has suggested that the tale encourages women not to unquestioningly follow patriarchal rules. Women breaking men's rules in the fairy tale can be seen as a metaphor for women breaking society's rules and being punished for their transgression.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebeard#cite_note-12) The key can be seen as a sign of disobedience or transgression; it can also be seen as a sign that one should not trust their husband.

If you have come across this tale previously (or just now through this post) what are your thoughts on the tale? Do you know other fairy tales/myths which give the female protagonist agency &amp; power?

EDIT: It's *really* surprising that Bluebeard has never been made into a Disney film.",1

But these posts are spread around by anti-feminists, they dont care about that person at all, its just an attack. And people even believe the fake news they spread about these type of posts. I checked a lot of posts like these and most of them turns out to be fake. And people believe them. Further blindly agreeing with the anti feminists and saying that women have more privileges than men. It always confuses me. And what does more is that they say how it ruins the man's life and yeah they are right. But as a survivor of rape myself, it makes me mad and I know that is wrong. I think how most of the women never even report. And the ones that do, they dont really have a life after that. They will be called liars and whatnot for the rest of their lives. And the trauma it will leave... And how only just a few ever get justice and can live without much problems and thats good. And the male rape victims...they face the same stuff too coz of how men are not raped and those beliefs... So I just needed to know what would be the best way to tell people.

How would the world change if clothing and beauty products didn't exist?,"This question is a bit out there so please forgive me.

Instead of putting together outfits for the day, we live our lives in bare feet and unclothed bodies, lacking jewelry or hair products as well.

Antifeminist analogy analysis,"I‚Äôve been talking with this guy about feminism. He‚Äôs a antifeminist (aka a bigot).

He sent me this analogy for feminism whenever i said that feminism does support mens issues.

‚ÄúIt's the classic motte and bailey tactic (medieval castle analogy).
The bailey is the part of the castle where most of the actual work is done. It's several acres, filled with people working at various tasks--weaving, brewing, blacksmithing, tending livestock, etc. There will be a wall around it, but because of the large circumference of the perimeter, it is hard to defend.
The motte is a tower, set on high ground, with strong fortifications that can resist attack.
When enemies arrive, the people in the bailey retreat to the safety of the motte.
Feminists, while in the bailey, perform the work of producing and pushing anti-male ideas. These ideas are hard to defend.
Then the enemy arrives, and points to what's going on in the feminist bailey.
At which point, all the feminists in the bailey retreat to the motte and start shouting the easier to defend idea that, ""feminism is just about gender equality! Look it up in the dictionary! Pay no attention to what people were doing in the bailey--those people aren't even real feminists!""
Black Lives Matter use this ploy, too. Their bailey is filled with anti-capitalism, a plainly stated intent to ""disrupt"" the allegedly white supremacist ""nuclear family structure"", demands to abolish the police, and other extremely radical and difficult to defend ideas.
When anyone calls them on the above, they retreat to their motte, wherein they characterize the criticism as a rejection of the defensible (and pretty much universally agreed upon) idea that black lives matter as much as white lives.
It's rhetorical chicanery, but it works on low-information people.‚Äù

Financial independence of homemakers,"I come from a conservative developing country where the major feminist issues are domestic violence and economical emancipation of women. So the idea of an adult without any independent source of income (may it be via employment or social welfare) seems scary to me.

Should lookism/desirability politics be taken more seriously as its own intersection? Should we consider ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù the way we consider other privileges?,"I have ofc seen these concepts discussed, yet not as heavily as other intersections.  Attraction bias, as well, isn‚Äôt considered a social justice issue in the way other biases/prejudices are.  Should it really be normalized to call people ‚Äúugly‚Äù as an insult, whether or not a person is problematic or a member of another privileged group?

Beauty standards are mostly discussed within the contexts of racism/Eurocentricity and misogyny.  I personally feel reducing it to those alone is an oversimplification (because members of privileged groups can *not* fit certain beauty standards and be subject to attraction biases), hence my question on recognizing it as it‚Äôs own intersection.

Edit:  I think to narrow such a broad discussion, we could discuss if shaming people for being ‚Äúugly‚Äù should be condemned just as much as say, body shaming someone.  Or why judging people by looks is normalized and should it continue to be? There seems to be good discussion already on the consequences of such judgement, and how severe they are.",1

Should all social media have stricter verification?,"With all the Pornhub controversy going on, I thought this would be an interesting discussion to start.

It seems like a lot of the media focuses mostly on porn websites when there are much higher numbers of child sexual abuse content being posted on Facebook and other social media (Facebook has close to 100 million cases, and Pornhub had around 100 before they deleted all unverified content). Even on GoneWild subreddits I find myself wondering if some of the women (and other genders to a lesser extent) are even over 18, since this site doesn't require age verification. After seeing how Pornhub made the change to verification as a requirement, it made me think about how other platforms can implement this too. All sex worker platforms such as OnlyFans and ManyVids already required this, but why not apply it to general social media because of how many people lie about their age and all?

I feel like this wouldn't cause too much backlash either; I know Tinder currently has optional face verification but most people don't mind going through with it because of how simple the process is. Some people might have trust issues in regards to showing ID though, so I can see that being a problem.

However I'd love to hear what you guys think, and it's relevant to gender inequality because of how often the victims of these issues are young girls.",1
Does feminism really need Hollywood and A-list celebrities?,"I'm trying to read the signs and it seems to me that Hollywood and celebrities on the whole are losing relevance every year. It seems to be a clear trend.

Throughout the 2010's I've certainly seen more movies that tried to include feminism and more diverse representation but the format feels super old. The messages and ideas, okay sometimes but often very dumbed down and chronically behind discussions going on in social media. A lot of the time it feels like they are chasing ghosts, address problems to a show that's actually mostly dead already. Do gender switched remake movies even matter at all? 

I got concerned about how there's this new Wonder Woman movie which includes a man who's body is invaded by the spirit of WW's dead boyfriend and used for sex. So clearly, yet another wannabe progressive blockbuster that pollutes it's own intentions through glaring incompetence.

But then I thought, how many will even watch this movie? How many of those watching will do so without simultaneously fidgeting with their phones?  Superhero movies and nostalgia-trains seem to still have some hold on the Gen-X audience, but that interest is waning fast too. Nothing much else is being created.  

As for celebrities, it seems less and less people care or even listens to what they have to say anymore. Not in the pandemic, that's for sure. It's evident when we see how a couple of virologists over the world now enjoy positions as superstars. Something that couldn't happen in the past when that spotlight was reserved for actors. 

My question is, does it even matter? Does the death of movie mass entertainment and that collective culture impact feminism in any way? If so, is it in a good or bad way?",1
women in comedy,"hey so i (f20) consider myself to be a feminist. i always make an effort to support women in industries that are usually overrun by men (tattoo artists, authors, music producers, etc).
i love stand up comedy and listening to podcasts that are funny. so I want to support women especially in women in comedy since i know its a thing that people say women arent funny, ive met multiple women that are funny, so i dont believe that. but ive tried so many stand up comedians and ive listened to womens' podcasts and i do think that theyre funny, but they dont make me laugh. and i feel so bad. bc i just want to have my asthma flare up bc of how hard im laughing.  
i laugh at stupid podcasts like ""stiff socks"" and tom segura's stand up makes me laugh a lot, but like..

"My girlfriend is sexist, what can I do?","Me (27m)  and my girlfriend (26f) have been together for almost a year now, but recently something about her world view has started to cause conflict. My grlfriend is a Ukrainian immigrant who was raised in an extremely religiously conservative family and community with strict gender roles. As and teenager and an adult, she got away from it, moved on an evolved her perspective. The problem is, when it comes to issues of gender, it became uneven. What I mean by that is she doesn't apply traditional gender roles to men, really at all, and is incredibly progressive in that sense, but she still applies strong gender roles to women. She doesn't openly hate women, but deep down I know she is conflicted over some of those ideas that were taught to her, and it corrupts her judgment and leads to prejudice and at times self hatred.

 The majority of her friends are male, and she while she usually says that's just because she gets along with them better in general, she has admitted to be at times that it's because she doesn't usually trust women, even with female friends she has, she very obviously doesn't open up to them as much. She is also very quick to assume the worst of women in general, whereas she tends to give men the benefit of the doubt, and makes excuses for their behavior, something she basically never does with her women friends. Although she never admits it, I've noticed she doesn't like going to professionals who are women, I've seen her avoid female doctors, driver instructors, and lawyers. Although she has a sexually progressive outlook in theory, and is against marriage for personal reasons, I've frequently caught her slut shaming other women, and even herself. She's admitted to me before that she feels bad about having a sex life before she met me, even though she knows that doesn't make sense and I've made it abundantly clear that I don't have even the slightest issue with it and dislike the idea of chastity for my own personal reasons. 

I had noticed this all before, and addressed it a few times, but it had never become a real issue. I love her deeply, and I know trying to change someone you love is never a good idea, and also I understand that she has lived a life that makes breaking these perceptions incredibly difficult. In addition to the ""values"" she was raised with, she was abused by bother her mother and sister growing up. However, the other night things came to a head, and we finally got into an actual argument. She was telling me about how one of her guy friends (who is a card caring misogynist and serial cheater) broke up with his most recent girlfriend over, shockingly, cheating. She was defending him by saying that while cheating is bad, the women he's with should be smarter and know better. This was an especially glaring double standard since she found out one of her girlfriends was cheating on their boyfriend about a month ago, and they are still barely talking because she found that so morally objectable. During this argument, she openly admitted that she finds women cheating worse than men, which absolutely shocked me. 

I truly to love her deeply, but I just don't know how to feel. It's such a bizzare situation to feel so morally opposed to the views of your significant other. At the end of the day, I truly want what's best for her, and I believe the sexist views she holds aren't just social harmful, but also hurt her, because I've seen how she at times shames herself with them. I'm just not sure what to do.",1
"Should straight women stop calling each other ""Girlfriend""?","I was watching a Strange Aeons video (highly recommend this channel to every feminist) and she was talking about how her romantic relationships with women often aren't taken seriously. They get seen as best friends or even sisters, even when introducing each other as girlfriends (some people even ask, ""Like girl friend or girlfriend girlfriend?""). I checked the comment section and a lot of women seemed to have a common struggle when discussing relationships with parents and such. There were lots of complaints about how casual women can be when calling platonic friends ""girlfriends"", and it really made me think.

I've always found out odd when people call their friends ""Girlfriends"", because I'd never refer to buds as boyfriends. However, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this issue!",1
Why do you guys defend the child support system?,"Edit: The whole point of this post was so people wouldn't repeat the same arguments I already saw in past threads on this subreddit. Before you make an argument against one of the points in this post please read further down the post and see if I already responded to that argument.
____
I know questions about child support have been asked before, but none of the existing arguments made were convincing to me.

The main argument in favor of biological fathers paying child support is that without this system, the mother wouldn't have money to raise a child. That is, the law exists to support the child, not the wishes of the parents.

Well, public money can support the child instead, which wouldn't harm the mother or the child in any way. But wouldn't this be unfair, since the burden of paying shouldn't be put on the taxpayers? Well, if paying slightly more in taxes is such an unfair burden to the public, then it definitely isn't fair to put all the financial strain on the biological father.

That is, I think parenthood is a social construct; there's no reason a man should be considered a child's father (outside of a biological sense) just because he shares half of the child's DNA. Which why I assume it would be agreed that rape victims and sperm donors should not pay child support. But there are already documented instances of rape victims being forced to pay child support to their rapists.

The only way to avoid having male rape victims responsible for child support as the logical conclusion of the argument is to make an implicit underlying argument: that a man who has sex voluntarily is responsible for the child, and therefore deserves to pay child support. Which implies that when someone performs an activity carrying a risk of something bad happening, they're always responsible and to blame when the bad thing happens. I disagree with this.

If someone got into a car accident, we don't say they had it coming because they chose to drive a car in the first place despite being aware of the risks. In the same way, if a child is accidentally conceived even when both partners were using contraception, neither should be seen as responsible for the child.

Which is why I don't like the arguments made in this subreddit defending the child support system. To me it seems like the points typically made that ""it's only for the benefit for the child"" are disingenuous, and it's really just about punishing and blaming men for having sex using pro-life logic. I don't like that.

The child support system seems blatantly unfair to me. Women have a choice on whether or not they are considered a parent by the legal system, but men don't. The argument to this is that abortion is risky and can be a difficult choice. But it's better than not having a choice at all. And ideally a woman would be able to opt out of parenthood as well without getting an abortion. That seems much fairer than the current system, where one parent can opt out but the other cannot.

What are some arguments against this?",1
Thoughts around ‚Äúage appropriate‚Äù toys that seem... sexualized?,"So, LOL Dolls. My niece asked for these for Christmas. I didn‚Äôt get her one because they seem like dolls a pedophile would create as a means to help groom young children. My sister did get her daughter one of the dolls but is uncomfortable with it and is debating ‚Äúlosing‚Äù the doll.

I‚Äôm hoping I could get some input to help me organize my thoughts around these dolls, and maybe help me with how to talk to my sister about these dolls. I‚Äôm not going to offer her unsolicited advice - she‚Äôs genuinely conflicted about these dolls.

On the one hand, she doesn‚Äôt want her daughter to feel shamed for liking these dolls or to feel like it‚Äôs wrong for women to dress a certain way. On the other hand, these dolls are dressed in lingerie and that seems not age appropriate for a five year old. There was a line of the dolls that had lingerie appear when they were run under water. It just seems like it‚Äôs grooming children to dress sexy (not that it‚Äôs wrong for adult women to dress sexy, but even if these were dolls targeted at adult women, I don‚Äôt feel like these dolls are dressed in a ‚Äúyou‚Äôll feel sexy‚Äù kind of way, but more in a ‚Äúboys will think you‚Äôre sexy‚Äù kind of way). These dolls are for ages 5+.

I tried hunting around here to see if any discussion around these dolls came up previously and couldn‚Äôt find anything. I did find [this post on trashy](https://www.reddit.com/r/trashy/comments/ac2ql4/my_3_year_olds_lol_surprise_doll_she_got_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) on a reddit wide search, which I‚Äôve linked just so people can see what these dolls look like.

I really can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm being too uptight in thinking these dolls seem inappropriate for children, or if it‚Äôs probably not a good idea to give these to my niece.",1
What do you think about consent and a definition of rape regarding a problematic plot from later Wonder Woman 1984 film?(Spoiler),"The problem is that if the gender is swapped with Superman doing the same like wonder man, there will be a major outcry. The plot is that her death boyfriend come back into another man's body through some magic. Both main characters know that and have sex later.Worse thing is that the movie doesnt dive deeper into moral implications of that and brush off like nothing.
The  body owner come back later and doesnt know about anything, and diana doesnt show any remorse for that specific problem.
The movie is supposed to be a woman empowering one and also directed and written by a quite outspoken female director. Also, many in social media are saying like the guy should be grateful to be f#$ked by a literal goddess. I think this describes one of the major problem of society and also indirectly encouraging toxic masculanity like having sex is always a win for men.",1
"Is it just me, or are women (specifically women in the west) are often left out regarding issues concerning oppressed groups?

"Do you think Alita: Battle Angel counts as either feminist or feminist friendly, despite the fact that it has some non feminist elements? In my opinion, it's way more feminist then people have been saying.","I understand that Alita was created by a man and that she had to be saved by a man once. But here's the thing. She's only a ""submissive"" female character/female character without agency for around five or ten minutes of screen time. Then, she starts gradually gaining agency and assertiveness throughout the course of the movie and not letting the man who created her tell her what to do at all.  I get that some people would say that her being saved by a guy was supposed to send a message to the audience about how she shouldn't have became all independent and stopped listening to what the guy who created her had to say but after she gets ""repaired"" by him and given a new body, she goes right back to being a character with a ton of agency again who doesn't listen to what he has to say. 

Also, she does end up having to save her boyfriend in a way that does look like a gender reversal when it happens. In addition, I think it's kind of weird that anti-feminists love this movie so much since there's literally a scene when Alita beats up an entire room full of ""hunter warrior"" men which is the exact kind of thing that anti-feminists constantly complain about.",1

I Learn Something Very Valuable(At Least For Me) Today.,"As a heterosexual male... I have been trying to be aware and supportive of pro-women movements around the world.

Even if my girlfriend was not aware or wanted to see it, I would tell her. We watched the Birds of Prey movie... she didn‚Äôt enjoy it and neither did I. The story for me was bland, but the one thing the rubbed me the wrong way was the... (don‚Äôt know how to say it without sounding a dick or controversial, but here it goes) ‚Äúhate for men‚Äù.

NOW... fast forward to today after watching Wonder Woman 84, and I ended up with that same feeling. I sat down quietly and started to think about it.

Dumb/fun movies with some sort of sexualization of women. WW84 made me see how women might‚Äôve felt when watching these type of movies.

"Globally, the alt-right have been targeting Asian women on the dating market. What can we do about it?","There is this strange phenomenon which the supposedly racist, white alt-right dudes are obsessed with Asian women, and they have some very strange, fucked up ideas about us. If you don't know what I'm talking about, here's a good introduction from NYT: 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/opinion/sunday/alt-right-asian-fetish.html

I'm a first generation Chinese immigrant residing in US. Lately someone built an online community for Chinese female immigrants all over the world. Ideologically, this community skew highly educated feminists.

Someone in US posted about her experience of meeting an alt-right dude on a dating app, she discribed how she felt disgusted and terrified by the guy on their first date in person, and her thread exploded. 

Young Chinese women from all over the north america and europe shared similar experiences. We talked about strategies for identifying and dealing with these creepy dudes at length.

We started to realize this isn't some random bad luck but a global phenomenon. These dudes are intentionally approaching asian women. I've briefly looked into white supremacist communities out of curiosity. The Asian fetish and the mental gymnastics have been around for a while. I'm not surprised at all to see these Chinese women felt the real world impact. 

It's just the first time Chinese women start to actually talk about it, our conversation is both infuriating and fascinating.

Now we want to take actions to protect ourselves against racist and misogynist dudes. We want raise awareness and educate each others. We want to share our first-hand experiences with the broad Asian and feminist communities. We want to tell our side of the story and how we felt in these situations. We want our voices heard on this matter.

I'm thinking of taking this discussion to journalists. What media shall I reach out to? The ladies don't mind translate their posts into english. But before putting in all the work,  I want to find some media committed to publish them. Ideally they should have someone who can read Chinese.

Attacks towards white women in feminism groups.,"For the past few year, I notice a lot of attacks towards white women. specifically in liberal groups. the karen slur. becky, susan...

Despite white women not having mucb control under wm's leadership.

What aren't we saying about setting boundaries in relationships?,"This goes for every type of relationship. Workplace, friendships, parental, and romantic. It's come to my attention lately that there are a lot of people in the world who have no concept of how to set boundaries, or even what healthy boundaries are. People will invade their space, touch others, or ignore their words and feelings by dismissing or belittling them. It's sad and scary to think people are still believing that this is okay.

Given, relationships are all different. There are still some basics that should be covered. School isn't something that has done a good job educating people about relationships, so sometimes people only have familial relationships to start learning from. If they have a bad home environment there are some things that they might think are normal.

There are a lot of topics to touch on, however, the biggest I feel would be boundary setting and what is and isn't acceptable. Gaining joy, acceptance, and a feeling of safety are what many hope to get out of a relationship. Even if no one is perfect it doesn't take much to stop and listen to what someone you care about is saying. So it's alarming when a person mentions that they feel lonely, ignored, or scared in a relationship. Should a person stretch themselves too thin it can be very draining.

So, where would be a good place to start in learning to set boundaries? Ideally, this is something that people should learn from their parents. Not everyone will get this though. The line 'my house, my rules' comes to mind. People can make their own rules should someone be living with them. However, it doesn't make it right to take away the freedom and autonomy of another. It often leads to people being stuck in abusive situations.

Extending on this, should someone grow up in a bad situation it might continue on in friendships and relationships. Picking on a spouse or being treated poorly by a spouse and thinking that these things are normal and okay. Often times even in media it'll rear its ugly head. There are so many jokes about a spouse being trapped or chained down. This shouldn't be a normal feeling.

People can also be extremely possessive or draining on friends. Some people need support and that's okay. However, it's not normal to dread speaking to a friend for whatever reason. So, my biggest concern is how can this start being addressed on a bigger scale? An open dialogue seems to be the best place to start.",1
Can men talk about sex and not be considered sexist?,I‚Äôve noticed that there has been talk about something called ‚Äúlocker room talk‚Äù. According to the internet this is men talking about sex and some articles are straight up saying that it‚Äôs wrong for men to talk about sex at all. Aren‚Äôt there ways in which men can talk about sex in non degrading ways? I understand where these articles are coming from as sometimes men will use terms like ‚Äúpounding‚Äù that imply painful sex or use swear words to refer to body parts. But presumably is there is a moral difference between a man ‚Äúit felt so good when I Bleep bleep bleep‚Äù and a guy saying something like ‚Äúit felt amazing to have my penis inside her vagina‚Äù. I‚Äôm just very confused about the disctinruon between positive and negative conversation.,1
Why are men so obsessed with who women choose to date? And why do men so outwardly express resentment and hate for women due to loneliness and rejection while women deal with the same issues by internalising them?,"Being a fireman and spending a lot of time with men, and then just seeing groups and posts by men, it's clear men have a bizarre obsession with who women choose to date.

And these men are all over the map with their resentment and anger of the type of men women choose.  It ranges from women dating broke and lazy men who treat them bad to women choosing well off men that spoil them and then everything in between as long as it's negative.  It seems like as long as they're not being picked, women just must be picking bad or subservient weak men.

These men, which I don't believe are a small minority, don't just resent women, they also resentment the men they date and automatically assume they're shitty men.  

And let's be clear here, these men only resent and hate women they consider attractive.  Women they don't, who also go through rejection and loneliness, they don't even exist in their mind.  Because women they don't deem attractive are invisible, because they don't matter.  This is why you basically see men's groups, whether their alt right or menslib, you rarely see an acknowledgement that rejected and lonely women exist.  Because they really don't in their minds.

Then of course these men turn to groups that are nothing but terrorist groups aimed at harming women.  Many turn violent and commit terrorist acts like mass murder, abuse, harassment, threats of rape and murder, etc.

I know the catch-all for men's issues is men can't express their feelings.  The reality is, men have been incredibly proficient in creating massive communities of support to vent their feelings.  I don't think anyone is unsure of how these men feel because their dealing with their issues stoicly or suppressing them.  They're pretty much in your face and have caught societies attention.  And they rarely pass up a chance to express their feelings to women.   So, I'm not sure I can believe not expressing emotions or feelings is part of the problem.

Lonely and rejected women just don't go to the extremes men go to.  And women tend to internalize rejection, they tend to blame themselves and at times deal with self-hatred for being unwanted.  And they tend to keep to themselves.  Men on the other hand are the squeaky wheel that gets the grease.  And they're making sure as many people as possible know how they feel.

So why do you think men and women react so differently to the same problem of being lonely and rejected?  And why are men so obsessed with who women date and women aren't obsessed with who men date?",1

History Question: Gender politics &amp; social stigma in ancient babylon,"Also asked this on r/history.

Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I have trouble remembering the details here, but way back when I took AP World I remember reading something about social stigma in ancient babylon but I don't know if my memory is correct or if this is bs. So, I thought I'd come here for a fact check. Anyways, I remember reading about the history of gender in the ancient world, and I remember coming across something interesting. Basically what the article said is that because property was passed down through the man in a marriage, a stigma arose around women sleeping with lots of other men. So, basically the idea was that since we could be 100% certain about the baby's mother but weren't necessarily sure of the father, there could be confusion as to whose property the kid would inherit. This could lead to lengthy legal problems, and just add up costs over time. To avoid this confusion, babylonian society began instituting laws and had a stigma around women sleeping with more than one guy. This gave rise to a stigma that influenced society up and to the present day (and is one that many people still hold, though that stigma has certainly died down a bit). Anyways, is that true? Idk if historically that is true, so I thought I would ask. I can't remember where I read that, so if you know of a source, could you please provide one? If it's not true, where did that stigma come from? To me it seems kinda dumb to base our current thinking on the property laws of a society that existed over a millennium ago, but that's just me. I'm just curious as to whether or not this is true. Thanks for the info!",1

Why do women tolerate household disarray less than men in non explicitly sexist relationships?,"I was looking at the ""mental load/you should have asked"" comic and it seems the woman is doing the work because the man doesn't see all the problems the woman sees or is comfortable with those problems existing. It seems that this couple doesn't explicitly view housework or childrearing as the woman's duty. What causes women to generally not wait until the man gets fed up with the mess and cleans it up himself? And if this discrepancy is resolved, would that solve a lot of the second shift problems in couples where housework isn't consciously assigned by gender?

Edit: how can already adult couples change so the woman is more tolerant of the mess and men less tolerant of the mess?

Can women promote toxic masculinity?,"My mother is an ‚Äúold school‚Äù feminist and my father is an academic with socialist leanings. Most of the women I‚Äôve dated would call themselves feminists too. Despite this I feel I know little of the modern feminist movement and an trying to learn more. I started reading about toxic masculinity recently and it really got me thinking.

Most of the ‚Äòtoxic masculinity‚Äô I‚Äôve been exposed to are from women. My parents and my male friends never really forced me to adopt traditional male interests like sport or cars or violent video games. But I have been told I was ‚Äúgay‚Äù for trimming my nails by my first girlfriend, that I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt manly enough‚Äù because I was a vegetarian by another woman I dated, and that I was a ‚Äúpussy‚Äù for crying once, and have had many other similar things happen over the years.

I feel that I‚Äôve definitely learnt to suppress my emotions. If I feel upset or depressed I know there‚Äôs no way I can tell my partner
(despite her knowing all about toxic masculinity- she was the catalyst for me reading up about this stuff). At worst I‚Äôd be made fun of or have what I‚Äôve said be used against me in a future argument, at best it would just be awkward. Growing up I was told it was fine to express emotion, but as an adult I feel I‚Äôve been ‚Äútrained‚Äù by women to feel that it‚Äôs just not appealing or wanted. I‚Äôm in my 30s now and can definitely say that adopting a more traditional make traits like never talking about feelings has meant I‚Äôve had way more stable relationships (though it does suck sometimes - lesser of 2 evils).

Do you think women can perpetuate toxic masculinity? And where does normal masculinity   end and toxic masculinity start?

Do you think men have more to gain or to loose in ending the patriarchy ?,"I often read feminists writing things along the lines of ""men being in a dominant position in this patriarchy, they have no interests to question it"", and the likes. Though I agree that men have a dominant position and have therefore different interests, there certainly are antogonisms, this sounds a bit zero-sum to me. Many aspects of patriarchy are hurtful to men too, and if it's nowhere as bad as it is for women, it seems to me bad enough that ending the patriarchy is probably in the best interest of everyone.

This mindset seem problematic to me on several aspects, but mostly because framing most questions in terms of privileges men should give up, without emphasizing that they would also gain from giving them up, kind of makes feminism a threat to men when it doesn't have too, and a way tougher sell too.

I'm not saying this applies to each and every problematic, there are surely examples where this is false, but it feels to me that this is the case most often than not. I'd like to know if you feel the same.

There's probably a lot to say about the allyship vs. solidarity question here too, but I don't feel like I'm read enough on that question to discuss it (though my general feeling is that a synthesis would be good). If you want to comment on this however I would be interested too.

Another thing I think stems from this kind of thinking that I'm not too comfortable with: it gives the impression that men kind of have their common interests sorted out and this what guides their opinion and actions. But men just do what's seems best, or not too bad, for themselves in the context they are in, which happen to be patriarchy. It's not uncommon that when a man expresses certain opinions, arguments like ""of course you'd say this, everything to keep your privileges"", like this is part of mens strategy or something, and when women express the exact same thing suddenly it becomes internalized sexism or equivalent. Like women cannot understand how that serves a system, but men can. That's IMO both inaccurate, and troubling, how feminists are often prone to give an agency to men they're denying women...

If you feel like I got that position wrong, men having no interests in toppling patriarchy because of their dominant position in it, clarifications are welcome too.",1

Female Firefighters,"Hi all,

I recently checked out the percentage of female firefighters in the UK and it's [a measly 6.4 %](https://www.nationalfirechiefs.org.uk/News/new-statistics-show-an-increase-in-female-firefighters#:~:text=The%20increase%20in%20the%20number,and%20rescue%20services%20were%20women). In the US it's only [around 4%](https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/Emergency-Responders/US-fire-department-profile#:~:text=In%202018%2C%2093%2C700%20(8%25),30%20and%2049%20years%20old).

I have personal reasons for looking into this but I guess I had a bit of an inkling that the figures for female fire fighters would be quite low. The below is from [this](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/firefighters/#:~:text=Roughly%204%25%20of%20firefighters%20are,fitness%20standards%20needed%20for%20firefighting) article which looks at some of the reasons as to why the figures for female fire fighters are low.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**In their paper, Danbold and Bendersky argue that acceptance of women in the fire service is hindered by a clash between the collection of traits seen as essential to be a good firefighter ‚Äî called prototypes ‚Äî and the social stereotypes commonly assigned to men and women. If the prototypical firefighter is someone who carries people out of burning buildings, that‚Äôs going to fit more closely with masculine stereotypes. That, in turn, makes it harder to imagine a woman in that role.**

Looking at the stats for female police officers (29% in the UK, 11.9% US), which arguably also has traditionally been viewed as a 'man's job', the figures are much higher. I am now wondering why there is such a lag in the firefighting service compared to the police, which are both 'emergency services' with the purpose of helping people in distress.

(My theory is that image of the firefighter is akin to the  'knight in shining armour' and that a female firefighter would not fit that ideal of the masculine saviour. Just to reiterate this is just my personal theory.) EDIT: just realised that the excerpt above substantiates this

I am pro-choice and a preference utilitarian. I have asked this on r/askphilosphy but I wanted to ask y'all as well. Here is basically my thoughts on preference utilitarianism and abortion and I wanted to make sure that it made sense and was coherent. Thanks for reading it!,"Hello,

So I am a two-level preference utilitarian ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference\_utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_utilitarianism)). Basically anything on a system level (like how we should run government, etc) I tend to be more rule based and on an individual level more classically based. Anyways, the question of abortion inevitably invites extensive moral arguments (I come from a pretty conservative family and am a man (clearly the perfect voice for abortion  and women's issues /s), but I tend to be the only one who's pro-choice in family arguments and I wanted to make sure my thoughts make sense before discussing with family). Here's my take and I wanted to see if I had a flaw in my thinking (based on the initial principles, i.e. preference utilitarianism) and if what I say makes sense. So here goes:

I believe it is ok for a woman to have an abortion should she desire it because the vast vast majority of abortions take place when it's either in the earlier fetal stage or just a clump of cells (it is ok at later stages as well, it's just easier to discuss if we talk about a clump of cells). Those cells aren't sentient, and they don't have preferences, but a woman does, so her preference overrides that of the cells. Now, the counter to this that I have spent the most time thinking about is: Well doesn't that cluster of cells have a future to consider? Couldn't it have preferences that could be fulfilled? Yes, that's true, but the keyword is could. There is no guarantee that the cells would become a human being would on net fulfill the desires of those around them. They could be a fundamentally unhappy person who doesn't want to live the life they're living. They could also be the next Bill Gates, we have no way of knowing. You can't know that for certain. Personally, I find the first option more likely because by definition if a woman wants an abortion, she clearly doesn't want a kid, so she's not likely going to be the best mother she can be, it's just not really possible because deep down their preference to not be a mother would add up over time. That is a very strong preference and the kid would really have be guaranteed to satisfy a lot of preferences to overcome that. And frankly, we can't know if they will. Sure maybe, but we do know that the mother doesn't want to be a mother here and now, and we can predict this will likely remain true in the future. That's not even to factor in the preferences that would be satisified if we treated everyone like that had a right to personal autonomy (in perference utilitarianism this idea is where rights come from). This is all true of cases where the mother's life isn't in danger, but it is even more true in cases where her life is in danger (after all, she'd prefer to you know, not die), so that is an even stronger preference. Fundamentally, because there is a guarantee that the mother will have deep unsatisfied preferences that only add up over time (she may have to sacrifice opportunities and dreams she would've otherwise taken to be a mother), and the serious lack of a guarantee that the child would fulfill preferences, we have to treat the child's life as neutral and look at the negative utility that results from pregnancy, we find that the mother should be able to have an abortion should she so desire.

Also, side note #1. If we take the cells could live a happy life conclusion to its logical end, then technically every single genetically possible human should be created, and not only that, but we should engage in extensive cloning efforts because more people = more preferences met. Nobody is advocating for this, for good reason.

Side Note #2. Adoption. I will admit this one is trickier to address and may seem, from a ultilitarian point of view, a better option than abortion, however the statistics from adoption don't usually look all that good, and you have to factor in the negative utility that comes from pregnancy in and of itself and the negative utility from a lack of a right to bodily autonomy, as such, abortion is still a viable and good option to take in that situation. Plus if we see adoption as better because it allows the preferences of the cells to be met, clearly side not #1 is also true, so you and I shouldn't be arguing as you should be off making ever single genetically possible human and cloning yourself. Doing otherwise is hypocritical.

Anyways, is this coherent and does it make sense?

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

Forgot to add, the huge number of abortions that result from sexual assault, rape, and truly tragic circumstances. It is even easier to argue for allowing abortion in those cases because of the strong preferences involved. Also, as many a feminist has pointed out, outlawing abortion inevitably lead to illegal abortions, which are always shadier, and riskier, but will definitely happen. ",1

Are women‚Äôs dating preferences problematic?,"What are your thoughts on women‚Äôs preferences for men that earn more than themselves and for men that exhibit benevolent sexist behaviours? There is a vast amount of literature documenting women‚Äôs preference for men that are [high earners](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40806-016-0048-6#Sec10), even for women with a [higher education](https://ifstudies.org/blog/better-educated-women-still-prefer-higher-earning-husbands) and income. Although according to [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/20/americans-see-men-as-the-financial-providers-even-as-womens-contributions-grow/), as of 2017, women earn more than men in 28% of married and cohabiting couples, which is promising progress. Yet, despite¬†the prevalence of this preference I do not see it discussed very much, if at all, by feminists. This is surprising to me as I would have thought feminists would be imploring women to prioritise other qualities in a potential partner, such as: empathy, egalitarianism, kindness, patience, etc.

However, what is even more surprising is a [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325153053_Benevolent_Sexism_and_Mate_Preferences_Why_Do_Women_Prefer_Benevolent_Men_Despite_Recognizing_That_They_Can_Be_Undermining) that found that women prefer men that possess benevolent sexist attitudes despite the [potential downsides](https://theconversation.com/why-women-including-feminists-are-still-attracted-to-benevolently-sexist-men-101067). This was true for ‚Äúhigh feminist and low feminist women‚Äù. Is it not a problem that¬†a significant portion of women, including feminist women,¬†prefer¬†benevolent sexist men?

"Even when girl's education led to them being firmly shackled to domestication, girl's still outperformed boys in academia in all subjects.

*A review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million boys and girls who were students from 1914 to 2011 blows apart that idea. For 100 years, according to the data that included students from 30 countries, girls have been outperforming boys in all of their classes ‚Äî reading, language and math and science. And they‚Äôve been doing it throughout their academic careers, from elementary school to high school. Which also means that the ‚Äúboy crisis‚Äù ‚Äî the worry that boys have recently been falling precipitously behind girls academically ‚Äî is also a fallacy. They‚Äôve been getting lower grades than girls for a century.*

Even when sexism and misogyny cut off the vast majority of careers and the workforce to women, and girls could really only dream of becoming maybe a nurse, secretary or teacher, they still outperformed boys who had access to higher education, the majority of careers and the workforce.  Just based on that you'd think girl's would believe education was a waste of time, leading to resentment and there would be a ""girl crisis"" where girl's would get lower grades than boys.

So girl's outperforming boys, even in math and science isn't something new.  Despite the myth we so often seen propagated in alt right and even progressive men's groups that this is a relatively new phenomenon plaguing boys due to the ""feminization"" of academia.

Marxist Feminism: What are cis white men supposed to be doing?,"Hello all and thanks to any and all giving their time to read or reply.

I'm a cis white male who has spent a lot of time studying Marxism, communism, etc... and have been trying lately to incorporate a lot of Marxist Feminism/Intersectional feminism into my studies. I've had a really hard time ingesting this material and an even more difficult time ingesting  more liberal/centrist feminism. I understand the need for spaces where men aren't allowed to communicate, nearly every podcast I could find on these topics was female-exclusive, but where is the bridge for cis white men to even understand the concepts that are being taught? Every five minutes is a random gut punch where a host, usually a PhD or Masters level white woman, takes a crack at cis white men (usually always random and for the purpose of some type of joke), and I find myself wondering how long I can listen before giving up. For context I've listened several hundred hours of Marxist content and probably 20-30 hours of Feminist Marxist content. At the end of every segment I am still left wondering what is wanted from me and generally just left with the impression that disappearing is the only desired outcome. Very rarely a white male makes an appearance, on the few podcasts where they're allowed, and there is always a lot of them just joining in on the bashing with little information on what the appropriate action is from a white male.

I'm just kind of confused. I could never share any of these podcasts with my brother or even male peers be they white or not because they seem uninterested in offering actionable content so much as just random ridicule. As a white male who grew up in a trailor park and still can't make ends meet, with a lot of abuse and trauma to boot, I guess I'm just not sure how modern or left feminism intends to overcome the struggles of a patriarchal or capitalist society without white men.

I apologize if I'm coming from such a narrow perspective but I'm just lost after a lot of time and research. I know we live in a patriarchy. I know we live in a white supremacist world. What I don't understand is how extremely well educated women plan on broke af white men ever gaining the perspectives and knowledge necessary to help be part of the solution. Thanks for any insights you can give and please give any critiques you want as well. I'm trying to gain thicker skin through all of this and my personal leanings are toward a socialistic/communistic end. I think the patriarch harms men as much as women if you look at the death and trauma boys go through, but I'm just not seeing a lot of compassion coming out of any of the places I seek perspective from and I'm having a really hard time figuring out how I am supposed to move or contribute to solutions.

Though who knows, I had to drop out of school due to monetary and 2020 reasons, so who knows if I'll even be able to get my undergrad much less my graduate degree...

A former male friend hates feminism in my DM's,"I post many different topics on my private Instagram account, from diet culture, racism, to the fall of patriarchy and personal experiences with men. A guy (23) from my former school class has been following me for half a year. We haven't seen each other for 3 years. He always seemed nice and harmonious and we got along great. No drama, no sexism, nothing. Since he has followed me, he has been answering my statements in the stories 3 times a week, accusing me of hating men and that a lot more people would listen to me if I were to formulate my feminist opinion ""nicer"". The usual talk.  But even when I deal with other topics that don't attack him as a man (e.g. ""Calorie reminder for the holidays: 1200 calories are the daily requirement of a toddler. Not that of an adult woman."") he texts me and annoys me. He describes my information as baseless and compares me to a flat earther.

He uses various manipulation techniques when I call him out on his behavior: ""I'm sorry that I questioned you. Maybe I'm just controlled by patriarchy and the diet culture!"" He is committed to misunderstanding me.

We text back and forth. Sometimes I think he has a romantic interest in me because he often attacks me when I've posted nice selfies beforehand. On the other hand, I'm taken and he has had a girlfriend for 2 years. And knocking someone down is not nice either. I don't want to block him because I've always liked him. On the other hand, it steals my energy.

Does anyone have an explanation for this behavior? Has that happened to you before?",1
"Hello, being a dude can make you unaware of many issues women have day to day so i need some help","

Dismissing sexual frustration,"As a guy I believe the following statements are true 

1. Wanting romantic/sexual companionship and not having it sucks, and the longer you go without it, the more it sucks.
2. No other human being on the planet is obliged to provide you with such companionship, and there is no sure-fire formula for getting it.

Now, if a chronically single man agrees with me that both of these statements are true. The best we as a society can do is commiserate the tragedy of human existence. But from what I've seen, almost everytime someone says how much rejection/friendzone/unrequited love/etc, makes them feel horrible, someone else will make a rather unfriendly and dismissive comment about how ""women don't owe you sex"" or something about ""putting niceness in and expecting sex to come out"". Even when there's absolutely no indication that person thinks so.

Some people might say it's common enough to just assume they have these beliefs. But I disagree that this is how you justify being shitty to someone. It is presumptive, aggressive, accusatory, and rude. People can feel frustrated about it without also feeling entitled. I don't think it's unreasonable for someone to say ""I'm frustrated because I'm not able to start a relationship or have sex"" without being told they're an entitled twat for that.

And I think this is at the core of the problem of why male loneliness is at a record high. People are always ready to point out statement #2, but they don't really internalize the significance of statement #1. This is what leads to incel communities being made and the male suicide rate being 3.5x higher than women. Not only are lonely men not able to find satisfaction in their lives, they are constantly having there issues and feelings dismissed.

I'm honestly kinda ranting but I really want a feminist take on this. Sorry for any grammar or format errors, on mobile",1

What do you do when your family has non-feministic attitudes?,"I have just found out that my younger sister ‚Äôs teacher makes what I think are inappropriate and sexist jokes. My sister thinks it is ok for her (male) teacher to make jokes about a girl‚Äôs appearance (joking in a zoom class about her not wearing makeup and looking bad because of it), and inappropriate jokes about a fellow female teacher (on zoom this male teacher and a female teacher turned up wearing the same colours. The female teacher commented on the coincidence joking that they must share the same wardrobe, the male teacher ‚Äújoked‚Äù that they put on the same clothes/colours just after getting out of bed together‚Ä¶). My sister thinks this is funny and not gendered, everyday sexism hidden in the form of a joke to justify it. She says he does it to everyone but the only two examples she could give me where when he made jokes about the girl and woman (therefore in this instance, clearly gendered).

My mum‚Äôs attitude is that we just need to take a step back and let the world ‚Äúsort itself out‚Äù. When I push back on her attitude by saying, ‚Äú*We* have to sort the world out, it‚Äôs not just going to do it by itself‚Äù, she changes the subject and glosses over what I am saying. My other family members are basically the same, with the women in my family full of internalised misogyny, and I can‚Äôt seem to resonate with any of them for very long about feminism as a whole. Because of this I am finding I am distancing myself from them more and more as it just infuriates and frustrates me that they won‚Äôt see/aren‚Äôt willing to see how 3rd wave feminism is a good thing and how it is very much needed in our current society.

How do I reach them and teach them about the need for feminism in a way that they‚Äôll actually listen? How do I show my sister that feminism is good and that there is everyday sexism that she is shrugging off? Sadly, I really doubt that there is much hope of changing my mum and the other family members as they‚Äôre stubborn and their believes are deeply ingrained in them, but I really want to try to reach my sister even if it is just to get her thinking about everyday encounters from a feminist perspective. Obviously, I don‚Äôt want to push it on her if she really doesn‚Äôt want to listen, but I want to try as I don‚Äôt want to distance myself from her too. I was thinking of getting her a feminist book for her birthday, but I don‚Äôt think she would appreciate it let alone actually read it. So I‚Äôm not really sure what to do. Any suggests or ideas would be greatly appreciated!",1

Question about abortion,"I am 100% pro-choice and I believe, that abortion should be legal until the fetus is able to survive on its own. However I am very concerned with the trend, that many cis women decide to abort fetuses with traits they deem as undesirable (we see this trend in iceland with down's syndrome fetuses).

As more scientific progress occurs, I fear that cis women will choose to abort other fetuses, that they deem undesirable (like gay people, trans people, people with autism) as soon as it is scientifically possible to detect these things in a fetus. There would only have to be a minor cultural shift and cis women have the choice to exterminate any group of people they want.

My question is how can we ensure, that trans, gay, autistic and other people will not disappear like down's syndrome people in iceland, as soon as these traits are detectable?",1
Do you feel that it's wrong/unreasonable for a man/woman to expect the person they are dating to abstain from sex while they are initially testing the waters?,"Of course anyone has a right to set their own boundaries, reasonable or otherwise. But do you find it reasonable or perhaps toxic/reductive if someone only wants to get serious when their partner has waited to have sex during the early stages? Does it say something bad about them?

Is it unreasonable to break up with someone if you found out that while you were dating  that they'd been hooking up with other people? Is it odd for that to bother you? Not expecting your partner to be a virgin whose never been in a relationship but specifically when the two of you were dating.  Is this a bad standard to put on people?",1

***Arguments for why feminism has failed:***

Men still -

1. run 91% of countries (175 out of 192)
2. run 95% of companies [https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-so-few-ceos-are-women-you-can-have-a-seat-at-the-table-and-not-be-a-player-11581003276](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-so-few-ceos-are-women-you-can-have-a-seat-at-the-table-and-not-be-a-player-11581003276)
3. are 90% of millionaires [https://www.verdict.co.uk/90-percent-millionaires-male/](https://www.verdict.co.uk/90-percent-millionaires-male/)
4. are 88% of billionaires [https://www.statista.com/statistics/778577/billionaires-gender-distribution/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/778577/billionaires-gender-distribution/)
5. see 22% of their workforce make $100,000 or above in the United States compared to just 9% of women [https://dqydj.com/2018-income-by-sex/](https://dqydj.com/2018-income-by-sex/).

* The gender pay gap remains stagnant. In the US for instance, men earned $66,000 on average pre-tax in 2017 compared to women making $45,000. In 2020, it's $72,000 to $51,000. The pay gap is larger in other first world countries and of course much larger in second and third world territories, and it's expected to RISE rather than decrease in the future due to the effects of the pandemic.
* Violence against women is at it's highest rates in decades, in the US, Europe and elsewhere around the world. Femicides in particular are surging at levels rarely seen before. Some of the sources on the growing violence can be seen here [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-games/201909/the-number-women-murdered-partner-is-rising](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-games/201909/the-number-women-murdered-partner-is-rising), here [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/domestic-violence-international.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/domestic-violence-international.html) and here [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-latam-violence-trf/rising-violence-against-women-in-latin-america-confirms-fears-of-abuses-in-lockdowns-idUSKBN23G2X6](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-latam-violence-trf/rising-violence-against-women-in-latin-america-confirms-fears-of-abuses-in-lockdowns-idUSKBN23G2X6).
* Female employment on the whole is at its lowest levels since 1988 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/2020/11/06/women-workforce-jobs-report/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/2020/11/06/women-workforce-jobs-report/) and the figures could well struggle to rebound for a generation [https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-55016842](https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-55016842).
* Women continue to struggle to break into high-paying male dominated fields, comprising a majority in low paying professions like nursing, teaching and healthcare while struggling to climb above 10-15% of money making jobs in engineering, finance, law or as doctors etc. An example of this can be seen in a gender breakdown of doctors by speciality [https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2018/10/men-outnumber-women-3-to-1-in-some-specialties-in-the-u-k/](https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2018/10/men-outnumber-women-3-to-1-in-some-specialties-in-the-u-k/).",1

What should a guy do if they see someone getting catcalled or harassed?,"Hello,

I'm a guy. I saw a post on here today about someone being unsure of what to do when they are catcalled. I realized that had I been in the situation the poster there described, I wouldn't have known what to do. So, I thought I'd ask: how should I respond when I see someone getting catcalled or harassed? Like say I'm at work and I notice my boss being too touchy-feely with a female co-worker and she has expressed to me it makes her uncomfortable. What should I do in that situation? Should I even intervene or should I leave the situation alone, I want to help but I don't want to make things worse. I don't know, as a guy I've never been catcalled or harassed. I don't really know how to respond if I see it happening or even if i should for fear of making things worse for the victim. So yeah, how do I respond?

Why there are women who aren‚Äôt feminists?,,1
"Is saying America or Canada have a problem with femicide as well as it being unsafe for women an insult to other nations like Mexico, SA, etc?","I see American/Canadian feminists claim that we have a problem with 'femicide' in America or Canada.

I personally dont know any woman who's been murdered. Hell, in my state of colorado, with a pop.of 5million, the number of murders was what, 32 in 2018? In my very safe city, not sure the number, I'd wager it's LESS than 10.

My neighborhood is also safe. I see girls out all the time, day and night. None of them seem to be in any fear. Hell, my sisters and mom used to go out all the time b4 covid. My sister doesnt fear going out at night at all.

It's been like this everywhere I've lived. Not sure if it's just the girls I interact, but none of them seem to fear going out at all in night. None of them seem to be as scared as you would think when you read feminists comments online (that women fear going out aline at night). It's like this here, as well as back in AZ. Or when I visit fam in Xanada.

My main question is, is saying America (or Canada) has an issue with femicide an insult to other countries like Colombia, SA? Also, I've seen the 3women/killed per day in America. That amounts close to 1100 women murdered per year in America. With a pop. of 320mil. Compared to others nation with a MUCH lower population, as well as more women being killed. Is this diminishing the meaning of femicide?",1

Do you think feminist rhetoric can cause sexual repression in young men who are most sympathetic to feminist concerns?,"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070917210115/http://www.feministcritics.org/blog/2007/06/19/when-you-have-feminist-guilt-you-dont-need-catholic-guilt/](https://web.archive.org/web/20070917210115/http://www.feministcritics.org/blog/2007/06/19/when-you-have-feminist-guilt-you-dont-need-catholic-guilt/)

This blogpost is what made me want to ask this question, so please read through it if you'd like. But it's basic argument is that there are a hell of a lot of people attracted to women who seem to have internalized the message that their attraction makes them sick and wrong and evil and creepy, that basically any interaction they have with a woman is coercive or harmful on their part, and that initiating a romantic interaction makes them a sexual predator.

I relate to this post quite a lot. I internalized these messages from exposure to feminist memes, norms, and communities. It was feminist messages, not catholic or religious ones, that made it hardest for me to come to terms with my sexuality. It wasn‚Äôt intentional. But it happened. And it has happened by now to enough people that 'well obviously you‚Äôre misinterpreting it‚Äô is starting to wear thin as an excuse. Lots and lots of people are misinterpreting the way I did. By and large, we‚Äôre vulnerable people. I suppose the response I expect the most is a denial of the existence of this phenomenon, or even the possibility of it. But that would just prove to me that the male experience will always be invalidated in the face of the dominant narrative, irrespective of how much it matters.",1
"What do you think about this statement from 'The Palgrave Handbook of Male Psychology and Mental Health' regarding the phrase ""toxic masculinity""?","&gt;There is a serious risk arising from using terms such as ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù. Unlike ‚Äúmale depression‚Äù, which helps identify a set of symptoms that can be alleviated with therapy, the term ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù has no clinical value. In fact it is an example of another cognitive distortion called labelling (Yurica et al. 2005). Negative labelling and terminology usually have a negative impact, including self-fulflling prophecies and alienation of the groups who are being labelled. We wouldn‚Äôt use the term ‚Äútoxic‚Äù to describe any other human demographic. Such a term would be unthinkable with reference to age, disability, ethnicity or religion. The same principle of respect must surely apply to the male gender. It is likely therefore that developing a more realistic and positive narrative about masculinity in our culture will be a good thing for everyone.",1

What are your issues with pornhub? What are some alternatives?,"Recently porn hub has deleted over 1 million videos created by unverified users to try to remedy some recent complaints about videos that have violated their guidelines.


 A lot of people have been critical of this move but I personally like that they‚Äôre attempting to pay CLOSER attention to abuse and general fucked up shit on their site. 

 I‚Äôve abstained from a lot of the mainstream porn sites these past couple of months. My main Hang ups about most of the sites is that they seem indifferent to abuse on their site. 

Due to the vast nature these that are inherent to these YouTube-like platforms, I don‚Äôt expect EVERYTHING to be clean. Even on YouTube there are some pretty fucked up corners, just because there‚Äôs some illegal shit on their site doesn‚Äôt mean they support it. But I also think that porn sites are a lot more vulnerable to illegal fucked up shit cuz it‚Äôs to appease the viewers sexual hunger. So I think it should be a high priority to moderate these sites for the safety of people all over the world since they‚Äôre inherently MORE LIKELY to contain that content.

Again, this isn‚Äôt a fool proof method. But I do respect that they‚Äôre directly addressing this issue.

I came back to the site to give it my, let‚Äôs say ‚Äúviewer support‚Äù but my question to y‚Äôall is, what are some of your hang ups or criticisms with specifically pornhub. I don‚Äôt think porn is inherently misogynistic, but I don‚Äôt wanna enable some misogynistic tendencies (if that wording makes sense). I dont wanna lean on ONE THING I respect about pornhub to justify all the other BS that goes on behind the scenes. Porn is nice, but some things matter more than momentary fulfillment.

Another question, what are some good alternatives to the mainstream porn sites? Mainly, porn sites with a feminist mindset or a site that‚Äôs heavily moderated to prevent abuse from slipping under the cracks. 

Bellesa was a pretty nice one that‚Äôs free. Other sites I‚Äôve searched have only had a paying option. Maybe it‚Äôs just the reality that you have to pay to support some of these underground sites, but any feedback would be appreciated.",1

Why do people forget that the FGM ban declared unconstitutional - because of male circumcision,"So First off I am strongly against all forms of genital cutting, which makes me a subject of ridicule in the United States, where most people support male circumcision and body shame people like me who are intact. So recently I found out that FGM became legal in the United States because the ban was ruled unconstitutional because it included a ban on all forms of FGM, including the rare minor form Called hoodectomy, which is directly equivalent to male circumcision. I am aware that most of you are against circumcision and I am grateful to know that. I am wondering why people haven‚Äôt realized that to eradicate all forms of FGM we constitutionally must ban male circumcision and intersex surgeries as well. The only way to ban hoodectomy is to ban male circumcision with it. Do you have some ideas why people didn‚Äôt pay attention to the fact that male circumcision is causing FGM to become legal?

Are men more driven and career-oriented?,"Do men derive more pleasure from career fullfilment than women? For example, women want equal representations in top positions etc., but they tend to want work life balance, and men at the top don't want to give in to that/can get away with not taking time off for kids etc., thus they can put in more work and continue to dominate top positions.

I think even women who are committed to their work and their professional goals, who want to contribute something to the world, are interested in pursuing other things/interests, making time for family (not neccesarily children), making sure that a household runs smoothly and that everyone around them is taken care of etc., more than men are.

Is this because of how men and women are raised, or because of our biological make-up, or both? Should we try to change this? if so, in what way?

Like, a protest that occurred in Portland about BLM. Black ppl getting killed by cops and all. And some white woman decided to undress herself and stand in front of the cops. Butt a$$ naked. Flashing her genitals. Like what did she achieve with that? I dont see any correlation between BLM, and getting naked in front of cops? I'm just curious to know whats your opinion on that.

Women/Girl's pain treated less seriously than Men/Boy's pain.,"[Study's have found that female patient's pain is treated less seriously as male patient's pain.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/31/americans-take-pain-girls-less-seriously-than-that-boys-new-study-finds/)  This article is dealing with young girl's pain but there are studies that show that [women's pain is taken less seriously than men's pain.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/is-bias-keeping-female-minority-patients-from-getting-proper-care-for-their-pain/2019/07/26/9d1b3a78-a810-11e9-9214-246e594de5d5_story.html)  Women are not only have to wait longer to receive medication for pain, they receive pain med's less than men.  And women are given psychiatric medication for pain at a much higher rate than men.  

As a first responder it wasn't unusual for EMT's to assess women for mental conditions before treating them for pain.  It also wasn't unusual for EMT's to question whether women were exaggerating their pain because of course, women are more emotional and neurotic than men.  Men are strong, stoic and reliable when talking about their pain, so if a man says he's hurting, get him some pain meds stat because it must be serious.

The biggest myth I see in progressive men's groups like menslib and alt-right groups is that the medical community ignores men and caters to women.  This must be why women access medical help more often than men?  But the truth is, women are not rewarded for being proactive about their health.  They're stigmatized as being dramatic and emotional attention seekers.  Whereas men are brave and stoic and only access help when absolutely needed.  

Just because the medical community targets women in ads doesn't mean women or girl's are treated well once they try to receive help.  Women are targeted for monetary gain because they know women are more likely to access help which means more money for hospitals and doctors.  The myth propagated by men's groups that the medical community just loves and cares about women more than men is laughable in the face of studies done in regards to the different treatment men and women receive. 

I'm interested in hearing feminist's thoughts on this subject.  How women are treated by medical professionals and why it's such a common myth that when women enter the medical system that they're needs are catered to, when studies show the exact opposite.",1
Feminists: What's your worst mansplaining story?,"I've been looking at other ask subs and enjoy reading stories from it, so I figured a more light-hearted thread may be in order here! What's your story?

The one time I did not take him with me was an eye doctor's appointment, and I left with glasses I still could not see out of, no matter how much I pleaded my case.",1

What were the various reasons for preventing women from intellectual professions?,"I recently posted a question regarding JBP's ""Patriarchy doesn't exist because men are more likely to end up in prisons and they had to die in war"" 
and I came to the most logical conclusion that patriarchy isn't necessarily a function where men aren't always ""on top"" of the social hierarchy, but its a function which puts men in charge of socitey, regardless whether they do it reactively or proactively (ie. Becoming a respected leader non-violently vs. Turning into an infamous criminal), and women having little say on the matter. Denying patriarchy existed is a shameless attemp to revise history and sociology where there are literally historical texts and ""thinkers"" not having anything favorable to say about women except for being mothers.

So when it came to educational institutions historically banning women from entering school, they could attribute it to schools being more likely to teach about fighting and therefore girls weren't allowed in schools. There was a point where these institutions no longer required to teach students solely about fighting yet they still demanded to latch onto those traditions and justify preventing women from entering .

But what about intellectual professions? What were the various reasons why women were prevented scholarships and reading?",1
So here's a question and I hope that its appropriate‚Ä¶," 

If  some male actually did the awful thing of sexually approaching a few or  couple of females inappropriately and uninvited or sexually harassing  them when he was too drunk (not that that's an excuse,as he chose to get  that drunk) before in life (and he stopped after the no and/or more  clearer -perhaps including even physical- no's to his absolutely drunken  mind at the times and then that was it as in he did not do something  like that again after those times, to whoever)‚Ä¶

Does  that mean that he deserves to be falsely accused (either officially to  the authorities or while being the victim of false rumors,gossips and  slander) later on in life by another female or other females of sexual  harassment or assault or rape or having sex or doing something sexual  with or to them when he did nothing of the sort with or to them? It's an  obvious no to me but would some people perhaps think that he deserves  it? I think that even if one not only approached and stopped after the  rejection but actually insistently sexually harassed someone or raped  them then that doesn't mean that that person deserves to be falsely  accused of other things by whoever‚Ä¶",1
Why are sexist characters on television always written to be charismatic?,"The ones that immediately come to mind are Joey from Friends and Barney from How I Met Your Mother, as they have a tendency to objectify female characters on their shows and lie to women when pursuing sex. I notice how popular these characters are among their fanbases because they're seen as ""cool"", but I see them as problematic especially considering that these shows are PG and can leave an impression on young boys.

Is it a byproduct of what the writers aspire to be, is it a type of character that male audiences find entertaining, or something else?",1
"Why have single motherhood, divorce rates and bastard children risen with the advent of modern feminism?","I see and every one knows that since the 1960's the sexual revolution, feminism, access to birth control, female sexual liberation and abortion have increased; with the latter two being subsidized by the government to some degrees. Why is it then that despite increases in medical technology to prevent unwanted birth which has granted women control over their sexual reproduction has out of wedlock births, teenage pregnancy, single motherhood is increasing and continues to increase? 
This mainly effects lower class people than upper class as is seen with the increased calls for welfare, food stamps, government subsidized child care among other things.",1
Does using products/services made in a toxic work environment make me a hypocrite?,"So just for the record I wouldn't exactly label myself as a feminist activist, but I do have strong feminist leanings and I believe women should continue to fight for equal rights in order to bring an end to sexual harassment, the glass ceiling, and an end to the toxic work environment.

From what I understand a toxic work environment is where minorities, disabled people, LGBTQ groups, and especially women are harassed, there is a culture of nepotism, and a majority of employees are constantly overworked and underpaid. When I learned about this concept I promised myself that I would not work for a company that has a toxic work environment or buy any products or services that are made by a toxic work environment.

Hopefully the first one won't be too hard, but it's the second part that worries me. I looked up some companies that have toxic work environment and I was surprised that some of my favorite companies like Disney has a toxic work environment. I know this sounds superficial but some of my favorite stress-relieving media comes from these companies like the marvel comics and movies, the pixar movies, the Studio Ghibli films, and so much more. I'm sure it may sound like peanuts to some people but these things from Disney help me have some thing to look forward to at the end of the day.

The problem is that well I feel like I'm not being true to myself because a lot of the work that the employees put into these products, are overworked, underpaid, and sometimes harassed by the upper management. I feel as if that by buying/using the products of a company that has a toxic environment I'm betraying a part of myself.

Does using a company's products and services really make me a moral hypocrite? Is there anyway to rationalize my choices?",1

Why is feminism becoming increasingly hostile towards queer people?,"Over the last couple of years I have observed what I perceive to be a significant increase in hostility towards trans people among self-identified feminists. This is especially evident in countries like the UK where transphobic feminists have a lot of institutional power and are being portrayed by the media as the dominant type of feminism. I get that a lot of this is astroturfed by conservative lobby groups like the heritage foundation and Alliance defending freedom, but I am fascinated and shocked by how so many feminists are so easily influenced by rhetoric that mirrors the hate other minority groups and women have been victims of in the past. What fascinates me even more is the increased willingness of these people to not only attack trans people, but also the broader queer community. To add even more confusion to the mix, many of these people hold positions that are very similar to mine on the overwhelming majority of feminist issues, but have seemingly bought into anti-queer propaganda for no apparent reason.

Any hate or discrimination towards minority groups is incompatible with my feminism, but I am afraid that simply brushing them off as not being feminists, is actively ignoring a growing problem that is increasingly seeping into broader feminist discourse. Why do some feminists have a propensity towards queerphobia, and why do so many seemingly progressive and reasonable people buy into regressive social ideologies that are better left in the past?",1
Do Radical Feminists consider Queer Theory to be liberal feminism?,"Do Radical Feminists consider Queer Theory to be ""liberal feminism?""

It should come as no surprise that many radical feminists like to disagree with what they term ""liberal feminists."" Those that do also tend to disagree with a lot with 3rd wave feminists, often describing third wave feminists as ""liberal feminists."" Well, queer theory is largely recognized to be part of the third wave; it tends to be sex positive, largely propelling the sex-positive feminist movement forward, and in that aspect, tends to emphasize the importance of sexual choice.

But queer theory is grounded in continental philosophy (as is a lot of third wave feminism like intersectionality), and queer theorists like Foucault have been very critical of liberalism in general. They probably wouldn't describe themselves as the same kind of feminist as Martha Nussbaum who identifies as a liberal feminist and bases her philosophy on liberalism (Locke, Rawls, Sen). And just from my personal perspective, I am not sure radical feminists disagree with Martha Nussbaum and let's say a first wave liberal feminist like Mary Wallestonecraft as much as they do queer theorists. So do radical feminists consider queer theory to be liberal feminism?",1
"Why is there such a negative connotation behind ""straight white cis males""?","I identify as a straight white cis male, and I like to think that I'm extremely progressive in my views.

How did you experience your first periods and what did you wish you were told?,"I'm doing a project on menstruation aimed at figuring out a way to make it easier, safer and less scary for young girls to learn about and deal with their first periods. For this I'm looking to gather information on how women of all ages experienced their first periods and that stage in life. I'd like to know how you learned about it, when you learned about it (before or after your first period, if, what and how you were explained on the topic, whether you received external help at all,...). Whether you experienced it as a frightening thing or if you felt safe and understood. And specifically what you feel could have made it easier on you.

For me there was a certain taboo that I felt around it. We had one sex ed class which was very graphic and confusing, and that sudden information, coupled with the embarassement I felt with all the boys in the room joking and being grossed out literally made me vomit and cry. In my family the conversation was pretty limited. Both my mother and father tried to be positive and supportive about it, yet seemed to want to end the conversation quickly. I felt like I went through it pretty much alone because of that and would only talk to my mother about it if I was really scared about something. I'd love to have had the relationship back then (that I do have now) where it was just a normal conversational topic.",1
"Is being ""Cis"" a priviledge?","I had a discussion with my friend, she told me ""cis priviledge"" doesn't exist.

What's your local music scene like? What are your experiences?,"I suppose this is more of a pre-pandemic question, but how would you describe the music scene in your area? Are there other feminists? Are promoters clear about their stance on abuse and harassment, and do venues have safer space policies? Are there people who initiate or attempt restorative justice after something has happened?

I was involved in the local punk/metal scene for almost 10 years and was on the receiving end of misogynistic bullshit from both men and women. Hating on women for how much sex they had and what kind of sex they had was the norm, and it was very much a huge clique. People talked shit about other women behind their back then would turn around and be super friendly to them at shows‚Äîit was sickening. 

One white woman would make comments to me, a eurasian femme, about how small my tits were, and how she could never not shave her pits like me, or not remove her upper lip hair, all the while holding events for ""women supporting women."" 

I was touched inappropriately countless times at events and would post about it on social media, telling people to keep their hands to themselves.  Others did this too. It seemed like every six months there was some musician being called out for being abusive, but nothing changed. 

One prominent metal promoter never spoke up about how harassment wouldn't be tolerated at his events, nor attempted to implement a safer spaces policy. In fact, he still supported a band even after the lead singer had groped a woman at a show of his. I guess it's not surprising behaviour considering he played in a band with a rapist.

I had to remove myself from the scene entirely. It's super disappointing to love a particular genre of music but be driven out of a community for it's hatred toward women and bro-code culture.",1
Is it appropriate to compliment a woman at the beach?,"I was talking to my boyfriend earlier cause he brought up the subject, we were talking about complimenting women in public, he said if he saw a woman on the beach and thought she was good looking (and wasn‚Äôt dating me) he thinks it‚Äôs appropriate to go up to her and tell her she looks good. I told him if I was at the beach in a bikini and some guy I don‚Äôt know came up to me and complimented my body I would be very uncomfortable. He said if it‚Äôs in a public place (including the beach) then it‚Äôs okay, I said I would feel uncomfortable if I‚Äôm wearing bathers, I should be able to go to the beach and wear bathers without being looked at and commented on. If I‚Äôm at the beach and everyone else is in bathers I‚Äôm good with that but once I‚Äôve been singled out by a stranger I feel vulnerable and uncomfortable.

He also asked if a woman came up to me and complimented me how would I feel and I said I‚Äôd be fine with that, he said that‚Äôs unfair and that women can be just as dangerous as men to other women, I said sure, but it‚Äôs a whole lot less likely so I‚Äôm comfortable with it.

"Informed Consent matters, why aren't minors who lie about their age considered rapists?","Informed Consent is an important factor of consent that both parties know what they're getting into and who they're getting intimate with. Someone who had sex with someone under the pretenses of a condom being present, did not consent to sex with the condom secretly off. Likewise for impersonation of another person.

The issue of a minor lying to get with an adult they're attracted to is an issue for adults of all genders and sexual orientations. Gay men and lesbian women also suffer from this issue as there are [reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/j8z9qs/psa_dont_lie_about_your_age_i_almost_hooked_up/) about it being an issue on their respective dating apps as well.

In these cases the adult consented to sex with someone who they believed to be an adult, they would not have had sex with the minor otherwise. Adults who are victim to this genuinely feel sickened and violated that they were manipulated into having sex with a child, an entirely different persona than the one presented.

The adult did not have informed consent, so why is a lying minor absolved of rape? From a feminist perspective, would lying about age dramatically changing one's personhood from minor to adult, violate informed consent?",1
Workplace Advice,"I have read the rules to advice and hope that I have followed them correctly.

Additionally, I share an office with him and have asked that he keep his side clean.

I‚Äôve grown out my hair for multiple weeks, occasionally even a couple of months, and felt good about it; really good about it. 

No matter how long I go and how proud I am of my beautiful hair, there is always something that makes me feel that I need to shave.

Is it inappropriate to note someone's pronouns before using them if you think they would cause confusion?,"There is a person in my extended social circle who uses he/her pronouns.  This can cause a modest amount of confusion for people who don't usually interact with him, as when we talk about her and he goes from the subject to the direct object of a sentence, people think that the ""her"" we are referring to is a different person.

This has lead to a weird situation in which we've found it helpful to clarify the ""he/her pronoun"" situation before talking about this person, but others have objected saying that it's kind of rude since we would never go out of our way to mention someone else's pronouns instead of just using them naturally.

I know feminist circles tend to have a good sense of the best practices with regards to pronoun usage, so I was wondering if anyone here has come across a similar situation, and if so, how did you approach it?",1
What do you think of this news? Do you agree with the government or not?,"Paris city authorities have been fined for employing too many women in senior positions, a decision mocked as ""absurd"" by mayor Anne Hidalgo on Tuesday. The **fine of 90,000 euros**(US$110,000) was demanded by France's public service ministry on the grounds that Paris city hall had broken national rules on gender parity in its 2018 staffing.

""I am happy to announce that we have been fined,"" Hidalgo told a city council meeting, adding she had been filled with ""joy"" when she learned of the penalty.

**Hidalgo said she was faulted because 11 women and only five men were named to management positions in city hall in 2018, meaning that 69 percent of the appointments went to women.**

""The management of the city hall has, all of a sudden, become far too feminist,"" laughed the Socialist, who was re-elected for a new term at the helm of Paris last year. According to the text of the ruling cited by Le Monde daily, city hall violated a rule dating to 2013, which stipulates said one sex should not account for more than 60 of nominations to management positions. Hidalgo said that she would take the cheque for the fine to the government in person, along with her deputy mayors and all the women working for her.

Taking a more serious tone, she added: ""Thi**s fine is obviously absurd, unfair, irresponsible and dangerous**"", adding that women in France should be promoted with ""vigour because the lag everywhere in France is still very great"".

""Yes, **to one day achieve parity, we must speed up the tempo and ensure that more women are appointed than men**,"" she said",1
Is Toy Story a good allegory for the loss of privilege?,"I know it isn't a perfect 1-to-1 because ultimately Andy is trading one masculine symbol for another buuuut in regards to Woody it seems actually pretty fitting.

He's Andy's favorite. He is the basis and hero in all of Andy's stories. The other toys are but a part of his story and their importance is only in relation to how much they serve that purpose. He gets more representation than anyone else as Andy's room is full of his merch. So he will naturally walk around secure in the knowledge that he'll be okay.

What's your view of single-sex schools? Why are they legal?,"Hi :)

I'm from the UK and we have many more same sex schools than across the pond, but I've never really understood why tf we have them. I've always hated them -  there not representative of the real world and your at risk of producing some really weird personalities that are alienated from the real world (particularly private same-sex schools) - and I've always assumed that feminists hate them too, given feminism is all about sex equality. It's weird because it's literally segregation so I don't really see a moral case for them, but I'd really like to know if there are any feminists (or anyone at all, for that matter) who genuinely agrees with them. And what's really baffling to me, is how they are legal?? In the UK, we have the Equality Act 2010, which reads  'A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if, because of a protected characteristic, A treats B less favourably than A treats or would treat others. '  Now if I'm not wrong, don't same-sex schools do literally what's described there e.g I can't go to an all-girls school because I'm male, and sex is a protected characteristic so...? I know in the US you have your constitution, and surely US same-sex schools (albeit the small amount) are unconstitutional - 'all men (bit dodgy, but I'm interpreting it as everyone) are created equal'. So, particularly any lawyers out there, how are they legal/constitutional? Is there an exemption or some weird loophole?  


I'm genuinely interested in any answers to both of my questions, so any responses would be much appreciated :) Thanks",1
Some advice about how to deal with men purporting to be feminists.,"I‚Äôm close friends with a woman whose husband has been physically, emotionally and sexually abusive for the vast majority of their relationship. To meet the man, you‚Äôd never suspect he‚Äôs capable of such awful things, he‚Äôs charming and funny, most people seem to like him. 

He‚Äôs also a vocal supporter of feminism and likes to tell anyone who‚Äôll listen how progressive and open minded he is. 

What I‚Äôm curious about is if anyone has had similar experiences, and how you‚Äôve  decided to deal with that? 

Is it common that people might profess such liberal views publicly, and act against them so disgustingly in private? 

The whole situation has left me wondering what to do about the type of person who has taken on the persona of an ally in order to hide their true nature. 

In the meantime I‚Äôm trying to help my friend as best I can, to find a way to deal with the situation they live in.

Where does your moral compass point?,"A guy I was dating recently asked to stay at my house and made comments, essentially that he would probably be irritable if he gets erect and that it would be uncomfortable for him to sleep like that.

He later sent me a Facebook post from a feminist page ,stating he found it funny. ‚ÄúBlue balls is a personal problem‚Äù and explaining how it‚Äôs a mans responsibility to handle himself and no one else‚Äôs for that matter.

He thought it would be funny to show me as we had a similar conversation on this topic. I asked how it was funny because he had literally behaved the way it described as manipulative and predatory.

what should I do if I recently realized that I disagree with a lot of what feminists say?,"I usually would think about myself as being a democrat, even a socialist, and agree with many liberal ideas. But, deep in my heart, I do not agree with much of what feminists say, even though I say nothing about it, it is still strong enough to vote the other way.

It is not because I have not been self critical, or have not reflected about my own biases.

I disagree about the full spectrum of what privilege means, and I cannot find myself upholding standpoint epistemology. I take on my own emotions, and I have gone to therapy.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, I am saying that, even after deep introspection, I do not agree with many points in feminism beyond these ideas, but that is not really the point. My question is, how does feminism address the existence of someone like me?

&amp;#x200B;

edit 2:

I am asking whether it is even possible to give the benefit of the doubt. whether democracy can work. I am questioning standpoint epistemology. I am wondering if communication is possible.

I do not want to get into the arguments. because, this is besides the real point, and I don't want to get into people flinging trauma at each other either. the point is, I am introspective. I am educated. I have gone to therapy. But I disagree.

It is a problem I myself am wrestling with. a problem of commensurability. a problem of censorship. a problem of being able to participate in civic space.

What is the response to this? Because if we can't figure this out, and we go on as we are, in society... water wars, will not just be between india and china.

I want to be on the side of democracy. But it seems as though it is not working. as with Kalithecat's response, I think it was Simone Veil that said something like ""recognition is the rarest form of compassion""

edit: 

nobody has even addressed the problem with standpoint epistemology. ",1
How do I deal with my ex wanting to date women?,"Hello, I identify as male with he/him pronouns, and a few months ago my ex broke up with me because she felts like she wanted to start seeing women. It was certainly difficult to leave, but if that's what makes her happy than I support her efforts. You only have one life, right? However, as time went on I've felt sort of scared of the idea of seeing her with someone else. I know that we're over and she wants to explore her sexuality and all this stuff, but I keep thinking of scenarios where we would hang out, and then she'd find someone, and it would be very awkward. I'm scared this awkward feeling is homophobia. If she were to start dating a woman, I'd think it would be hard for me to get used to the idea right away. I've never had a problem with people who have sexualities outside of the heteronormative practice, nor ever felt any animosity towards them. And I still love my ex very much, as both a human being and my best friend. I keep vacillating between whether my feelings are valid or not, and if they are prejudicial in nature. I keep wondering if its a result of implicit bias that makes me uncomfortable. If this is a case of homophobia, I want to do whatever it takes to get over it because I still want to be her friend, no matter the workload and harsh truths that I will have to go through. Its difficult to know their is a prejudicial side to myself, but I know prejudices can be overcome and my relationships will be much more closer because of it. I just find it difficult to accept my ex being with someone else while I still would like to be her friend. How should I think about this situation, and what can I do?",1
Slut-shaming other women - how do you react?,"A short backstory: Recently I have watched some videos on YouTube why feminism is still needed. I have been always aware that women around the world are treated unequally. However, as a young teenager living in Europe, I somehow though that there is no discrimination towards women in my country, at least in my environment. Oh boy, I was so wrong on so many levels.

But what recently caught my attention was how people treat women who are promiscuous. 

The first time that I really thought about this aspect was when I was around 16 years old. There was this ‚Äúconservative‚Äù female friend who was telling me about party she went to during weekend. She simply slut-shamed one girl just ‚Äúbecause she went with a random boy alone to the bedroom‚Äù. I really felt that what she said was inappropriate and disrespectful. Firstly, she didn‚Äôt know what they were doing. Secondly, it‚Äôs still none of her business. And thirdly, she named this girl ‚Äúa whore‚Äù while not mentioning the boy at all. Back then I couldn‚Äôt really understand why I was so upset by her words. Now I know it is the fact that she used such words to describe other girl, only because she potentially could have made out with someone. 

What is even more worrying, I know many girls from my school who claim themselves to be feminists and to fight for women‚Äôs rights. The problem is their attitude towards other females who are promiscuous. I‚Äôve heard many times as they said -  ‚Äúshe is slutty‚Äù or ‚Äúshe‚Äôs whore‚Äù. As long as you don‚Äôt do harm to the other person (meaning someone didn‚Äôt force themselves or didn‚Äôt cheat on somebody), I don‚Äôt understand the need for calling other women in such way. 

Two year later, I remember being on parties in which there was a particular boy who liked to flirt with other girls. Each time there was a party, he would get drunk and try to make out with someone. I didn‚Äôt think of it much as I believe it is none of my business. However, several weeks after one party he told how one girl was slutty (she and him were only kissing each other). I laughed in my mind because I couldn‚Äôt believe what he had just said. It was fine for him to call a female in a harmful manner, while he‚Äôs doing the same thing on every party. It was sheer hypocrisy, and this was the moment that I realized women are certainly not treated the same way that men are, even in those smallest aspects of social life. 

No one would call a male being slutty but rather as a player etc. Somehow for males being promiscuous equals to being successful (and btw I think that it‚Äôs toxic too). But when a female is promiscuous, she is described with extremely negative words. It is worrying that not only males make such comments, but women too, even though we are supposed to support each other. 

I have questions to you. Have you experienced situations in which promiscuous females were treated or talked in a negative way? How did you respond? How do you react to people who talk this way?

I think this issue is quite important because calling a female ‚Äúa slut‚Äù can drastically changer her change, especially for teenagers who are entering some part of adulthood.",1
What is feminism (to high school boys),"Straight dude here, and proud member of my high school‚Äôs feminism club.

I would like to add these are cases in which the joke/ remark actually was offensive, rather than grey area. 


I see two issues:

1. Possibly women not being honest with male friends / family members and claiming to be okay with things they aren‚Äôt okay with. 

2. The unfortunate belief that a women can‚Äôt be a misogynist or sexist because she is a women. 

I wonder if the men using these excuses genuinely believe ‚Äúoh a women has said it‚Äôs okay therefore it is‚Äù, or if it‚Äôs just that, an excuse that sounds more credible, a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù? 
Are misogynistic women actually more of an issue than we like to believe? Or are these women simply people who are too anxious to speak up around their male friends or partners? (I can imagine it‚Äôs not always easy to tell people what they‚Äôve said isn‚Äôt right)",1
Is criticizing terf women's opinions wrong?,"There was this post in Facebook of someone defending a mysoginistic woman who is also a famous youtuber.

I don't think this behavior is acceptable, but this person was saying that our feminism should defend these aggressors, this woman as well. That this is sorority. So I made a comment about this not being okay, and I receive tons of comments saying that I should respect this opinion, that I'm attacking this woman by saying that her opinion is bullshit. 

So if I don't get terf opinions, do you think is wrong if I decide to criticize them?

How to change parents views on their daughters? (I am male homeroom/science teacher),"So I have been working in a girls-only school for the last three years. And now that I have direct communication with the student's families, I understand how incomplete is to work on body-positivity, sexual rights, promotion towards STEM fields, or prevention of violence with the girls if the families are pulling the other way around. I will put an example to make myself clear: in one teacher-parents meeting, I shared my worries on emotional  health of the student and one of the mother's replies was that it is o that the girl's worries about her body, because she was getting fatter. Or in this other meeting another mother ""denounced"" how the other ""sluts"" of her daughter's grade were already having sex (they are 16 y/o). 

Mostly this type of situation happens with the mothers of my students (mothers are usually the caregivers of my students and the one to go to the school to talk with me, because ""dad's working for proving to the house"" ) , which makes thing twice complicated. I mean,  I feel I have to intervene so how, but those are their daughters, but the violences is there, but I feel I am mansplainning feminist theory to an adult female (the mothers).  So, any advice?

Shouldn‚Äôt masturbating / fantasizing about someone require consent? [LONG READ],"A NOTE ON CONTENT: Nothing sexually graphic is mentioned, though there is discussion of sexual activities and consent. 

**TL;DR - When someone other than yourself is involved in a sexual act with you, that other person must provide consent. Masturbation is a sexual act. Masturbation fantasies involve a person other than yourself (albeit indirectly) in the sexual act of masturbating. Since there is another person involved in a sexual act, shouldn‚Äôt that person give their consent to be masturbated to / fantasized about?**


Full disclosure: I‚Äôm a cishet male. My own understanding on consent is limited and still growing, and I think this is one of the best places to ask. If there‚Äôs other places on Reddit or the internet that such a question would be better directed, please let me know, and I apologize in advance if I‚Äôve crossed any lines. 


EDIT: I‚Äôve looked at other posts on this subreddit and just thought I‚Äôd clarify this from the start: I‚Äôm not talking about masturbating to photos or videos of people but just fantasizing about them to yourself. Masturbating to pictures, if those pictures were not taken with the explicit intention of providing a template for sexual fantasy, is an act of objectification and is thus inherently demeaning. My question just regards fantasizing and masturbating to oneself, no pictures or any other materials present, and the extent that consent should apply. 

With that said:

[Healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/health/guide-to-consent#what-is-consent) has, what I think to be, a sufficient definition of consent, that is ‚ÄúConsent is a voluntary, enthusiastic, and clear agreement between the participants to engage in specific sexual activity.‚Äù 

Further, I understand masturbation to be an inherently sexual act (and I think others would agree with me on this stance). 

Masturbation is also an activity that often, if not always, leads to fantasizing about someone in a sexual manner. Because masturbating is an act of self-stimulated orgasm, by definition, the person being fantasized about during masturbation not be *directly* involved in the act itself. That is, the person being fantasized about is not physically causing nor stimulating the orgasm. **However**, they are still *involved* in the act, are they not? Their involvement is indirect, in the form of being fantasized and thought about during masturbation, rather than physical involvement, but it‚Äôs involvement nonetheless, right? 

**With that in mind, since masturbation is a sexual act that involves another person, shouldn‚Äôt the other person have to consent to be masturbated to / fantasized about (as per the definition of consent)?**

I‚Äôve read stances along the lines of ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre masturbating to them, then it‚Äôs alright.‚Äù But then again, what if someone were masturbating to someone else in a public space, without the subject of the masturbation knowing they were in the center of someone‚Äôs fantasy? Though the person doesn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre being masturbated to, surely such an act violates consent since the subject‚Äôs lack of awareness of the situation prevents any consent from being given?

Now, I‚Äôd just like to personally add that I‚Äôm asking tjis question because I‚Äôve masturbated to both people I know, and celebrities that I find attractive. Yet, regardless of if I know them or not, I do not want to deprive them of their consent, even if they don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm masturbating to them. I try not to masturbate to any pictures that I find on the internet, as most of the time such images were not taken with the intention of providing a source of sexual fantasy, and I don‚Äôt want to reduce their identities by disregarding the photo‚Äôs intent and looking at it only in a sexual light. Any fantasizing is kept to myself, though, again, even if it is kept to myself, I don‚Äôt want to deprive anyone of consent with my actions. 

Thank you for reading and any an all responses are appreciated.

EDIT 2: To be honest, I was expecting this to get no comments. So even the few I‚Äôve received I‚Äôm very grateful for, and all with incredible insights. Thank you all!",1

Misuse of verbage.,"Why is it that on most pages or posts involving feminism, the terms misogyny, sexist, oppressed, etc. are all used either incorrectly or simply as an attack on any males who dont agree?    (Im not saying all feminists are like this, i just tend to see alot of them).",1
Are the events of 2020 throwing us into the fourth wave of feminism?,"As far as I understand, basically: first wave is suffragists around 1910-1920, second wave is around 1960-1970 with the womens lib movement, third wave is 1990s(ish?) with more intersectionality, and the only thing ive heard about fourth wave is that its pretty much the same as third wave but with social media? 

At first I thought if its the same how does adding social media make a whole new wave when we already had the internet when the third wave started? I know social media has had a strong affect on our society both good and bad. Is it because of the #s? #metoo and #blm are obviously very important in as historical social movements

But now in 2020 we are kinda forced to use only internet based/social media platforms during quarantine? So Im thinking that fourth wave might be a more relevant label for whats happening currently after coronavirus.

I also want to acknowledge the fact that I'm in the US, my historical knowledge and current situation is based on that. In other countries apparently its like the pandemic never even happened haha.",1
Where to stand on women that men cheat with?,"To me personally, if the woman didn‚Äôt know, then the man who cheated is definitely solely to blame.  If she knew, then I go as per the saying ‚Äúit takes two to tango.‚Äù  As the saying literally means that-they both dug their grave.  

Blaming *only* the woman (or multiple women) in either instance while letting the man who cheated off scot free is no doubt internalized misogyny (hello Cardi B).  However, despite that being the common case for long, I am at odds with the idea that the woman a man cheated with should be scot free even if she knew because she didn‚Äôt owe the man‚Äôs gf/wife a commitment.  I‚Äôd argue she still owed the gf/wife basic decency/courtesy and empathy/consideration.  

I also don‚Äôt believe feminism means excusing selfish behavior of individual women.  Plus, in instances where the gf/wife knew the other women well, it‚Äôs understandable that she feels betrayed by both her bf/husband and the other woman.  In my experience, women who knowingly engage in affairs with other women‚Äôs bfs/husbands tend to have the most internalized misogyny along with all other sorts of bigotry (personally my own stepmother is a prime example).  

I‚Äôve seen different feminists have different views on this, so I‚Äôd like to see where the feminists of Reddit stand.",1

Now the police will arrive and haul the targeted parent out of the matrimonial home with protective orders, offering scant access to immediate legal recourse.

Is Grayson a non sexist way of doing power fantasy/spy fiction?,"Hey I want to write a spy story and most of my influences come from Bond.  And I'm kinda realizing how problematic that is.  But I've recently read Grayson which I'm thinking I can draw from a bit less problematicly?


Like the issue with Bond is:

The use of Bond Girls as just eye candy with no characterization 

His treatment of said women 

The lack of female rep until like Quantum of Solace

The racist and homophobic caricatures of the villains ect.

Probably some transphobia there too

Alot of imperialism 



I dont think Grayson has any of that and hope to God I dont write any in, but is it a better place to draw spy fiction from, especially escapist spy fiction.

Also the sex between characters is that better suited?

Like what's a better way to write no strings sex or a better view of sex in spy fiction in general?

Arguments to support believing victim.,"My high school had a MeToo recently. Many boys getting called out did not sit well with most of the male population. Their foremost argument, as always, was that anyone can make allegations without evidence. Most of the posts were self anecdotal cases. There were a few anonymous posts as well where someone would send first or second hand accounts, the poster will label them as such. While discussing the whole thing with my friends, the arguments that I brought up for believing the victims were:

*  No. of false allegations as a percentage is so small you can ignore it, especially if you take into account the number of cases that go unreported.
* You can't prove a lot of cases as there is no hard evidence but that doesn't mean the victim is lying. I gave the analogy that if I'm alone with one of you and I hit you hard without leaving any marks. You go complain to the authorities, who ask for evidence which you can't provide so you're obviously lying. Do you see the issue? How difficult it is to always produce evidence? Then there's also the mishandling of evidence.
* Victims have a lot to deal with when calling someone out. Recalling might trigger unpleasant memories. They have to face societal pressure. They are slut shamed. They are called liars and attention seekers. They are gaslight. They got more to lose than gain by falsely accusing someone for personal benefit so highly unlikely someone will suffer all that.
* ""Anyone can bring up an allegation against me"" To which I said, if you haven't done anything, you shouldn't be worried. Nobody has falsely accused me or you guys means they aren't on some sort of agenda to defame all men.

After a few posts, anonymous posts were stopped as the authenticity of such posts couldn't be completely determined and a few doubtful cases did slip in so the girls said they won't be taking anonymous posts, even though it does silence those who want to remain anonymous, as they can't do due diligence. These cases were used to bring up the whole false allegations argument and counter victim having to lose as they were behind a virtual wall now.

1) What other reasons can I provide to further bolster my argument? If anyone of the reasons I provided above are problematic, please explain how to correct them.

2) What are your views on anonymous posting? Should they have continued to be allowed despite the authenticity issue? 

3) Many boys argued that judgement was already passed without allowing the accused to defend themselves. Should the accused be allowed present their defence? 

4) In some cases, the accused provided very private conversations and digital evidence in their defence. Many argued that is a violation of privacy of the victim, while others said the accused have a right to defend. Views on this (I personally agree with the former)?

5) Extending (4), there was one particular case where a guy was accused on an all girls group but the whole student body got to know about it. He posted above type of evidence in the bigger group. The argument against this was that since the victim never posted on the bigger group, he shouldn't have either. His defence was that doesn't matter as everyone already knew by then. Can his reason be justified?

6) A bit unrelated to the post, but I read that we should call victims, survivors instead. I have seen the use of the term 'victim' here, so what to understand if it's okay to use it?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, please suggest some reading materials related to the MeToo movement, to understand it from the victim's perspective.",1

Allegedly there is a sort of loophole in that it is somewhat easy to get a  medical certificate from your doctor to get it done anyway, but this requires you to go and say that you feel either physically or emotionally impaired by your genitalia.

It's also important to point out that even without this law, FGM would still be completely illegal due to other laws against mutilation, which also would prevent anyone from getting their testicles or hands cut off regardless of their age and claims of consent.",1

Interrupting Harassment,"I'm a white man in the USA and slightly larger than the average american man (whether or not this matters, I'm not sure). In general, what's the most effective to interrupt a man harassing a woman when I don't know either party? Of course, I want to defuse the situation, not escalate it. And, clearly rule number one isn't then to expect that same woman to fall head over heels for me because I ""protected her."" (That was mostly me being mad at pop culture).

Getting married/Having a child as a feminist?,"Hi all,

I am a feminist with a radical leaning and also an environmentalist. I am in my early 30s and about to get married (humanist elopement) to my SO. I never dreamt of getting married nor having children, even before I identified as a feminist. I am still not 100 % sure about why I am getting married as I am also not religious (surprise, surprise) but I guess it's because my partner asked and I am willing to make this commitment to him. I am not taking his last name though.

As mentioned I have almost zero desire to have kids. Pregnancy, child birth, losing my independence, climate change, feeling like I'd be conforming to patriarchal ideas of what it means to be a woman etc.  just make me extremely reluctant to having a child. But then there is a tiny part that thinks what if I'll regret it? It doesn't help that historically I am the kind of person who just really hates conforming and likes to rebel - the more people talk to me about having children and how that will give me purpose and meaning (I have an extremely purposeful and meaningful career and helping the planet is more important to me than perpetuating my genes), the more I will dig my heels in.

I am aware that feminism is about giving women the choice to do what they feel is best and I rather dislike the fact I am so antagonistic toward motherhood.

So feminists of r/askfeminists what are your feminist perspectives on motherhood and reproduction?",1
"The ""divorce financially destroys men"" myth - where did it come from?","I still see the idea that divorce financially ruins men (and the implication: it doesn't hurt women) come up *a lot* despite the data showing that [men are financially better off after divorce than women are.](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/25/divorce-women-research) People seem to treat it as some sort of conventional wisdom without any evidence to support it. To be honest, divorce sucks for a lot of people, but the financial aspect does not disproportionately impact men; the opposite is true. 

So where do you think this whole trope comes from?

Oh, and the other thing that's always thrown around: ""The man loses half of his stuff in divorce!"" Like... that's not how it works. Joint assets in the marriage are divided. Not just ""his stuff."" Not just ""her stuff."" It's like some men fail to see marriage as a partnership at all.

I am misogynist for stopping my gf from meeting certain men?,"The reason I chose to post this question here rather than an advice subreddit is that I want to understand if my thinking stems from misogyny, which I doubt I'll be able to understand there.

To give you some context, my gf is a very friendly and kind women. She manages to see good in people who don't even deserve an ounce of kindness. Over the years, I've stopped her from going to some events, like going out for drinks with co-workers where no other girl is present, and meeting certain guy friends/co-workers alone.

The reason behind this isn't that I'm insecure, there are a few guy friends of hers that I can blindly trust to not hurt her. Even if they have feelings for her doesn't mean she feels the same and will end up cheating on me. I don't fear her catching feelings for someone else, if that's going to happen then though luck for me but the mature thing is to accept that people fall out of love and forcing someone to love you is toxic. Besides, since I love her, I'd want what makes her happy, not miserable.

I tell her not go to these things or meet these men for her safety. Given how rampant harassment and violence against women are, I fear her getting hurt. Even if she takes care of her self, these men can take advantage of her, spike her drink, force her, physically overpower her. I don't stop her from going out in general, even if at night, or even with some guys I trust as I aforementioned. I won't say the only way to stop harassment/violence is to not go out, that's not a solution. It's just better to avoid certain people you think can hurt you. Moreover, it's just certain men that I think are creepy that I don't want her meeting alone, heck, I'd trust strangers more. I'd be okay with her chilling with them if, say, I am around or some of our trustable guy/girl friends are.

I don't forcibly stop her, ~~I just tell her not to go and she listens~~ (I tell her these people aren't good based on the evidence I give for the claim. She agrees with how that is indeed bad. I am well aware she can go if she wants to and won't stop her.

Recently I was explaining the same to a friend of hers who said that my reasons stem from a misogynistic way of thinking as I am another guy trying to control his female partner.

Edit: correct title should start with ""am I"". Currently it looks like I am been sarcastic.

Edit2: changed some wording which made it look like I was commanding her.

Edit3: I am going to set away now. Despite my post not being able to properly explain what I was trying to say, I did see some issues being highlighted in the comments that I was missing. I will reflect on those. Thank you for your responses! ",1
Question regarding boundaries and other people's kink,"I was just reading a post on AITA about a girl whose mother would wear a BDSM collar and call her husband ""Sir"" in front of her throughout her childhood, and the mom recently informed the daughter (20) that this was part of a Dominant/Submissive lifestyle. The daughter was repulsed to learn about her parents kink and felt that her boundaries have been violated. Most of the commenters were calling her an asshole for kink shaming her mom. 

I don't know how I feel about this situation because to me it seems like the parents were exposing their child to  their kink without her consent, especially after the daughter found out the signification of the collar and express extreme discomfort with it. That being said, some commenters were comparing it to a wedding ring, saying the kink is not inherently sexual. I'm wondering what you guys think is the line between respecting people's boundaries, vs respecting people's freedom to express their lifestyle.

(I know this isn't a specifically feminist issue, but since sexual consent is often discussed here I thought I'd ask)",1
How can a guy convince his fiancee not take his name?,"So, I have a buddy who is engaged to be married and he believes that it is oppressive a woman to take her husbands name. 

He feels strongly about it and im not sure that there's anything that can change his mind on the issue.

The problem is that his fiancee absolutely wants to take his last name and is offended by the suggestion that they should each keep their family names. Apparently, she had a mug custom made with the words Mrs. [His name] printed on it. 

From my understanding, she is a die hard feminist. So it's super confusing that she would want to take his name. 


Anyways. I can't seem to come up with any arguments for why they should keep their own names besides the ones that he has already offered to her. 

He doesn't like the history of the practice and what it represents. I've suggested that he offer to take hers but he likes his last name and doesn't want to change it.  He's also is kind of a stickler for fairness and thinks that it is unfair for one spouse to take the others as it creates a ""Power imbalance"". 

I don't understand relationships in general. So I'm making the smart decision and looking to Reddit for answers lol

Any advice on how a man can convince his fiancee that it's not right for her to change her name to his?

Some questions.,"Is it okay to accept an engagement ring from a man which he has paid for? And to live in a house that is completely paid for by the man, and have the privilege to take the whole house in case of divorce. If the man also hires and pays for a housekeeper \[thereby eliminating the unpaid labor \] in that case isn't marriage a system only beneficial for women?

Then, are pre-nups offensive to women \[Statistically it is women who almost exclusively practice hypergamy, so only a small percentage of women would be richer than their males spouse\]?

If there are such extreme failings on part of men, why don't women start dating women and marrying women, since feminism says that sexuality is a spectrum? I mean, why spend so much time crticising and analysing things instead of becoming bisexual, nobody is stopping you from doing that now.  Also women would know how to pleasure other women better and since penetrative sex does not guarantee female orgasm, so wouldn't you be better off with a woman?

Also, why do you think asian countries don't care about feminism?",1
"Why should I not be offended by the statement ""I've got 99 problems and the white heteronormative patriarchy is basically all of them""?","My feminist sisters are frequently posting this sort of thing on their Facebook stories and news feeds and I am told that I'm not supposed to take this personally. Being that I am white, straight, and male, I don't see how I could take this as anything other than a personal insult.

Why don't we have stricter penalties for rape?,"Increasing prison time will bring down the number of rapes, as men will be more afraid of committing rapes and going to jail for a long time. I think some countries also have death penalty for rape? Some Islamic countries cut off arms or something - but they also oppress women so we should not follow them.

Also, I am curious about difference between rape culture and like murder culture? . Obviously like making punishment severe will bring number of rapes down, but can we completely eradicate it? \[Like even in advanced countries people still commit murder even if jail time is very high\].",1
"What, as a feminist, is your view on NSFW games?","I have found myself playing a lot of lewd/erotic visual novel games lately. I've realized that most of them are terrible, but there are a few that actually have a very fleshed-out story and interesting characters on top of the sexual content.

Diversity and Entertainment.,"I do not understand why people want to force diversity everywhere?  Like just recently with Netflix's Winx Club adaptation - they do not even look like teenagers. . Also other things too like Enola Holmes \[why ride on the coat tails of an already iconic character? Arthur Conan Doyle did not mention an Enola?\] Like create your own female detective or something instead of marring Sherlock Holmes legacy \[I think the Doyle estate have sued Netflix\]. 

Like, actors/entertainers are paid so much because they act in works of fiction that allow you to move away from the boring realities of life, so I think it made logical sense that so many people in the entertainment industry were extremely good looking. Because otherwise - why the hell would I pay money to look at people who look exactly like me and behave exactly like I am - I already am living that life.

I think the next step would be to pay fat salaries to the people graduating at the bottom of the class then, because if rewarding genetic gift of beauty is problematic, it would be hypocritical of human society to reward the genetic gift of intelligence?

Why does feminism require one to be anti-racist?,"All feminism says is that men and women should be treated equally. It says absolutely nothing about treating all races equally.

Of course, most people would consider such a person deeply immoral, but I don't see how their racism makes them less of a feminist.",1
Does intersectional feminism mean that conservatives like me aren't allowed to be feminists?,"I am a Trump/Brexit/Le Pen supporting type, and also very sympathetic to feminism.  But every time I read feminists online, they seem to keep saying that I'm not allowed to be a feminist, because you can only be a feminist if you believe in radical left-wing social politics, multi-culturalism, etc.

For German speakers, I refer you to this speech:

"" [Teresa B√ºcker √ºber eine feministische Zukunft | 05.02.2020 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyIs3UoUVs) ""

Literally the first line is, ""we can't have anything to do with the AfD or other right-wing parties"", and the general theme is that in order to be a feminist, you have to be left-wing.

This article describes French feminists disavowing Marine Le Pen, saying that she is not allowed to support feminism because she's a fascist:

"" ['We feel very close to her': can 'fake feminist' Marine Le Pen win the female vote? | Marine Le Pen | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/18/front-national-anger-marine-le-pen-female-supporters) ""

I believe that sexual abuse and domestic violence etc are evil and widespread crimes and want to support feminist campaigns against them, but I don't feel able to do so because feminists seem to say that you can't be against those things unless you also support open borders, amnesty for illegals, Remaining in the EU, BLM, anti-capitalism, etc.  So what does that mean?  Am I forbidden from being a feminist?

I think that this is really dangerous.  It seems to me very dangerous to link the campaign against, for example, sexual abuse (which I'm personally a survivor of) with partisan, sectarian politics like immigration/anti-racism - because this is simply a terrible human evil which, like slavery or child labour, every sane person in society should be against.  But it sounds like contemporary feminists demand absolute compliance with a radical left-wing way of thinking as a precondition for supporting any feminist campaigns, like opposition to rape culture and abuse (which is an issue which affects men, too).  So does this mean I can't be against rape?

So what does this mean?  Am I banned from supporting #MeToo because I'm a rightie?  Do I have to oppose equal pay for women?  It sounds like this is what you keep saying to me.",1

So, what is the right thing to do if you have to interact with someone who wears revealing clothes without offending them?

Male Privilege &amp; Sexual Harassment,"Serious question here...no trolling.  My wife is telling me that sexual harassment is part of male privilege.  That does not seem correct to me.  My understanding is that male privilege is about rights that are available to men solely on the basis of their sex, while sexual harassment is not a privilege but an unlawful act.

Should the Age of consent be raised to 21?,"I saw a concerning post on r/feminism about older men targeting high school girls at 16/17 for a relationship. But unfortunately based on where you live this may not be considered illegal. And teens at that age do not have their brains fully developed and can be easily manipulated. In fact the human brain develops till you are around 24. 

Keeping that in mind would it be a good idea to raise the age of consent to protect men from manipulating young women? There is no problem if there are exemptions for near age relationships at around 18-21. 

I would also like to note that South Korea has their age of consent at 20",1
New Army PT test and the negative effects it could have on women,"So some background, I'm 19 years old am a male and I'm in the Army. Now from my definitely brief time in the Army so far I've seen terrible male soldiers and excellent female soldiers, and vice versa. I really do believe that both have equal ability to be combat effective and I would ""go to war"" with whoever is next to me. The Army recently started a new pt test that takes away all sex and age adjustments when it comes to your score. Essentially what that means is everyone has to reach the same numbers depending on the job you have. As of September 84% of females in the Army failed the test (passing is a requirement while in the Army). While 30% of males failed the test as well. The biggest events that females failed on was deadlift and leg tucks (essentially the weirdest mix of a situps and pullup you can imagine). The deadlift minimum requirement is 140 pounds and the minimum requirement for leg tucks is one rep.

All of that and now you're probably wondering what the heck is the point of this post. Well Army leadership, in all their genius, says that this test is superior because it takes everything out of the equation except for your preformance. People that oppose this test say it is extremely discriminatory towards women because of the high fail rates and how men are more likely to pass with less effort. They say it is sexism disguised as ""equal opportunity "". People that support the test say that it doesnt matter what your gender is, it only matters if you can do your job when it cpunts. And that equal opportunity does not always amount to equal results. They also say that these requirements are not difficult to meet and as an Army soldier it is a part of your job to meet what is required. 

This all boils down the question I have. I wanna get the feminist perspective of this issue. Do you think this test is inherently discriminatory towards women? Do you think lowering the standards for women could have even more negative outcomes? ( such as men thinking less of women because they changed the standards for them or something along those lines). Do you think it's more important to have an across the board standard or to adjust based off sex and age?

What are your perspectives on a contentious relationship and how it associates to patriarchy and feminism?,"In straight relationships some men claim that they are at a disadvantage because they feel that the woman has a lot of leverage. Chivalry causes some men to support women in a sexist manner. Whereas Feminism argues patriarchal ideals have put women in a disadvantaged position due oppression. 

This has led certain communities to be skeptical when men claim domestic violence and assume them to be the aggressor. Men worry that in a contentious moment in a relationship woman can essentially pull a DV card to get the men in trouble. 

I understand there are also many communities where the opposite is the case. Where traditional patriarchy has put women in a somewhat submissive position. Essentially treating them like servants. Women in a lot of communities still do an unfair amount of house work as shown by research?

 When women claim abuse they are ignored or their issues are minimized

I personally grew up in a male privileged patriarchal community. I do intend on standing against patriarchy and living in a more equal society. But I do hear a lot of men complaining about false allegations of DV and sexual assault. 

My question is, what is your perspective on this? Do you believe there are communities where men are at a disadvantage? Or do you believe that it‚Äôs rare? How does feminism solve this issue?

I understand that they want to see their issues addressed. They are important. Yet, a lot of time I'll see them addressing it is when a woman brings up her issues. And that makes it equally annoying when, yet again, I'm told that I don't advocate for men's issues enough.

Also disclaimer: This is not how all men/peeps act online, this is just based on what I see and my experiences. 

Anyways, I would love to hear any of y'all's experiences with this kind of situation, and/or how you dealt with it! And anything else would like to add! This is my first post and I'm so happy to see so many sisters/people like me who advocate for women's rights. &lt;3 much love!",1
"Hi, im a 17 year old girl, and wanted to start getting into reading feminist theory. I recently was on tiktok and saw a post about ‚Äúmale internal gaze‚Äù, and I think it sounds pretty interesting to read. Are there any books that speak on that specifically?",I hope this question made sense.,1
What is your opinion on Cyberpunk: 2077?,"As you might've heard, there's been... plenty of controversy surrounding CDPR's new game, Cyberpunk: 2077. From accusations of [transphobia](https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/12/18662443/cyberpunk-2077-trans-advertisement-cd-projekt-red-e3-2019), [misogyny](https://medium.com/@venus.shortfilm/the-representation-of-women-in-cyberpunk-eea332766a7a), to the fiasco surrounding [seizure-enducing visuals](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55231183), there's been a bit of everything.

So I wanted to open up the discussion, as I haven't seen one in here yet. What is your opinion on Cyberpunk: 2077? (This is meant to focus more on the game's messages, themes and social contexts, less on gameplay.)

My personal opinion (I bought it and I'm two hours in):

Transphobia: I'm not very well educated on trans issues, so I can't really comment too much. I do think that the point of the ""Mix It Up""-ad featuring a trans woman is to mock how companies use trans people in ads to show how ""woke"" they are, but fail horribly at it. There's been an interview with the artist, and I think she mentioned that the point was [similar to what I mentioned](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-06-12-a-conversation-with-the-artist-behind-that-cyberpunk-2077-poster). The ""did you just assume their gender!?"" joke made from the Cyberpunk 2077 Twitter account was dumb.

Misogyny: Not too sure about this one, haven't played much yet so I can't really form an opinion.

Epilepsy: They should just patch that imagery out honestly. I don't have epilepsy, but flashing images still make me uncomfortable.

There's probably more controversies, but these seemed to be the biggest ones.

As for gameplay: So far it's pretty fun, though there's bugs. Most visual ones I could fix by updating my GPU drivers. Gameplay bugs I haven't encountered any yet. The gunplay feels a bit odd though.",1
Favorite films (bonus if Spanish-language) dealing with themes of justice?,"Hey all! What are your favorite films that explore different ideas of justice or which critique existing models? What do they do well, and how have they shaped how you think about justice?

"On women, men, children, and safety: In what ways if any has being a woman made people feel less safe around you?","I'll be frank here. Took me a while to actually pin down what exact question was actually bubbling in my mind. Some context:

I am a 6'2 man. I enjoy going to the gym, I rock some well kept stubble. And I have a smile that makes my cats  mew mew mew.  I also love kids. I like making funny faces at em to make em laugh. I helped raised 4 of my cousins and often babysat growing up.  And one of my favorite things was taking em out to get toys, books, or ice cream. And they ask the most fascinating questions sometimes. Aaand I already feel a bit of unease as I wonder if some of you are asking ""well how much does he like kids?"" which sort of leads into my point.

The reality is that (some) men hurt women. Hurt kids. And it's more than enough to warrant taking precautions. I understand this. I have no desire to bring harm to anyone. But people around me don't know that. What they do know is that IF I wanted to put a woman through a wall or hurt a kid like some monster then I'm physically equipped to do so and thus there's a justifiable suspicion. At times it is a bit frustrating. 

Recently reading about male teachers not being allowed to hug or get close to students for fear of them being predators I think back to some of the awesome dudes who were a real major influence growing up and it just sucks to think that they might have been seen as sus when they got the class ice cream to explain the golden ratio or when my science teacher let me stay over and showed me that trick of setting his hand on fire because he could tell I was having an off day and wanted to show me something cool to cheer me up. You get the picture.  In fact I dealt with it close to a year ago when I took my baby cousin to the park and as I sat on the bench playing with my phone whilst keeping an eye on her I had women looking over my shoulder and giving me the side eye. There were plenty of other women doing the same but I was the one viewed with caution. 

And to be clear, this is not some ""woe is men. Lets give em all the benefit of the doubt"" type post. I KNOW why it is how it is. And far be it from me to place the feelings of a grown ass man over the safety of a woman or child. If I have to go out of my way to make sure I dont accidentally make someone feel unsafe so be it. I'm still more fortunate in that regard than someone who has to carry the fear of being a victim as opposed to being a potential victimizer.  But even acknowledging that...still sucks. No one wants to be associated with monsters. And frick the guys who make these kinds of things necessary in the first place....fucking garbage

Thinking on all this got me wondering if women generally speaking have any situations like this? Situations where they are physically or otherwise perceived as a potential threat in a situation where perhaps a man would be given more leniency and thus have to pre-emptively prove their harmlessness. And I dont mean situations like towards men who are unreasonably fearful of false accusations(although I wonder if the context of men having to prove they are not a threat feeds into that fear but that is not the conversation I'm here to have). Because I know most people, myself included, would generally feel less on edge about a strange woman approaching them or their child than a strange man(Though even in that situation I'd keep my leg muscles warm in case I need to bolt after a female kidnapper as well) . Guess I'm asking if women ever find themselves uniquely seen as the threat because of the actions of other women?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Do women have situations where they are generally more likely to be viewed as a victimizer than a man?",1

Religious beliefs vs feminist rights,"**Trigger Warning: Contains rape/incest

I was recently in a discussion with my very Christian mother. Her and I were arguing about how I feel women get disregarded as trash in American politics (as well as other countries) due to the religious protection many countries hold. Specifically we were discussing a case in the U.S where a young 12 year old girl was repeatedly raped by her older brothers in an Amish community until she became pregnant by one their offspring. 

The two oldest brother who rapped her(out of three only two were considered adults) were not charged with jail time as the prosecutor felt they would be ""torn apart"" in jail. They simply had to pay a fine and go to a class for sexual abusers. Meanwhile, the young girl received no counseling and no protection and the two brothers even broke the restraining order keeping them away from her. She gave birth to the child. 

We fought because in America specifically, religion tends to outweigh the rights if a women. 

Don't get me wrong, I am respectful of everyone's views and beliefs despite it differing than my own. However, I don't feel that that should outweigh that of a living being. There is no proof of a god/ dieti. There is proof of women. Women who are forgotten, abused, and neglected structurally in many countries/political systems. That is what I have a problem with. 

My mother feels that religion should outweigh these issues. How/what issues and evidence can I use to show that women should come first, wayyy before religion ...

Advice: Am I over analyzing?,"Hi fellow feminists. I stumbled upon this sub in the process of seeking out advice. I recently received an email from a male colleague in regard to a recent newspaper article published about a project of mine. The article was published in a small town paper where the writing here leaves a little to be desired. When made aware of the article, his response was:

‚ÄúIf you have the opportunity to review in the future prior to publishing I am happy to provide input as well. Might be worth an ask next time.‚Äù

I have a few thoughts. One is that, to my knowledge, that is not how journalism works. And secondly, his response comes off as condescending, implying his input would have made a vastly better end product. I called him out on it, simply stating I appreciated his offer but that he needed to trust that we were sufficiently capable of communicating our project.

Feminism and progressive values/conservative feminism,"Another question about the sub's rules and how they pertain to feminism. As the sub is obviously both a space for discussing and by definition a part of feminism, this seems to be a legitimate line of enquiry consistent with the sub's own rules, from what I can understand.

As the requirement is one of strict consistency, why is there no list or link to a list of the aforementioned progressive values? How is strict consistency to progressive values measured and approved, here?

Does this mean that any form of conservative feminism is not considered feminism, here? I asked a question about TERFs here a while back and it didn't seem to be a problem, the post went through and there were responses reflecting a range of opinions on the topic.

How do you handle disagreements with other feminists?,"Basically just the title but breaking it into a few sub-questions:

- Is it common that you disagree with something a fellow feminist (or person claiming to be a feminist) says regarding feminism, or with their approach to discussing a feminist issue?
- If/when you do disagree, how do you react? Do you challenge their view directly? Not say anything? Etc?
- Do you notice any difference in your answers to above questions in this community vs in the real world?

Genuinely confused by this.,"*(here comes the obligatory disclaimer): I understand that this is a divisive issue in todays society and that this can cause some people to become agitated and for that i apologise in advance. i also apologise in advance for any and all potential opinions that may cause offense in the comments section due to my asking this question.*

I'm not asking this to upset anyone, I just don't understand. which is it? is gender socially constructed? or is it biologically determined? if its socially constructed then surely it can't be possible to be born in the wrong body as you would have had no interactions with society in order to create any ideas within you. if, on the other hand, its biologically determined then everything that's built on the foundation of social constructionism is built on a fallacy and therefore brings every single concept set on that framework into question. it can't be both. surely its got to be one or the other and I dont buy the whole ""theres a difference between sex and gender"" idea. that kind of cognitive dissonance is not helpful to anyone.

What is your opinion on nature vs nurture in masculine and feminine behaviour?,"I have been met with conflicting ideas on this topic mainly a group claiming that the social environment impacts gender behaviour and it is all learned and another claiming  input from society and biological factors. Example boys and girls raised in gender neutral homes displaying different behaviour. Do you think it is wrong to believe that hormones/genes could affect gender behaviour largely and cause some gender stereotypes? Or has it all been constructed throughout recent humanity?

a quote from wikipedia says this 

As both ""nature"" and ""nurture"" factors were found to contribute substantially, often in an inextricable manner, such views (nature only/nurture only) were seen as naive or outdated by most scholars of human development by the 2000s

Example testosterone and the male aggression stereotype.

Male Fragility,"I have been so close to calling myself a feminist for years, but there are a few things that I can't quite get past. This is one of them.

Why do feminists ridicule men for being ""fragile""? 
We need men and boys to realise that its ok to not be ok. That pretending to be strong is harmful, and that it is ok to be fragile and to cry if you feel like it.

By ridiculing men and boys for being fragile, you encourage them to hide their emotions. By encouraging them to hide their emotions you are up holding the societal structures that conspire to make suicide the leading cause of death for men under 49.",1

I mean, I do get what she meant, but I just thought that they both meant the same thing?? I thought the phrase ""Desexualize the female body"" was to stop society from sexualizing us unless we ourselves wanted to?? So I'm just quite confused, maybe I'm using the phrase wrong?",1

I don't know a lot, but I reckon I know at least marginally more than average men.

At first, I was hostile about the movement, as ""feminists"" represented on media appeared to be aggressive and all they talked about was how men are bad and evil.
In videos, feminists were yelling ""kill all men"" and how they should revenge to men for suppressing them for centuries.
Above all, I even heard crazy story of a feminist who refused to give birth to her baby for that it was male.

I did not want to feel like I am a villan. 
I was certain I did nothing wrong to any women, and I liked to think I am a nice person. So I decided I do not agree with the movement and would not associate myself with anyone who has anything to do with that nonsense.

But the deal is that, 14 years old me was full of curiosity and he could not help but to find out more about it to ""hate it more"". 
However, after some sequence of events, I turned out to be liking the movement.
I read books, watched ted talks out of curiosity, and it lead me to be convinced by the narrative, so here I am.

Now I am even making small donations monthly to feminism org, but I still feel very uncomfortable talking on this matter with anyone because:

1. With women, I feel uncomfortable because it feels like I am mensplaning to them.

2. With men, I feel uncomfortable because I know people would not agree with me, and I will be judged by it.

Latter case have been much severe problem.
All of my friends who I care endearingly are very against feminism, and they hate it when I try to talk into it, as they never understand why I am agreeing with such bollocks.

I even once got into argument for the first time in 7 years with my best friend, talking about feminism and he could not fathom how I was defending such a ""horrifying antisocial movement consist of women with daddy issue that's ultimate goal is utter elimination of male species on face of the earth"".

He is a gentle man with fiance and I do not believe he have such perception because he is evil.

Nude/erotic photography and feminism,"I would love to hear the opinions of other feminists on my struggle.
I am a photographer and I do shoot various topics. My most passionate topic is nude photography. Either in erotic context or just as showing the human form/‚Äûnudity as a tool for message‚Äú. 
I am a heterosexual, 24 year young man and my preferred subjects are women. I am talking about taking pictures myself aswell as consuming art of others (photography, paintings, videography).
I have mostly shot my former and current girlfriend, from normal portraits, Fashion, artistic nude to sexually themed and some female friends. They always loved to be part of my art and are passionate feminists themselves. I see myself as a passionate feminist aswell and I sometimes struggle with the thought of ‚Äûam I part of a problem‚Äú.
I read feminist literature, research problems, read a lot about feminist media studies (since I study media) and so I am aware of a lot of representation, sexualization and male gaze problems. 
I think I sometimes have somewhat of a ‚Äûmale gaze‚Äú, because I am identifying as a male and been sadly influenced by male gaze media all my life. I am always consuming and researching a lot of female and feminist art to have that as a positive influence next to all the mainstream problematic media and to prevent applying these male gaze patterns to my art.
So my problem is always questioning my art and art consumption. I would never want to be part of the problem of ‚Äûwrong‚Äú depiction of women, sexualization and so on. How can I appreciate and adore the female form of my girlfriends and other women, without supporting in a way the oversaturated market for nude, objectified women?
Even though I would never sexualize women for the sake of sex sells, or intendedly convey any sexist message. I look up to all the women I have in my life and all the women I want to capture in my art. 
Am I naive? Do I want to combine my feminist values with something that is just not compatible? 
When women tell me they feel empowered seeing my pictures of themselves, I am always happy but at the same time think ‚Äûbut what if it is just because they know me and how I think and these pictures still are problematic in the current debates and changes that have to happen in society?‚Äú.
Enough rambling. If I have phrased anything in a problematic way I am happy to be corrected.
I hope you have some insights and opinions for me from which I can learn and grow. 
Thank you!

A little extra edit:
I am only saying ‚Äûwomen‚Äú here without defining or including non binary and so on. This ist just because I am mostly surrounded with females identifying as cis women, while having many gay, bi and queer friends. I am definitely open and very interested to photograph non binary people, transgender people and males aswell. It is just from being grown up in a society with binary views and feeling heterosexual, that I talk about my preferred subjects as ‚Äûwomen‚Äú. But I am growing, I am learning and views, habits and preferences can change. :) Hope I don‚Äôt offend anyone, if so I am open for conversation and criticism.",1
Why are feminist from anglo countries are not nationalist or not as inclined to patriotism as from other non white or mixed countries?,"To explain it better: I'm Puerto Rican and the nationalist movement here differs very much from those in USA and Europe. Even though the movement is practically dead, it was a decent large group back in the 1930's-1950. My grandma was one of them, she was also a feminist as well and went to prison a few years for it. The most prominent feminist from PR came from the nationalist movement, including lolita lebron who literally shot up the american congress. While feminist I guess from spain or germany were running away from nationalist, the nationalist movement here was where most feminist resided and it was actually the socialist who had an alliance with the republicans(not US ones) to go after feminist.

But I always found it strange that here in PR feminists do tend to have more of a nationalist mindset than those in the US or europe where nationalism is pretty much shunned and almost illegal.",1

Here it is usualy seen as their issue for not being good students or being personal choice.

The same is for the rough sleeper who are overrepresented by men but the policies focus on the women. (even the policies for gender equality)

What is the best way to explain the difference between a double standard and a personal bias to people that uses them interchangeably and incorrectly without coming off as a bisexual man hater?,"A friend of mine who is bisexual was rejected by a woman we know, who is also bi. She explained to him that the reason she doesn't date bisexual men is because she's not use to male homosexuality. She's only been exposed to women and straight men. So the idea of dating a guy who happens to go both ways is not something she's used to and I understand. 

But my friend believes it's a double standard because she's bisexual and he feels she is discriminating against him because she's not use to the idea of a man being into other men. 

But that's not what a double standard is and this girl is not homophobic or biphobic. She has a preference that does not include bisexual men and I understand that. Can anyone please give me some positive analogies I can use to get my point across without hurting my friend's feelings?",1

Last Name Change,"My girlfriend and I (male) were having a discussion about last names and what we could do if we were to get married. I have never considered changing my name or expected my future wife to do so. To me, that also includes not wanting to take on a hyphenated name either.

I‚Äôm perfectly fine with each of us keeping our last names and choosing a hyphenated name for the children but she wants us all to have the same last name and strongly thinks the solution is for both of us to change our last names to a hyphenated name. My aversion to the hyphenated name is firstly that I don‚Äôt want a longer name. Additionally, her last name translates to something that I don‚Äôt really want to have in my legal name. I like what my name translates to and I like affirming it each time I say my name.

In a perfect world, I‚Äôd like for us to have the same last name but I would never insist on her changing her name, either to mine or to a hyphenated one. Am I wrong in saying: let‚Äôs just keep our own last names and hyphenate them for the children? It seemed to spiral into a big fight when I wasn‚Äôt more submissive to hyphenating my name.

Can someone help me see this differently? Thank you.",1

Do you negatively judge people who punch or beat up a rapist/domestic abuser?,"I've seen quite a few WorldstarHipHop videos where someone in the neighborhood is discovered to have been raping/domestically abusing someone, and a bunch of people from the block beat the shit out of that person. I'm not gonna lie, I myself have gotten some catharsis out of watching those videos, especially as someone who's sister sexually assaulted by a partner.",1
Is the #WhyIdidntReport movement on twitter and other social media irrelevant?,"I recently was going through the hashtag on tumblr when I found a blog saying how stupid it was. And the username of the person clearly said she was an anti feminist. But then again, Rape is not about feminism, is it? Shouldn't it be about rape itself? So I was curious as to why she, even if she was an anti feminist, would be against such a movement. As these movements give people voices. To hear their voice. To tell them they are not alone. That you got to survive. Its not political. Its  not about feminism. Or anti feminism. Its about sexually exploiting and assaulting someone. And if they want to talk about it however and wherever they want, they can. It confused me how a person can think its stupid. I was going to share my story there but that blog and the comments in that blog made me stop. Even though I know that she is wrong...I can't do it anymore. Still, I would like to know if it is irrelevant or not.

Would socio-economic pressure on those refusing to take vaccines be a violation of bodily autonomy?,"Hey everyone, 

so I am aware that this question has been asked before but I wanted to to ask it again given that, since the pandemic , many views may have changed, especially if, like me, you are living in a country where up to 30% of people are expected to refuse it. I was also curious about people‚Äôs views on alternative means of pressuring people to take it, such as not allowing unvaccinated children in schools and allowing companies to refuse employment to those that are unvaccinated. I guess this question is mostly for those that think mandatory vaccinations are a violation because while such measures exert pressure, they only do so in order to protect the bodily autonomy of those that don‚Äôt wish to be exposed to those that present a significant health threat. Anyway, I look forward to hearing what you all thing :)",1
When do women have actual agency in the patriarchy?,I have to ask this because In a previous post it was said that everything is because of patriarchy whenever a woman chooses to do something in line with her gendered expectation then when does she actually make a decision based on her own personal agency. American sample of this would be every single time someone talks about women choosing to be a home caretaker as opposed to remaining in the workforce of patriarchy that she does this whether it be a conscious decision or not. My problem is this ignores the practicality and her being able to do it as well as her possibly wanting to do it simply because raising children might be something she wants to do and her spouse being able to financially support that decision is another reason why she makes that decision. Every example of this would be two of my friends or doctors and they are married and one of them decided to stop working because they would be spending almost the same amount of money on childcare. my male friend gave his wife the decision of whether she would stay with the family or he would and she chose that she would stay and take care of her two daughters more overtime to make up the difference. him sacrificing the time that he would have raised his daughter is another conversation but according to most feminist associated feminists on this group she made that decision because of patriarchy and it had almost little or nothing to do with her consciously deciding that she would rather spend more time raising her daughter than having her husband do it. My question is simple or fitness patriarchal structured society when exactly she making her own decision.,1
What are your thoughts on matriachal societies in works of fiction? (usually a fantasy or sci-fi book). Are there responsible or irresponsible ways of writing them?,"I'm not against writing matriarchies in fiction, but I think said work of fiction should clearly state that matriarchy or gender inequality is bad and that we shouldn't strive towards that, or else many people might interpret these works of fiction as being an endorsement of matriarchy. 

I remember one book I read in 7th grade the (can't remember the name but I'm pretty sure it was written in the 1970s) that was a futuristic sci-fi fantasy type book about a matriarchal society where young boys and girls are raised collectively by adult women and surnames don't exist, only unique one-word names (example: Socrates) The society in the book is peaceful and relatively equal on an interpersonal level, but is lead and controlled solely or mostly by women. (If you know the name of the book, tell me) The book came off as being very pro-matriarchy to me. The book seemed to endorse, at least implicitly, the idea that the world be more peaceful and better in every way if society was lead solely or mostly by women. But we already have real world examples of women in politics who are warhawks, such as Neera Tanden, Hillary Clinton, Nikki Haley, Gina Haspel, (pretty much the whole GOP) and the former female president of Myanmar who waged a genocide to the country's Rohinga Muslims. Some female politicians are corrupt and have disregard for the poor and disenfranchised, such as Diane Feinstein and Nancy Pelosi, and pretty much every elected Republican woman. I get really annoyed when some people (I'm not accusing most feminists of believing this, it's more the New Agey goddess movement types) sincerely believe all the worlds problems would women just controlled all the major centers of power and authority. It seems so naive and childish to think that. I think a fictional matriarchy should be written in such a way that it serves as a criticism of gender inequality as a way to structure society. For example, you can write a book about a fictional black supremacist society, but said fictional society should serve as a criticism of racial supremacy as a concept by trying to flip our current real-world white supremacist society on it's head. The same can be done with gender.",1
Wouldn't absolute equality take away from female privilege and made privilege,"That's suppose to say male privilege .If a quality is supposed to mean the same and equal treatment financially legally and socially. Then that means either we treat women like men or we treat men like women and give them the same exact responsibilities, obligations, pay regardless of qualifications or child rearing prospects. We view them the same way and treat them the same way. This would naturally mean treating women like men with both the consequences of being a man and the rewards of being a man. Naturally I'm going to exclude criminals and criminal behavior unless we're talking about sentencing or disciplining them since their is a gender bias in sentencing.",1
Where should the line be drawn for sex work in monogamous relationships?,"First of all I want to say that I am aromantic, therefore I don‚Äôt understand the emotional parts of a relationship so I try to approach logically and rationalize people‚Äôs feelings.

So I am pretty sure most people here support sex work, and think that the standard should be that a partner doesn‚Äôt mind that their partner is a sex worker. I also think this way. My question is that if that is okay is having sexual intercourse while in a relationship also okay? Now I tried to come up with reasons why one is right while the other isn‚Äôt but not much has worked for me.

For instance, one reason could be that intercourse is personal and attraction or even a relationship could be born from that while sex work is usually a one time thing. But then again attraction can be born from a lot of things including simply having male friends and it would be ridiculous to be limiting to that extent

How do (or should) monogamous feminists feel about their partners doing sex work and their partners having sexual intercourse?",1
Toxic Masculinity v/s personal preferences.,"How can we differentiate between Toxic Masculinity v/s personal preferences? Say, I would not like it if I found out that my gf had an onlyfans or had a large number of sexual partners in the past.

Again, I know it is none of my business what she does with her body and with whom, but I think I can make the choice to not continue a relationship with her - like having an onlyfans  / having sex with a lot of people was her choice, and me breaking up with her is my choice? And anyway, if I am such a ""terrible"" person just because I broke up with her because of that, she should not want to be with me right? So everyone wins - since now she could probably find a guy who would not judge her for that? ",1
Is Clementine Ford considered fringe in the feminist movement?,"My partner started reading her books and so out of curiosity I googled her.

Do you believe referring to grown adult women as 'girls' enables pedophilia as well as sexism?,"I am thinking of writing a blog post, or perhaps a making a YouTube essay critiquing the use of the word 'girls' by young adult men (my demographic).

Do teenage boys have to learn with age to respect women? Are many of them sexist?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/k73cnr/has_anyone_else_noticed_this_sub_getting_really/

I my experience from high school and also from reading online...teenage boys are the most sexist demographic. I.e being openly sexist and hating girls. I remember fishy jokes and sexist jokes. And also many gamers for example are young men and teens and apparently they are incredibly sexist and make rape threats towards girl gamers. It also seems it's mostly young men and teen boys who incels or are indoctrinated to hate women the most.

Also when someone makes a sexist joke or a ""fishy"" vagina or ""axe wound"" joke for example...many say they are probably just ""pathetic immature teenage boys"" as if that is expected of them so any adult who behaves that way is acting immature like them. Whenever people say that i wonder why immaturity makes men sexist?

On the other hand most teen girls are really into boys. They adore boys in boybands, write in diaries about boys, want boyfriends, and some even have internalised misogyny and be anti feminist themselves by saying ""I'm not like other girls!"" Want to be friends with boys. Etc.

Do you think most or many teenage boys are sexist and with age learn to respect or tolerate women? It seems like the starting point and default for many men is being sexist maybe due to hormones and then with age it gradually gets less extreme. 

I think from what I've seen and learned...the biggest differences in how women and men view each other are shown in how teenage girls are with the opposite sex and how teenage boys are with the opposite sex. Sadly.",1

However, she tells you that she used to be a stripper for a brief period of time in her life to make it through school or whatever. Would that change how you saw her?

To me, if everything in the relationship was going well and what they did in the past isn‚Äôt relevant to the present anymore I honestly don‚Äôt see what the problem is if you guys really love each other.

Why are gamers racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic + not really cool to people who are nuerodivergent but I dont know the name for that yet ect?,"Now I know this is going to come across real low effort and probably trip up the antagonism alarm but I do want to ask the question.

I go to r/gamingcirclejerk a fair bit and the ones where ha ha ""Gamers do weird things for fake internet points"" dont really interest me or the ones where we make fun of some niche concept liek showing off a thing.  

But the ones that are interesting are the ones where gamers freak out over gay people, trans people, black people ect.  The ones where you can see the elitism (see Jim Fucking Sterling Son's New Video on it, its good), that's usually kinda gendered and toxically masculine.  Dont get them started on Brie Larson.

But I have to ask why?  Why are ""Gamers"" like this?  Why these guys?  You can extend the same question to anime fans but still why?  Like I know why gaming is heavily masculine, 90s and 80s commercials (which I do have to ask, why doesnt the ""Now you're playing with power!  Now you're playing with Super Power! Appeal to women?  Is that just representation?  Like if a girl was in that commercial would it have caught on?), marketed to just boys and kept on as they grew older.  But why did that create such a toxic space?

How much is regular toxic masculinity but other places like sports are just as masculine leaning but they dont have the same reputation but maybe I'm wrong on that?

What are your opinions on capitalism?,"Hello,

I am not a right winger but I grew up in a conservative family and as such got a rather large dosing of conservative media. As a part of all that, you get to hear all about the evils of socialism and sjws and feminism and whatever. One thing right wing media does a lot is constantly paint feminists and social rights activists with a relatively broad brush and say that they all fit into this category. That's rather ridiculous as I have talked to a lot of feminists and the diversity of opinion between them is wide ranging. Regardless, one thing you consistently hear is that they are socialist or whatever, and a lot of feminists that I have met and talked to aren't the biggest fans of capitalism to say the least. I often hear the capitalism reinforces the patriarchy or in and of itself is gendered. To be honest, I have never fully understand what people mean by this. So, I came to ask. First and foremost, what does it mean when people say that capitalism is inherently gendered and patriarchal. What mechanisms does it use. The gender pay gap? Is that an inherently capitalist idea? Or are there other ways I'm not familiar with. Second, do you agree with these ideas. Is capitalism something you see as something we need to fight against or is it something that can be modified to be workable? Why/why not? Preemptive thanks for the replies!",1
What do feminists think of the South African farm murders?,"I know that this doesn't directly correlate to feminist ideals and beliefs and is moreso a race issue rather than a feminist issue (if there's a subreddit more appropriate, please let me know and I'll delete this post), but I would like to see what feminists think of it nonetheless. TW// mentions of rape and torture

Little bit of history, I was born in South Africa and raised there until I was 7, currently residing in the UK though, that being said, majority of my family still lives in South Africa. I'm not even sure whether people are aware of it, but there has been a scary amount of South Africa farm murders, particularly targeting white farmers, they weren't just murders however, majority were brutally tortured and some raped, this kind of farm murder has been the majority of cases ever since the land reform act by the South African government, majority of South Africans believe this to be because the government themselves have not only called for it (https://youtu.be/-VXJrxM2HPc Malema, a member of South African parliament) but also due to the fact that majority of the farms had nothing actually stolen as well as inhuman acts of cruelty.

That being said, I have seen people deny that it's actually happening, despite the fact that the exact same thing happened in Zimbabwe (with Mugabe saying to white farmers to fight his government and risking a jail sentence or flee from Zimbabwe), farm murders rose continually from 2011 to 2018 where the numbers dropped and have started rising again.

What I want to know is whether you believe that they are being killed because they're white or if you don't think so, why not?

This is not meant to be antagonising but genuinely curious as to the thinking that it's not due racism that these attacks are being carried out.",1
Why is being eco-friendly more popular with women?,"&gt;Scholars have proposed several explanations for this gender gap, including differences in gender socialization and resulting value systems (e.g., altruism, compassion), perceptions of general risk and vulnerability, and feminist beliefs including commitment to egalitarian values of fairness and social justice. [Some researchers](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08941920.2011.651191) also note that some of the strongest gender differences are found in concern about specific environmental problems, particularly local problems that pose health risks.

These are the potential reasons cited by the authors of the study, but do you think there is more to it than just these? I remember reading somewhere that a study showed that men and women both viewed eco-friendly products as being more feminine and that most eco-friendly products are indeed marketed towards women. Do you think there is a resulting stigma around men who try to be environmentally conscious? And on that note, do you think women are held to a higher standard when it comes to being eco-friendly?

How do you acknowledge and or reconcile differences in men and women‚Äôs sex drives?,"Context: yes men and women both get horny but to the extent of which and how much of a physical impact said hornieness affects gender is the focus of the question. In the context of relationships, hookup culture, ect. In life as a man it seems the physical impact of said sexuality is greater for men than it is women. Do you think horniness has a bigger impact on men than women simply because men dont require the emotional connection that women often do and as science notes men are more visually triggered in avg than women. 


Note this is only focused on internal emotions and not trying to justify anyones inability to control themselves. This is simply focusing on the difference of healthy sexual urges that men have vs women.

Edit: i noticed this got flagged as a reoccurring question. I checked previous threads on sex drives prior to this and noticed a lot of talk about it being a ‚Äúmyth‚Äù of the differences in male and female sex drive . I think science says otherwise that testosterone breeds in men 365 days a year the equivalent of what women feel at the peak of their cycle only once a month. So i think its fair to say its not a myth that men experience greater sex drives

https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5614694/amp

Edit: The argument is not that women don‚Äôt have sexual appetites. Its that men are willing to and are driven to go further than women to achieve sex. A man is much more willing to jump through hoops to get to consensual first, second or third base opportunities where on the flip. Do women have to jump through hoops for sex? Note yes women perform risk assessment for any relationship encounter but jumping through hoops isnt the same as a risk assessment.

\- Victims not wanting to destroy the life of the rapist (Yes unfortunately this happens, somtimes by being pressured from someone)

\- Not enough evidence for conviction.

&amp;#x200B;

The solution for #1 is, to conduct victim interviews by trained specialists, unfortunately to often this is not the case.

I have no clue how to solve #2 and #3 ( I guess #3 being the most frequent and therefore most important).

Of course, preventing rape is the most important thing, but I want to focus on the conviction problem.",1

Good animes without major sexualization of women or anything generally offensive to feminists?,"I'd like to watch anime more, but I can never get into it. About half of the time, I get fed up with all the annoying sexism and fanservice by the 2nd or 3rd episode and I give up on it. It's not like the woman with a big bust size it's the problem, it's more of how sexualized she'd become and usually involves extremely bad boob physics that only an incel could think of. Sadly, 70% of all the anime I can find seems to have that, 1% are alright, and the other 29% are either genres I dislike (such as magical girls and majority of shonen) or really badly done (like most shojos).

&amp;#x200B;

My absolute favorite animes would have to be FMA Brotherhood, Psychopass, Erased and YLIA, since they're mostly based on story and don't have any unnecessary problems (that I can remember, at least. Also excluding Lust from FMA, as she's there more for story purposes and is sexualized because of obvious reasons.). What would you guys suggest? Thanks!",1

What do you think about the coverage of Sarah Fuller the replacement kicker on the Vanderbilt football team?,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Fuller_(athlete)#College_football_career
The story of Sarah Fuller a women's soccer player dominated sports news last week 
but has received some backlash because a lot of people feel it was blown out of proportion to the point of patronizing her because she is a woman. There were other female place kickers before her who played in college but they are hailing her as the first woman to play in a power 5 game and comparing her to Jackie Robinson. She was chosen as a last resort because there were no other place kickers available due to covid, and there was no men's soccer team. 

When she did perform on the field she performed up to expectations but expectations for her were not set very high compared to most other kickers in the college game. In short she didn't blow it but didn't do anything extraordinary for a kicker (man or woman) 

At halftime she gave the team a speech calling the other players out even though she had only been a football player for less than a week before she joined the team (which actually got a lot of criticism as well) I think a lot of the criticism had to do with her being a woman but I'm not sure if it was appropriate to make such a big deal out of a pedestrian performance because of her gender. But maybe women can see this and be inspired by knowing they have a chance?",1

Thoughts on this article regarding a matriarchy?,"[How Life Under The Matriarchy Would Be.](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/matriarchy-sjbn/) (lot of mentions of sex in this article so I put NSFW just to be safe)

Personally, I felt as though the article was a bit too sex-centered and even though the author denied it, the proposal does seem to treat men as second class citizens playing by different rules because they can't be trusted. To be blunt, it strikes me as a terrible and unfair proposal that the author(not to disregard the rules, it just seems a justified use here) would NEVER accept were we to replace the roles in said proposal. and thus it comes off to me as though there is an assumption in this proposal that women as a whole simply know better and should always be deferred to. But I'd very much like to hear your thoughts on it.  Do you agree with my assessment? Disagree?  Or have aspects of this proposed utopia that you like and dislike?",1

Is stranger danger overblown in America to the point its hurting us,"Ive posted a few times on this thread and often times whenever dating comes up women mention the fear of being assaulted. While in no way am I downplaying victims of sexual assault or that it is a real problem, but is it taken out of context? While a disproportionate number of victims of sexual assault are women these crimes are committed by a disproportionately small number of men. Im not here to ‚ÄúNot All Men‚Äù manspalian. But if you were to do a quick search on the number of men who have assaulted women its an abysmally low number like less than half of half of half a percent of men are responsible for committing the most crimes against women. In addition the vast majority of these crimes were from family members or close friends or family targeting children. That said it seems our fears are misplaced in stranger danger ideology and dating when the reality is that the majority if people, strangers, men included, statistically don‚Äôt pose any threat and yet Americans in the safest country in the world sometimes move as though strangers are going to randomly assault, murder, rob, or rape them when we are living in the safest times in one of the safest countries ever.",1
Any UK (transgender) medical ethics people here?,"As you might know, there has been this recent ruling (PDF warning) [*Bell v Tavistock*](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bell-v-Tavistock-Judgment.pdf) the high court concluded that under 16s are unable to give consent to recieve puberty blockers. 

This is a very strange ruling considering the context and history of similar cases relating to consent of minors and in particular with regards to sexual health. They've basically concluded that under 16s are not intellectually capable of understanding the details and consequences of medical transition. That's an *absurd* and *obscene* conclusion to make - and it doesn't seem to line up with any of the relevant law on the matter, and also doesn't seem to have much to do with the cases presented.

I've just also noted that one of the third party interventions is from a company called (CW transphobia) &gt;!Transgender Trend Ltd.!&lt; That is, a company whose very name probably qualifies as a hate crime. 

This honestly seems like a purely political ruling, which is extrapolating *wildly* from the concerns originally presented. I cannot understand how this happened.

But regardless, we need to fight it. So I'm asking for any specialists in (transgender) medical ethics who can hopefully provide a course of action (both legal and otherwise) by which we can fight this.

We're kind of under time pressure here, consideing that this ruling will affect some who are *currently* using puberty blockers, and if they're forced to go off them, the consequences could be dire.",1
Thoughts on the lock and key analogy for men and women‚Äôs double standard with dating number of partners?,"First off slut shamming is terrible and this is not to condone it, troll it, justify it ect. Thats not the point of this post its to posit a serious question if how men and women have different standards for sexual partners. That said.

But the analogy goes men are like keys women are like locks. A lock that can be opened by many keys is seen as not as valuable, a key that can open any lock is seen as valuable, and a lock that many keys want to open but cant is seen as valuable and a lock that no-one wants to open is seen as not valuable.

While simplistic, i think its meant to point out that in western dating sex is relatively easier for women than it is for men broadly speaking( the whole average guy and average women walk into a bar who has a better chance of getting lucky that night) to obtain sex on avg. Men who have several previous sexual partners are seen as valuable by other guys because he has achieved something that is difficult and takes effort for most guys. Women value these guys because of said efforts ( be in gym time, learning to be charismatic, and learning skills that women generally find attractive, and other things because women‚Äôs sexual attraction is so much more complex than mens)

If a woman wanted to increase the  number of people she slept with she might have to lower some standards but she wouldn‚Äôt have to learn any skills to get a guy to sleep with her it and its safe to assume she could do that by simply matching on tinder and finding someone same night. A man looking to do the same would have to actually put in serious effort for the same result. So for that reason society might value chastity or even just lower previous sexual partner counts in a women differently because in a way its an exercise of self control and good selection/ having higher standards? Just a thought.

Edit: also I‚Äôm not saying or implying sex with women as any type of prize or saying men should be guaranteed sex. Just pointing out a difference in the effort it takes to achieve the same mutual goal

Edit: also not implying women are property. Sex is a relation but i am merely pointing out are there are different amounts of effort to put in to achieve the same mutual beneficial sexual relation

Edit: many if you have made a great point. The value part of the analogy is distracting and implies sexism. To better highlight the effort difference i think its better to use the job analogy of men have to apply for even a few women to  prove they are not a threat and may be worth sleeping with where as women have to filter through applicants. While both have their challenges one can lower their standards to filter out a suitable partner for a mutual relationship while the other has to inevitably  work  harder in their resume and or apply more. Different roles different skill sets to achieve mutually beneficial sex",1

Who is telling the truth in this situation?,"Ok

I am a man who is somewhat politically active (I focus on issues regarding child custody, special needs and a few other things, and before you ask, I don't follow a party and don't plan to follow a party)

In a debate on the issue of child custody, a woman who was debating me stated that anyone who supported the idea of rebuttable shared custody was not a true feminist and a true feminist would understand that children are always better off with the mother, except for cases of abuse (which she stated that those should be proven in criminal court, if applicable).

A while later, I had a similar discussion with a different woman (also a feminist, same topic) who stated that the feminist position is or should be to support shared custody when there's no abuse. The topic then turned to gender roles and how they should or shouldn't apply.

What I want to know is who of these people is right and why? If the feminist position is to oppose shared custody or to support it, fine. But it cannot be both at the same time.

For clarity, I understand that they have a personal opinion on the topic, I'm more worried about the position of feminism as a whole on the topic.

Recommended Radical Readings,"Hello. My sister has been going into  process of radicalization in regard to feminism and I want to help her by guiding her. I am excited she has begun this exploration of politics and values, and am eager to see where she gets; however, I have notied most of the content she gets comes from social media and a couple of gender studies bachelors, which is good, but I think that would go well with some theory from some cool academics. I kinda wanna surprise her for christmas with some books like ""hey, this is important, I love you're getting into it, have some resources as a symbol of my support""

We're Mexicans and she, like many other women, have been drawn to feminism because of the recent movements. She's 15, so the works cannot be too specific on a single thing (like law or philosophy), but she's really smart so complex is fine, just not too technical. I already found ""Are Women Human?"" by Catharine MacKinnon and I think that's something that will interest her deeply and that she can understand; going along those lines would be great. She is obviously more interested in radical feminism becaus that's the most popular branch in Mexico, and if you happen to know about any LatAm writers, that would be great. If you have any questions I'm happy to anwer them, and thank you for your help :)

Can I be a traditionally masculine guy without contributing to societal misogyny?,"I would post this on r/MensLib but they don't do personal stuff.

So here's the rub. I am a 19M and come from a relatively conservative family (though I am a liberal). I worry that I am not man enough a lot. I am a vegan for ethical reasons, I have listened to music from people like Swift, I have secretly enjoyed rom coms, I am trying to get new clothes because I am insecure about appearance, etc. Traditionally this stuff is considered more feminine than masculine. I want to be more traditionally masculine in the sense that I want to think of myself as a man and want to feel that I deserve to be called a man. I have 0 problem if other men want to do this stuff, you're a man if you feel you are after all, but I feel like I have to earn it in order to say it and to honestly feel it. However, I also recognize the tremendous damage traditional gender roles has done to people and how it has contribute to widespread societal misogyny. Like the idea that men are always out for sex and should dominate leads to sexual harassment and at its worse sexual violence  which is obviously horrendous.

I want to be more traditionally masculine in the positive sense, i.e. more physically strong, confident, protective, capable of providing, a leader, etc not in the sense of like treating women like objects or being a womanizer. More Steve Rogers than james bond if that makes sense.

However, I wonder if I can still be masculine in the traditional sense without contributing to misogyny. I don't want to be misogynistic and I worry that worrying I am too feminine is inherently bigoted and sexist. There's nothing wrong with being feminine I just don't want to be. Is such thinking sexist? Am I being misogynistic? Can I be more ""masculine"" without contributing to sexism? I'm trying to figure out what it means to be a man and who I should be.

Is having more women and fewer men better for both men and women?,"Of course, selecting sex in a way that results in a ratio other than parity is perhaps not ethical or even feasible, but let's abstract away from this issue in order to facilitate the thought experiment: would having more women and fewer men lead to

a) Less crime, particularly violent crime: Men are largely responsible for most violent crime.

b) A less patriarchal society: this is a little vague, as ""the patriarchy"" may not be invariant under such a change and may take a form that we perhaps cannot anticipate. So let's just say a society where men do not control the vast majority of resources.

c) Better women's safety: Related to point a)

d) Less frustrated, lonely men: It seems to me that cis-hetero men (i.e. large majority of men) tend to become more resentful and angry without female companionship than other groups of people do when they are lonely. There's a plethora of reasons why this may be case but I won't get into it. 

Hypothetical ""what-ifs"" are necessarily somewhat difficult to answer, but I there's a specific reason I wanted to engage in this thought experiment which is to answer these (perhaps more fundamental) questions

e) Are women inherently less violent than men (on average) or do men simply possess a monopoly on violence due to being physically stronger than women.?

f) Does a patriarchal society need a critical mass of men? Or can a women majority society still lead to a deification of the rare man?",1

That made sense to me, but later I saw some other people say that misandry does exist, for example how when parents divorce, the child automatically goes to the mother even if they want otherwise, and that how some people generalising men by saying they're all inherently evil etc. can hurt victims of abuse because it plays on their emotions and makes them feel more paranoid.

Feminism uniting with other equal rights movements?,"My understanding is that feminism is a movement that fights for EQUALITY of the sexes.  I emphasize EQUALITY because there are movements/organizations/groups that fight for permanent or temporary PRIVILEGES.

How to be wild in a world that does not accept wilderness?,"I recently finished reading Glennon Doyle‚Äôs book ‚ÄúUntamed,‚Äù which I feel should be required reading for everyone.

I love this notion, and have been working on speaking my mind more and more, to break free of the idea that women stay quiet and please everyone and not take up space. But I struggle with breaking free of many gendered expectations because I‚Äôm scared the world won‚Äôt accept me...and I‚Äôm curious if anyone else feels this way and how they‚Äôve combatted it?

I can‚Äôt quite remember if he was asking for explicit permission the entire process before doing something or letting her take the lead or a mix of both.

Anyways, a commenter mentioned how that was ‚Äúunsexy‚Äù and unattractive and that men needed to lead and not ask for permission throughout. I disagreed with the commenter‚Äôs idea as I believe in explicit, radical consent. However, it left me wondering if there was a right way and a wrong way to carry out radical consent in practice.",1

My question, is that when you see something done by a company, whether it is an ad campaign or PR tweet or anything like that, that aims to promote feminism in some way, does it give off a feeling that it might be just virtue signalling for brownie points? I don't mean to discredit companies that do help feminism, but there are some companies that 'promotes' feminism but then you have employees coming out saying that 'women are being treated horribly' etc. Take Riot Games for example.

Gender and language: why?,"I have zero anthropological nor linguistic background.Personally I find it uncomfortable to use gendered language. One of the reasons being that I find it odd that I have to decline verbs, nouns and adjectives differently when speaking/writing French. Gender is rarely relevant in speech. If it is then it can be explicitly mentioned as it is done for other attributes. I would find it equally jarring if we had different ways of addressing someone that depended on their ethnicity.

1. I was wondering why do a lot of indo-european languages use the concept of gender to address a person. Why have masculine and feminine forms of addressing and not some other way of classifying an interlocutor (age for example) or even none?

Why do sexual fantasies seem to deeply follow gender norms?,"I don't know whether this is the place to ask the question but here goes, I've been reading up on sexual fantasies held by men and women. It seems to me that it's not uncommon for women to desire rough sex/have rape fantasies even though they'd never want to be raped. Similarly, many men have fantasies about dominating another woman.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, why do these fantasies follow the 'gender script' of the man being dominant and woman being submissive? It seems very uncommon to find men fantasizing about being dominated along with finding women who fantasize about dominating/raping.

"""Women's logic"" as an evolutionary survival strategy","Please take this as a serious scientific inquiry.

1) Up to a certain time, survival of the children depended heavily on the father's presence in the family.  Therefore women‚Äôs ability to ‚Äúkeep the man around‚Äù after conception was an essential survival strategy.

2) In numerous books we hear authors idealizing a woman as a mystery.  Perhaps this is an indication that inability to understand the opposite sex is an attractant for males.

3) If this is true, could there be an evolutionary pressure to produce behavior that is difficult to understand and therefore helps maintain the family?  Giving birth to what is called ""Women's logic"".

4) From game theory we know that the best strategy taken by an opponent should appear random to the other player.  Can this fact apply?

Understanding white feminist as a black man,"Hello its my first time posting but i come with nothing but good intentions and a desire to see and understand others viewpoint. As a black man in America its often strange to see white women speak of oppression from men. It would seem to me that they are complaining about oppression from their own families and friends seeing as how at least on America 9/10 times the only men who have any sort of ‚Äúpower‚Äù over them are other white men. Non white men don‚Äôt hold that much power in America as a whole as we often don‚Äôt own resources/ means of production ect, And most of the black women that I have grown up with have had the majority of their oppression come from other whites male and female as opposed to black men. Not saying that black men cant and aren‚Äôt sexist, but from a socioeconomic and power dynamic perspective isnt the majority of oppression coming from white men and women. (Note im well aware of intersectionality but i think its important to view oppression through an economic lens as it paint a less biased picture. From there we see greater disparities between races than we do gender with white men and women always being at the top.) 

TLDR: how should black and minority men view feminism when the vast majority of this gendered oppression is linked directly back to white men and women(e.i. The number of white women who voted for trump) 

Thank you and nothing but love to ya

Edit:

The reason why i bring up economics is because you can easily measure it in terms of who stands where most other metrics of oppression are based on feelings and there isnt a concrete way to say where anyone stands.

Also black men and women power dynamics isnt the same as in white house holds. Yes there are exceptions but most black women in my life have always been strong well educated leaders who for the most part out perform black men from many socioeconomic indicators. It just seems like white women loom at how their moms and aunts were treated by sexist men and assume thats how everyones household is when it couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.",1

Cancelling men and toxic masculinity,"So I understand that male actors or males in the hollywood business do not really contribute something to society, so it is easy to cancel them and not watch their stuff and kick them out of their jobs  - but what if we talk about people like Newton, Einstein, Nikola Tesla, Christian Barnard, Louis Pasteur. So if you found out that they were rapists or sexual assaulters, does that mean that their contributions to science does not mean anything anymore?  For instance, Christian Barnard was a South African, so it is very likely that he was actively involved in apartheid, but without him, we would not have the heart transplant.   That we should deny their genius and then maybe feminists should also stop using any appliances/products that seem to have resulted out of their toxic masculine minds.

I mean, I saw some posts here about Sean Connery. He was born in 1930. His movies are not sexist, they are an accurate representations of the times that he lived in.

Can the Male Gaze exist in Feminism?,"Hi, new to the sub, and Feminism as a whole. I've been skimming through the sub, primarily on topics of the Male Gaze and Objectification, as they are deeply intertwined in the types of media that I generally consume. I'm kind of digging myself out of that unfortunate bubble where the dominant thought about Feminism when it comes to the Male Gaze is, ""Feminists just want everyone covered up, and no attractive women at all, in anything, ever and if you disagree you're a sexist, bigot etc. etc."" I don't think I ever got to the point where I believed that in its entirety, but I can't help but think sometimes that there's a kernel of truth to it, sometimes. 
Say we do finally reach an equal/nearly equal world as Feminism aims for, does that mean that the Male Gaze has been completely dismantled because it can lead to objectification, and eventually dehumanization of marginalized groups, mostly women, or can it exist if it were used more limitedly, and wasn't the predominant mode of media? 

TL;DR Does the Male Gaze have to be destroyed in its entirety in order for us to reach an equal society, or just significantly limited until other points of view are normalized?

"Why is there still so much stigma towards women that want to be welders, firefighters, or roofers?",,1
Why is the negative reinforcement that women receive about sex (slut-shaming) seen as a problem but not the negative reinforcement that men receive about sex?,"The general argument that I hear from feminists, about why it seems like men are far more interested in sex than women in heterosexual relationships, is that it's because society condemns the female expression of sexuality by slut-shaming those who engage in it. Now although I disagree with this premise, for the sake of this post, I'm going to assume it's a fact and that women face a lot of judgement in society for the free expression of their sexuality that serves as negative reinforcement.

What I actually wanted to talk about is the other side of the coin that I don't see often feminists address, which is that when men pursue a purely sexual/aromantic relationship, they are still condemned for not seeking it in the manner that women deem appropriate. My argument is that any kind of sexual desire outside of certain types of sexual-romantic relationships is stigmatized, and judging from the way media tends to portray men who seek a purely sexual relationship, one of those stigmas seems to be enforced much more on men rather than women.

For example, here's a list of characters that are written in a way that makes them seem repugnant for desiring sex without it being nested within a romantic relationship.

(Note: Some of these aren't portrayed as assholes, but they are still looked down on by other characters.)

* Hugo in Killing Eve
* Hank Moody in Californication
* Alan Shore in Boston Legal
* Dan Fielding in Night Court
* Ben and Fitz in Friends With Benefits (mostly not viewed negatively by other characters, although Ben is viewed as immature and shallow)
* Lucifer in Lucifer
* Hawkeye Pierce in M\*A\*S\*H
* Eliot in The Magicians
* Sebastian in Cruel Intentions
* Euan in Off Centre
* Kurt in Horrible Bosses
* Harrison in Scandal
* Dennis in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Dean in Supernatural
* James Bond
* Neal Caffrey in White Collar

I personally find the double standards really appalling where a woman's sexual hang-ups are seen as a responsibility of society whereas for men it's not even considered an issue that needs to be solved.

The general perception about men who engage in numerous casual sexual affairs with women is that he's a misogynist who objectifies them, even though that‚Äôs between him and the women he‚Äôs had sexual relations with. The argument is that because he had sex with these women, he treated them like objects, less than men.

But this analysis is predicated on two assumptions:

1. A romantic relationship is morally superior to one that's purely sexual.
2. You can't find somebody sexually attractive and still be extremely respectful of their autonomy as capable smart human being

Seeing your sexual partners as playthings for your own amusement is completely fine as long as you‚Äôre sexual partners with those people consensually. That‚Äôs between you and them. Sexual attraction without romantic attraction or even friendship is fine and valid, and some people can‚Äôt even feel romantic attraction, while still being able to feel sexual attraction.

I feel like I'm saying something very obvious when I assert that it's not abuse to have consensual sex with people that you‚Äôre only interested in sexually, not romantically or platonically. If women really weren‚Äôt okay with what they were getting into with him, then they shouldn‚Äôt have consented, and that‚Äôs on the women, not the guy.

Women often speak about how a man isn't owed sex from women, but the inverse of this, where a woman expects romance from a man who has sex with her, isn't talked about as much. For some reason, it's believed that it's easier for men to be open about seeking and having casual sexual encounters that don't carry any expectations of romance or ongoing commitment without facing judgement, even though I sincerely believe they receive just as much negative reinforcement because romance is looked at as some kind of universal ultimate good thing whereas sex without romance is evil and wrong and harmful. It's like purity culture and sex shaming, which is harmful to everyone but especially toxic toward anyone who has sex outside of romantic relationships. At the end of the day, there is nothing wrong with having sex without romance. Ever. Romance isn't inherently good, sex isn't inherently bad, and romance doesn't ""purify"" sex or whatever (nor does it need to). Sexual attraction isn't wrong or objectifying or predatory or manipulative; your actions are what matter. Sure, it's not something that everyone wants, but neither is romance.

Anyway, in conclusion, I believe if feminists want to see the negative reinforcement towards sex-seeking women as a problem that needs to be solved, then so should the negative reinforcement that happens towards men who seek the same kind of sex.",1

What are your views on Leonardo Dicaprio dating girls half his age?,"My view on this is that as long as two people are legal adults and there is consent, there is nothing wrong with dating people who are younger/older to you. I often hear feminists say that he is a creep and should be condemned. However, not once do they say anything about the girls who are willing to date him. Do you believe that those girls have no agency and not a thought process of their own to make decisions for themselves? Why do you need to villianise him? Either condemn both genders or dont do it at all. Truth be told, most men who are as rich and successful as him would date models in their 20s. Similarly, most women would not decline if Leo fucking Dicaprio asked them out. Why such double standards? Funnily enough, Jada Smith did not receive flak (atleast not at the level men get) for dating August, who was 20yrs old. People are free to do what they want, as long as it is legal. Live and let live.

Edit: Okay. I see that I ruffled a few feathers here. But if you call leo a creep and don't call the women gold diggers, you are a hypocrite. Either don't shame any of them or shame both. You can't have your cake and eat it too.

"I want to be a feminist, but I am not sure. Should I be one?","Now, DON'T get me wrong.

Another skepticality I have with feminism is the attack on the MRM (Men's Rights Movement). While I do think that MRM derived from feminism, my view on it isn't harsh. i don't think they bring down women (AND IF THEY DO THEY SHOULD BE CALLED OUT ON IT!), but rather bring awareness to the problems men face like the higher rate of suicide, or the unfair family courts.

Now, something I REALLY hate is the #KillAllMen movement or the #MenTears movement. a 2013 [HuffPost/YouGov poll](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/feminism-poll_n_3094917.html) found that only 23 percent of women and 16 percent of men consider themselves to be feminists.

Why do some people find it so hard to accept calling women ‚Äúfemale/s‚Äù is offensive?,"I was arguing with someone who just didn‚Äôt get it (see my comments and you should easily find it if you‚Äôre interested in what I said) 
I don‚Äôt understand why some people just refuse to accept it‚Äôs wrong. 
It‚Äôs wrong for many reasons but the main two are obvious: 
1.	‚Å†It‚Äôs actually ungrammatical . ‚ÄúFemale‚Äù is an adjective not a noun and describes the sex of a species, for humans, the correct term for adult female is ‚Äúwomen‚Äù.
2.	‚Å†Semantic change: When people use ‚ÄúFemale‚Äù in place of ‚Äúwomen‚Äù they typically do it with the sole purpose of degrading women. It‚Äôs used to dehumanise women. ‚ÄúFemale‚Äù could describe any animal that has eggs.

Why is it so hard for people to realise this? 

I also found an interesting article here: 

https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/time.com/4300170/female-word/%3famp=true

Which suggests the term has been offensive even as far back as 1850!

Edit: I know it can also be used as a noun however it‚Äôs more often than not an adjective, when it‚Äôs used to dehumanise women it is almost always being used in a way that is ungrammatical. 

I‚Äôm not objecting the word full stop there is nothing wrong with statements like ‚Äúthe female brain differs from the male brain‚Äù or ‚Äúon average females tend to have longer hair styles‚Äù 

What I‚Äôm objecting to is statements like ‚Äúall females are the same‚Äù and ‚Äúfemales be like [insert misogynistic comment here]‚Äù as a method of dehumanising women. In this context using ‚Äúfemales‚Äù is a stones throw away from ‚Äúfemoid‚Äù and ‚Äúfoid‚Äù which are undoubtedly sexist.

What do people think about using TVTropes to gauge the prevalence of stereotypes in media?,"Media can create, affirm, and challenge popular stereotypes, and can serve as a sort of litmus test on societal perceptions at large.  However, measuring media seems like a near-impossible task to do well - one can only watch so much, and even that won't likely be a representative sample of all media.

[This blog](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/experiments/quantifying-gender-stereotypes-in-pop-culture/) (first post in r/menslib but I think the approach is useful more generally) tries to use TVTropes as way of outsourcing the work of ""watching and categorizing all the media"".  The idea is that TVTropes covers a huge selection of media (not just TV), and seems to have a somewhat rigorous method for identifying stereotypes.  Yes, the info is sourced from imperfect humans and all our biases, but for such a difficult and vague task can we expect much better?

The author compiles all the stereotypes that are associated with gender, and looks at which are the most prevalent.  Furthermore, the date of each occurrence is tracked, allowing for [time comparisons of prevalence](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Change-since-2000-1536x1536.png) pre/post turn-of-the-century that show which stereotypes are going away and which persist (or are growing).  A quick look suggests that damsel-in-distress is on the way out, but slut shaming has stuck around more (although I don't know if that's still true in 2015+).  I think this could be a useful, if imprecise, way of measuring progress in eroding harmful stereotypes.  It could also highlight whether there are some areas where outdated views persist.  However, I have some concerns on the reliability of this dataset.  I wouldn't take it as literal truth, but more as one decent indicator.

Do people think this is a useful endeavor?  Is the data from TVTropes reliable enough, representative enough?  Are there other large-scale methods that have attempted categorize stereotype prevalences (or similar) in media?",1

How to fight back against normalisation of anti-women terrorism?,"Every woman - especially those who dared to speak out against misogyny in some form - experienced this. Men who create multiple accounts, to hound them, send them rape/death threats, how they want to stalk them online + offline and mutilate their bodies, men who invade women's spaces online and try to silence women by taking over the discussion, men who make anti-women jokes, men who then silence them by calling them overreacting and crazy. 

In the world of the internet, doing those deranged things has become very easy. And as excuses, we always hear that we ""need a thicker skin"", and ""it's not that bad"". But it is. 

The terror women face online (and offline) becomes increasingly more drastic by the day. Male supremacist terrorist groups like Incels, MGTOW, PUA, MRA, are recruiting and advertising more successfully on Social Media, Youtube, etc., reaching millions of followers. And boys who grew up with the internet and other male dominated areas (gaming, tech field) are socialised with these ideas from a very young age and think of it as normal. And even the popular p0rn categories are changing, and drifting from intercourse to abuse/mutilation/humiliation/murder/torture of women. 

We can't report it as a hate crime, as misogyny isn't even a category in most countries. We can't go to the police, as creating and deleting fake, anonymous accounts on reddit and other online platforms is a matter of 3 seconds. We can't go to our supervisors and principals, since no serious consequences are going to happen anyway. 

And I'm tired of those terrorist groups counting on the fact that we as women are soft and empathetic anyway, that we would always try to ""understand"" them, no matter how much they hate, molest, groom, assault, or straight-up slaughter us, and the security that we as women would never do those deranged things to them anyway. And what pissess me off most is how much these things are normalised and engrained in our culture already. 

How can we as women de-normalise these things? How can we defend ourselves? How can we fight back effectively? I'm personally feeling really powerless.",1
Is it mansplaining if an actual subject matter expert speaks in a condescending tone to a woman person ignorant in the subject?," [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k870cg2E4LM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k870cg2E4LM)

Can a man be condescending to a woman without it being mansplaining?,"Just a question regarding definitions I had. I believe I understand the general idea of mansplaining decently well- here's my understanding: Women are generally (ofc. incorrectly) assumed to be inferior, less competent, less knowledgeable etc. and so it's sexist when a man unnecessarily explains something to a woman, especially if it's something women are expected to know much more about. 

My question is, how does that differ from just being condescending? Does a man being condescending to a woman always carry the connotation that the man expected/expects inferiority due to gender, consciously or not? Or is it not about the intent or the man's thought process at all, and is ""mansplaining"" just used to express the frustration of being talked down to by men in a world that is condescending to women, regardless of whether a particular incident was motivated by sexism or not?",1

How do/would you deal with rage release from random misogynists?,"In Japan, in a crowded place like a station and department store, there are misogynists who intentionally walk into women, and shove them away. I was recently victimized by three of them, respectively at a station, shopping mall, and in front of another station. The two of them came from behind, walked into me, and hit the right side of my back. The one came from my right side while I was looking up at the electronic arrival departure board, and shoved me away. I'm an average-sized woman, they were average-sized men, and it hurt.

None of 'em apologized, slowed down or stopped to check if I was okay, but just quickly walked away. I didn't say anything to them, because I was shocked, and also the people who show that level of savageness are total pieces of shit that never deserve any kind of my attention, energy, or time.

My anger towards them lingered on for a few days, not because of the physical pain, but because of their cowardliness and dirtiness: they targeted an innocent civilian who is smaller/weaker than them, and attacked her blind spots. (It is said in Japan that those cruel misogynists target pregnant women, women with strollers, and ones who look timid, dress modestly with less/no makeup ‚Äîthey never target someone like Tyra Banks)

I'm not a type of person who yells in public: 'You fucking asshole!"" or even ""Hey, you shoved me!!"" This may be the exact reason that they target me.

How do you know that the men are going to talk about sexist things? - In general human beings feel more comfortable with people who are similar to themselves, be it gender, race, language, or nationality.  In any case, even if they were to say sexist things, how is it anyone's business what anyone does outside of work - unless a crime is being committed, which can actually be prosecuted in the court of law? How would you even know that the male employees are having a boys night out, unless you are surveilling them or tracking their movements, and tracking what they say and do? 

2\] What is your take on the issue that girls can join boy scouts but the opposite is very problematic. Are safe spaces a concept only available to women? As an extension, do you think that women hanging around with other women is okay, but men should hang around with at least one women outside of work?

Objectification from the other side (and other questions),"Hey, so I had a couple of questions, based on some recent posts on this subreddit.

1\]  Can/do women get distracted in the workplace by something that men wear / do? If so, is it like specific clothing, parts of body, or something else entirely \[voice?\]? It's just that movies generally discuss objectification from the male side, so don't really know about the other side.

2\] Do you think ""locker room talk"" and ""boys will be boys"" is more prevalent in coed schools? I go to an all boys boarding school, and we never had something like ""locker room talk"" scenario \[could just be an anomaly though\].

3\] Do you think single sex school education is better for males? I personally am doing extremely well in an all boys school \[both grades and extracurriculars\], and connecting well with my teachers, as compared to my dismal performance before middle school when I was in a coed school - I was also considered a problem child there.",1
What can I do about locker room talk?,"Hello, this is my first post on this subreddit. I'm not sure if this should be posted here or r/MensLib but I've wanted to share my thoughts and experiences for quite some time.

I (18m) am a senior in high school and have been involved in various sports and extracurriculars throughout my last 4 years. I can say with certainty that my experiences have been generally positive. However, sometimes I feel uncomfortable when locker room talk occurs. Especially when the topic is about girls who go to our school. While I do my best to not participate, at times I catch myself lying about what I truly believe in only to fetch a few laughs. My efforts to change the topic or even out right end conversation almost always fall flat. I've tried conveying my perspective to 1 on 1s with my teammates, but their tendency reverts back over time. 

Is there a solution, method, or idea that could help me lessen the amount of locker room talk that occurs? If this is societal, what would be the first step towards a positive future?",1
Thoughts on the gendering of political parties?,"In US politics, the two political parties are often analogized (sometimes subliminally) using maternal and paternal characteristics. The ‚Äúmother‚Äù (see Democrats or left leaning) is perceived to have feminine priorities focused more on the people, while the ‚Äúfather‚Äù (Republican/conservative) is more focused on international or security affairs. Or whatever. 

Personally I‚Äôve always hated this comparison because 1) it‚Äôs too complicated to be so binary and heteronormative, and 2) it just further stigmatizes liberal issues, particularly anything that could even remotely benefit women. However, in context to what we‚Äôre seeing in present day (the blatant normalization of gaslighting, corruption, and lying on the side typically equated to masculinity) I‚Äôm starting to maybe understand why people who hold certain ideas towards women may be the ones who don‚Äôt see an issue with this type of behavior. Seems like there could be a direct correlation between people who are more likely to hold gross, victim blamey views about domestic violence and also dismiss the current actions of Trump, McConnell, and the Republican Party writ large.

Do you think it gives credence to the mother Democrat/father Republican figures used to explain boilerplate differences between the parties? Does it extend to other things? What are your thoughts? Thanks in advance!",1

When is anger the appropriate response?,"As my title stated, I don't know when anger is the appropriate response when someone (usually a guy) makes an offensive and/or sexist remark made in public, instead of educating them.

I understand that it is exhausting to educate people when it is your identity being attacked or questioned. But consider the following:

1) Information about the feminist movement isn't as accessible as people claim. Sure, it's on the internet and people can search it, but not everyone (especially in a third-world country) has access to the internet. And if they do have access to the internet, the references are usually in English and not in their local language or dialect, which means they still won't be able to access the information.

2) Once they were civilly (as in calmly explained why it's offensive and asked not to do it again) called out for their offensive language/behavior, the men in question were willing to make an effort to be less offensive because they were coming from a place of ignorance (see point 1).  When they were angrily (as in publicly shamed and shouted at) called out for their offensive language/behavior, the men in question just got angry as well.

Note, that I know that not all men who get called out for being offensive try to make themselves into better people. I would get angry at them too if I see similar offensive behavior from them after I've made an effort to educate them on why they're offensive.

I personally feel that being angry at ignorance isn't the best way to deal with offensive language/behavior (unless it's repeated behavior, then ignorance isn't an excuse). I understand it's difficult to assume that they're being ignorant, but I would rather first assume that when men's behavior/language becomes offensive, it was a mistake instead of being deliberate. 

(I would like to add that English is not my first language, and I'm not saying that anger is not a valid response. It's absolutely valid. I just feel that sometimes there are more appropriate responses.)",1
Financial Independence,"So this guy on Twitter was talking about ' Running it up till my wife can say ‚Äòa jobbb, I‚Äôm married??‚Äô and it immediately made me uncomfortable because for me personally, a man could be a billionaire, I am not comfortable being financially dependent on anyone and besides I like the career I want to get into one day.

But MANY women were appreciating it and asking for more men to have that mentality. I saw similar posts saying that its sexist for women to be expected to take financial responsibility while they don't have equal rights and its in fact empowering and feministic to not settle for men who don't make enough money (Lets not get into the classist implications of these) and work for them? Is it?  I am so confused.",1
"How to ""believe all women"" but also support Joe Biden (possible TW?)","I'm struggling to reconcile the facts that I genuinely like Joe Biden but he does have a sexual assault allegation against him (Tara Reade). As a woman, feminist and a survivor myself, I want to believe Tara by default, so I'm trying to think in a dialectal manner: Biden could have assaulted Reade in the 90s, but he has changed and is a good person now. But I worry that, by holding these two possible truths, I am actively participating in rape culture and condoning sexual assault.

So my question is: Do you believe that someone who assaulted a woman can change and become a good person? Is it ever permissible to then support that person?

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I'm exhausted so I'm sorry if this is poorly written!

Edit: I‚Äôm not saying I support everything Biden stands for. As someone mentioned, he supported the Hyde Amendment for a long time, and I find that disgusting. I don‚Äôt agree w his,
and most Americans‚Äô, kink for capitalism. But still, I don‚Äôt want to condemn him fully for his past bc, imo, people can change. I used to be ignorant af (I won‚Äôt go into what that entailed bc I am ashamed of it) but then I went to college in a big city and learned about the real world and other ways of thinking. I hope that people can see how different I am now and not write me off immediately for how I was in the past.
I would also like to add that (and this is probably going to be a lot of identifying info about me) I went to Georgetown and lived in that neighborhood. I went to the same movie theater and ice cream shop that Biden goes to. There‚Äôs a photo of him (not like a photo op thing, like a passerby took the photo) speaking w a man experiencing homelessness outside of the AMC, and as someone who worked w people experiencing homelessness in the Gtown neighborhood, I really was touched by that. People experiencing homelessness get thrown to the wayside and ignored, as if they‚Äôre not human. But Biden took time to acknowledge this man‚Äôs existence and say ‚ÄúI see you.‚Äù Most people won‚Äôt even look at a person experiencing homelessness  or say hello when they pass by. The fact that Biden did just that shows hella character in my opinion.",1
Does anyone else feel the 'strong female' characters on Netflix shows are terribly written?,"So i don't really identify as a feminist , but i feel that the recent trend of incorporating 'strong female' characters on shows is actually not what it looks like bcuz most of the characters on the shows are terribly written , they seem to portray powerful women as bitchy and complaining , basically they all look like what your typical 50 year old male thinks when he visualises feminist or strong woman.

"What's up with calling women ""sweet""?","Hi everyone! I'm doing a long overdue deep dive into feminism and there's something that's been bugging me that I can't figure out. I was wondering if anyone had feminist insight or suggested readings/media on it. I'm a late-comer so apologies if it's basic.

I've noticed that I get praised a lot for being ""sweet"" but at the same time often told that I'm too sweet and that makes me weak. I'm told this most often by boyfriends. So, when I'm kind and understanding to a boyfriend or someone he thinks deserves it, I'm so great. But, if I'm kind and understanding with someone he thinks doesn't deserve it, I'm too nice and need to stand up for myself. The other inconsistency with this is kindness or sweetness appears to be a quality that is appreciated in me, as a woman and a girlfriend, but not something that is an aspiring universal characteristic. What I mean by this is, a boyfriend will see sweetness as my best trait, but will not see it as a trait that is important for him to emulate. So, it's great that I'm patient and kind but a man will make no effort to be so and does not desire to be so. I've even seen this represented in media. For example, I saw a T.V. show where one of the characters said to his wife that she is so kind and that's his favorite thing about her. But, she's too kind and that's why she needs him to protect her.  This was the line that ended a disagreement between them about how to proceed with a moral dilemma.  

If I praise a characteristic in another person, it's something I admire, wish I had and strive to be better at. Given all the inconsistencies with an individual's and society's perception of sweetness, I can't shake the feeling of being patronized and disrespected when it's brought up, even in a positive manner. Something feels insidious when the characteristic my partner values the most in me is a characteristic he also tells me is a weakness and is something he doesn't value in himself. Thanks in advance for any help!",1
Workplace dress code and sexism,"Got into a heated discussion with my friends with regards to this

Basically I am a guy and I work in the banking and finance industry and I notice that many ladies are dressing increasingly in a manner that I feel is beginning to feel uncomfortable in terms of how revealing it is. I am taking about bare backs or skirts with slits. Or extremely short skirts that I would associate with a club. This happens all the time and even more so on a casual friday

So I mentioned that why don't we have the same professional standards in terms of dress codes for guys and girls? Even for casual Fridays some level of decorum should be observed. 

My stance was that too revealing clothing could distract (I know in am ideal world Ur colleagues should not objectify you but we don't live in an ideal world). This creates a safe environment for both men and women. Women don't get objectified. Everyone focuses on their work and go home. 

The immediate response was that I was sexist and misogynistic. Their stance was women should be free to wear whatever they want. It's my own fault for being disturbed. 

So I am conflicted. If men are supposed to follow a certain standards why is it misogynistic to suggest the same for ladies at a workplace? I mean men can't exactly wear revealing outfits at work at all. 

Another argument they put is that dressing doesn't affect how professional a person is. But I find that this arguement is irrelevant as it applies for both gender. I mean in that case men should be able to wear anything they want too. And we all know men can't exactly go to work in berms etc either 

So the question is: should there be a professional limit to how revealing a workplace dress code should be? Should men and women have the same standard and expectations with regards to dress code?",1

Understanding part of an article about masculinity and misogyny in 2000s emo/pop punk,"I read [this](https://themuse.jezebel.com/the-miserable-business-of-emo-masculinity-1845304316) really interesting article the last night and it makes a lot of really good points. There's one section that I just don't understand, though. I wanted to ask people on here about it because I thought the rest of the article was very reasonable and I am a man who has minimal experience with feminist thought. The part I was confused by was about halfway through the article, and the text is:

&gt; Hayley Williams, as stated previously, is an obvious exception, though she, too, was not immune to those cultural oppressions, as evidenced in ‚ÄúMisery Business.‚Äù ‚Äúi‚Äôm a proud feminist, just maybe not a perfect one?‚Äù¬†she wrote in 2015, apologizing for the song‚Äôs ‚Äúvery narrow-minded perspective.‚Äù It‚Äôs worth noting that she is one of very few emo performers of the time that have apologized for their less-than-savory songwriting, and I can‚Äôt help but think that as one of the few women in the scene, she‚Äôs been tasked with carrying the brunt of it. For example: Daryl Palumbo of Glassjaw¬†told¬†Alternative Press¬†in 2017, after¬†Pitchfork‚Äôs Jenn Pelly¬†brought up the lyrics¬†to ‚ÄúPretty Lush,‚Äù that when he wrote the song he was ‚Äúa young guy, and I was supposed to be a man and I was not. I apologize for saying any of that... I was small-minded when I should‚Äôve been a man,‚Äù reinforcing an idea that goodness, doing the right thing, owning up to mistakes‚Äîis an expression of manliness, what is masculine. It also continues to refuse to give agency to the women he villainized.

I don't really understand the author's interpretation of Pelly's quote. To me the quote reads like a fine apology, but it seems like she's using it to demonstrate that Williams is being held to a higher standard (""she‚Äôs been tasked with carrying the brunt of it""). I also don't understand how this quote ""continues to refuse to give agency to the women he villainized"", or why ""reinforcing an idea that goodness, doing the right thing, owning up to mistakes‚Äîis an expression of manliness, what is masculine"" is a bad thing. Have I misunderstood how she's using the quote from the interview, or am I lacking the perspective to see why the quote is so egregious?",1

Why don‚Äôt we talk about female veterans more?,"It‚Äôs Veterans Day! First of all, happy vets day to all my sisters. 

Women veterans are a group of people that is often overlooked. As a woman veteran, I personally dislike this holiday because of how overlooked we are. I‚Äôve seen many women veterans discriminated against both within and outside of the veteran community. 

Here‚Äôs a small example: Today, I went out with my friends to celebrate Veterans Day. We went to a restaurant that offers free meals to all veterans. When it was my time to order, the waiter actually refused to accept my status. He said that they do not give meals to spouses. I showed him my veteran ID, and he stated that it was ‚Äúfake‚Äù. For the record, I am a veteran who served in Afghanistan, female, 25 years old, and overweight. I don‚Äôt look like what people imagine vets look like (Middle Aged white men wearing a baseball cap with various attention-seeking embellishments).

Within the veteran community and during interpersonal interactions, people often ask me to ‚Äúprove‚Äù my service. They‚Äôll ask me to show them my ID or other identifying paperwork. Which is weird... because if you tell someone that you worked at Amazon, do they insist on employee identification, or do they just take your word for it?

Also, the VA itself does the absolute bear minimum for its female veterans. I have to drive 2 hours to see a gyno, when I live right next to a VA facility. Why? Because they don‚Äôt bother having a woman‚Äôs health clinic in all of their facilities.",1

The Dreaded Thermostat 2: The Revenge Reloaded,"Thought of just asking a light weight question. I work in an office with 1-2 other coworkers. My bossman isn't here everyday, so lots of the times it's me and my coworker (18F). Anyway, we have a little bit of a non-serious conflict. She likes the room temp to be 78. I prefer it to be 71. I remember learning that on a physical level, males and females do seem to have different temperature preferences. When she first started working here, I was like 'holy crap it's hot in here' and turned it down to 72. She said that she was basically freezing. So we compromised, I bought a small desk fan and we agreed that 75F was the temperature we would work in. 

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, this isn't about seeking advice. I'm just curious if feminists here encounter a similar problem. Is it always cold where you work? Do you wear jackets and coats at work? What experiences have you had with the thermostat. If you have issues, do they extend to the home or is this a work culture issue?

Is it ethical/okay to masturbate to pictures of celebrities and other public figures?,"Hi yall, I just had a question about masturbating to celebrities and other public figures. I know that it is not uncommon for people to masturbate to them, but I don't think that's a reason for it being ethical/okay (popular =/= right). I was wondering what yall's thoughts were.

My thinking is that celebrities and other public figures don't necessarily consent to their pictures being sexualized and used for the purpose of masturbation. There's a lack of consent, and it seems unethical and disrespectful then to masturbate to pictures of them. Like I do understand that they post pictures in the public, so they then consent to the public viewing it. But that doesn't necessarily mean that they consent to people masturbating to it. Then again, when someone does masturbate to them, the celebrity/public figure doesn't know. Not sure how to make of this.

I was also thinking about a related scenario, about how it is disrespectful to masturbate to people you know and other friends. Like for people you know, it's objectifying and creepy to masturbate to pictures that they post like that. And I guess I'm asking, is there a difference between friends and celebrities here? Like if it isn't okay to masturbate to people you know, why would it be then acceptable/okay to masturbate to people you don't know. Is there any distinction in the first place?

"What do you think of women who claim to be okay with abortion, but then characterize pro-choice as being only pro-abortion?","Today I came across a video on TikTok made by a woman who claims to be a women‚Äôs rights advocate as well as an advocate for LGBTQ people. The video that she created was one where she said that pro-choice people are only pro abortion, and it was confusing because she claims to be a women‚Äôs rights advocate who has no problem with abortions. Though, she consistently demonizes people who believe that abortions should be a route that women/ trans-men can take if they want to. It seems that she consistently uses pro life rhetoric when talking about pro-choice people, and also uses trans-men as a shield when she‚Äôs called out on that. She says that she is not pro-life because she supports women and trans-men getting sterilized. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what to say in order to combat her rhetoric that pro-choice people only ever push for abortions. I know that this isn‚Äôt true, because every pro-choice person I know advocates for all of it being legal and accessible (abortion, birth control, and sterilization). She pushes the narrative that pro-choice people want everyone to just have abortions as birth control instead of advocating for sterilization and birth control, which is obviously untrue.

"As a Gender &amp; Women‚Äôs studies major, how do I deal with the comments I get for pursuing such a stigmatized degree?","I‚Äôm an undergraduate student pursuing a GWS major at a prestigious university, and while my friends and family have both been extremely supportive, I still run into plenty of criticism and rude comments about how ‚Äúuseless‚Äù my degree is, and/or why it isn‚Äôt lucrative. While I agree the job prospects after graduation aren‚Äôt as plentiful as they would be for a STEM major or medical school, I have two highly successful family members who had majored in history and English, respectively, and both ended up with great careers, albeit in completely different fields. 

While I firmly believe the subject matter is important, and that most of the criticisms I face are based off of ignorance and stereotypes, I‚Äôd be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt make me doubt myself from time to time.

"Gender - a product of nurture, not nature","Is it a prerequisite of calling oneself a feminist to believe that gender is socially conditioned?

My theory is the victory in a war determines who will rule, and at some point in time matriarchial governments lost to patriarchial ones, consistently.

With many world governments becoming feminist \[except some like China\], do you think feminists will be able to topple governments in the future? How will you fare against military dictatorships in a civil war? Also, do you think feminists would be able to seize control in China/Russia/India/Middle-East one day?

Also, if I am a man, and if what feminism says is true - that men have all the power, why should I voluntarily want to cede my power, without even a fight or a war?

My main issue is, if it was the matriarchy in power, you would have treated men the same way. Now that we have a feminist government in the US, under meToo, a woman can falsely accuse a man of sexual assault and he can directly go to jail without a trial \[happened in many universities\], because all women are to be believed. Like, how is this fair, even murderers get a fair trial. And there are also other things like Marriage / Divorce Law exploitation. Just think about this, if most college graduates today are women, and most criminals are men, and even uneducated women can earn money via marriage+divorce / onyfans+Instagram+Twitch, what's stopping uneducated young men from joining criminal organizations? Yes, you can break the glass ceiling, but you also cannot prevent the impending chaos on the floor.  ",1
Do you ever attribute anything good to the patriarchy?,"I've heard the patriarchy be blamed for just about everything wrong with society. Even when women behave in toxic ways, I've heard feminists blame toxic *masculinity* while denying the existence of toxic femininity. Everything from racism to classism to war has been blamed on the patriarchy.

Given that society has both good and bad elements, is it fair to also attribute some positive aspects of society to the patriarchy? Things like law, order, science, democracy, etc.? Granted one can say that these things could have occurred in a world without the patriarchy, but we can say the same about the negative things. Racism, classism and war could just as easily occurred under a matriarchy.

Are there positive things that can be attributed to the patriarchy? If not, why?",1

Due to the introduction of gender quotas I‚Äòve been asked to step down from co-chairing a working group. What should I do?,"I am a man and I am co-chairing this working group together with another man. The other co-chair and I represent two different organisations in the working group. The working group is part of another organisation. They decided to introduce gender quotas and asked me if my boss, who is a woman, could replace me as Co-Chair of the working group so that the gender quota is fulfilled. However in my organisation it is part of my job to represent our organisation in this working group. My boss has other responsibilities. They also said I could continue representing our organisation in the working group, but formally my woman boss would become the Co-Chair to reach the gender quota. They probably asked me to step down and not the other co-chair because he is more senior than I am. What do you think should I do?",1

Do other women feel scared running alone in public?,"Today I was talking to a friend about how I was too scared to run alone without my phone (I wouldn‚Äôt have anything to put my phone in to take with me). As the gyms are currently shut, I didn‚Äôt really have any other choice for exercise but really didn‚Äôt want to go out without someone there and was seeing if any of my friends would come with me. 

I‚Äôm sure most women have experienced at some point being harassed and cat called in public. Even with other people with you or around it still happens. My friend then says he doesn‚Äôt think running alone is a risk and women shouldn‚Äôt be scared as kidnappings and sexual assault doesn‚Äôt happen much, especially in the area we live in. Upon googling it, I found an article on a 15 year old girl had been kidnapped and raped in our area, published 3 days ago. I told him this and he didn‚Äôt believe me and asked to have a look at the article. He then read through and said ‚Äúthis says he was charged but never proven‚Äù (which I later found out it never said in the article but anyway...). I let him know stuff like this was hard to prove and it‚Äôs very unlikely this 15 year old child was making it up. To which he then said ‚Äúwell it is a definite possibility‚Äù. 

This is what really bothered me as false rape allegations are only 2%-4% of all rape cases. I let him know this, but he said I was wrong and ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt talk about things I know nothing about‚Äù. 

I finished the conversation there but this really upset and annoyed me. I wanted to see if anyone agreed with me that this whole thing is ridiculous and that women have so many reasons to be scared to go out alone, especially without a phone. There is never a 100% chance of being safe, and even though I would love to be in a world where I could go for a run and feel completely not at risk, I sadly don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a possibility in today‚Äôs day and age.",1

Girl/gal seems infantilizing and besides it has an upper age limit, chick/darling/honey/love is patronizing/sexual.

wlw in patriarchy,"Okay this is probably not quite the right subreddit but I trust you guys and honestly couldn't find a better suited place for this question. Would appreciate any direction towards other subreddits that might be more directly related to my question.

So: I recently admitted to myself that I am bi. And now I can't stop thinking about how patriarchy has shaped my perspective on other women. Like I know I have always found women attractive but there's also the over-sexualisation of women everywhere and the competition (especially looks-wise) between women that has influenced how I percieve other women. For the past 10 years whenever I looked at a woman my first thought was ""oh but is she skinnier/prettier than me"" instead of idk appreciating her beauty individually. 

And now as I am coming to terms with my sexuality and society I am looking for any content (books, podcasts, youtube videos..) discussing this (as I am surely not the first or only person to struggle with this), either on a personal experience level or a more societal/cultural level.

I know that a movement must be in constant *movement*. But I genuinely regard the past of an ideology of being the most crucial part of it, it cements bases, reasons and legitimacy, that being done by the rejection of said past (race-segmented upper-class feminism) the celebration of it (female suffrage, educational desegregation, reproductive rights, etc) or the continuation of it (the fight for equal rights).

A question about Monogamy and Sex,"To start, I would describe myself as a forward thinking, progressive socialist and intersectional feminist man. 

I've recently been pondering inceldom and how this community, naturally made up of mostly broken or lonely men, believes that women hold power and privilege over them by being attractive and having sexual power, despite women being conditioned by men to be the gatekeepers of sex per gender roles and societal tradition, i.e. ""the patriarchy"". 

However I had ran into a question that made me rethink things. I thought to myself: if I'm as gender abolitionist and a strong believer in a free, consensual, safe and positive sex world where both men and women of all types hold power, is monogamy a bad personal value/practice to hold? Like polycules and taboo relationships (within general reason) are at the forefront of being liberating for both men and women and yet I'm still subscribed to notions of a loyal, traditional relationship where it is me and my one solitary partner. Essentially, I still get jealous, believe in the concept of cheating, etc. 

To be honest I think I've just thought about the overall topic too much but I thought the question wasn't-- awful. So I thought I'd post it here. 

Tl;dr is monogamy sexist/a bad value to hold as a self described progressive?

I'm concerned I'm becoming a TERF. Would like insight,"Hey guys. I want to start this off by saying I promise I am coming at this from a place of good faith-- I am not here to concern troll or play obtuse to push an agenda. My questions come from a sincere place of wanting to understand, and my doubts are genuinely ones I wish to clear up. On top of that, I've identified as nonbinary and used they/them pronouns for the past few years. I still want to continue doing that, but being AFAB *has* always been very important in my view of my identity &amp; I've spent most of my time in queer spaces in WLW ones.

Recently, I've found my way to gender critical corners of the internet and I've found myself troubled with how much it seems to... make sense? A *lot* of what people have said they believe seems like either a purposeful misinterpretation of their discourse or a complete fabrication. I want to be able to discuss them somewhere where I can air out all of my thoughts and honestly work through them. I think it's dangerous to be unable to hold your beliefs up to scrutiny &amp; would much rather have a discussion on my thoughts, rather than internalize them. I'm using a throwaway because I'm vaguely nervous (I know it does not inspire confidence).

Now, let's get out of the way all the ways I *don't* agree with terfs. 

* **I believe trans women can still meaningfully experience misogyny.** Trans women who pass are treated, by all accounts and purposes, the same as cis women. People don't bother checking your genitals before proceeding forth. More on this + especially more on passing later.

* **Transphobia is a thing that exists.** More than anything, what I believe in is looking at the material results as indicators for what theory should be. Theory that has absolutely no substance outside of hypothetical conversations is meaningless. Looking at people's lived experiences, I can say with certainty that transphobia exists and significantly impacts people's lives. Trans people are at heightened risk for assault + verbal abuse,  the trans youth suicide rate, etc etc. 

* **Trans women cannot neatly be placed in the same class as cis men.** The lived experiences of trans women are markedly &amp; observably different than cis men. They are not afforded the same privileges in society when presenting as trans women, trans people do not occupy the highest positions of power, and the societal systems set up to benefit cis men often actively harm trans women. Grouping up cis men and trans women does not make sense when you are analyzing things through the lens of lived experience.

* **Bathrooms are really not a problem**. Don't really know what else ought to be said here. There does not seem to be a particular pattern of trans women assaulting cis women in bathrooms. 


With that being said, here are the things that seem to make a relative amount of sense to me &amp; that I agree with:

* **Sex-based oppression exists.** The way societies interact with you depends heavily on what you are assigned at birth, which again, correlates nearly 1:1 to what genitalia you have. Abortion rights, menstruation, absolutely everything about the degrading way vaginas are treated, are issues solely faced by people with female or AFAB reproductive systems, whatever terminology you want to apply. Medical science is hugely focused on the male body &amp; thus the specific ways illness &amp; disease manifests in females is left direly unknown. Issues that are female specific, like endometriosis, are ridiculously under-researched despite the massive percentage of people it affects. Sex selective abortions exist. There is no way, for me, to deny that AMAB bodies are privileged over AFAB ones. 

* **Trans women do not face sex based oppression &amp; I am rather conflicted on if cis women meaningfully oppress trans women**. I think what has become enlightening in how misogyny is framed for me, is understanding that passing trans women face misogyny *because* of the assumption they have a vagina. Misogyny is deeply rooted in the assumption of a female body &amp; is almost inextricable from that. Amongst anti-GC people, I have seen this point + the previous one framed as 'terfs reducing women down to their bodies' but I find this to be a profoundly misleading and borderline dishonest reading. It's not reducing people down to their biology to observe how they're treated by society. I think people take 'trans women do not experience sex-based oppression' to be a *prescriptive* statement barring trans women from accessing something, but I find it to be more of a *descriptive*, value-neutral explanation. What makes me doubtful about my own understanding of what gender critical beliefs actually entail, is that I have often read claims that the gender critical crowd 'define womanhood by ability to make babies' but this understanding of sex based oppression is pointedly... not that? Not only is it reductive, but it seems actively misogynistic to see talking about sex-based oppression &amp; vaginas through the lens of ""making babies,"" as if that is the only context the female reproductive system exists in. To automatically go from lets discuss how female reproductive systems are treated by society to 'making babies' is.... bad. 

* Onto explaining my thoughts of cis women not being oppressors-- cis womanhood is in itself oppressive. Sex based oppression means that having a vagina... can in no way truly be a privilege, imo. I think this is particularly true in non-Western countries. Cis women do not *meet* patriarchal standards of womanhood by having a vagina, they are *subjected* to them. While cis women and trans women both face different struggles, I do not see any way that the constructs &amp; systems of gender/sex benefit cis women over trans women. The trans murder rate is actually rather comparable to the rate at which cis women are murdered every year. Analyzing the statistics is important to understand the source of material harm.  *80%* of the trans women murdered in 2019 were TWOC, and specifically impoverished women of color who are sex workers. Trans women of color, in particular black and Latina transfeminine people, are disproportionately at risk but the axis their oppression is coming from seems to be deeply embedded in poverty &amp; racism. White trans women are insulated from this unique harm. 

* **Female and male socialization do occur &amp; this extends to trans people.** I am AFAB. Being AFAB deeply affected how I was raised, how I was spoken to, the expectations that were put upon me-- literally every aspect of me is shaped by this. I do not think trans women experience female socialization, and I do not understand any argument that they do. Even if a trans woman may have internalized messages about what women are expected to be like, this is an internal experience instead of an external one. A trans woman does not go through the external experience of female socialization-- it is more than notions you accept about womanhood, but the manner in which people interact with you, the interests that the adults around you sought to cultivate in you, the way in which society treats you. I actually think this line of reasoning clearly represents a disconnect in these sorts of conversations-- the internal reality vs the external reality. Gender critical thought seems to prioritizing the external. 

* -&gt; I have seen trans women who said they experienced female socialization because they were seen as effeminate men but that is... not the same? Effeminate men are not treated similarly to women, at all. It seems to be a misunderstanding of female socialization, that what it represents is 'the way you are treated when you're feminine' instead of 'the way you are treated when you're AFAB.' Moreso, it discounts non-feminine AFAB people &amp; bizarrely denies them the right to discuss female socialization by framing it around personal behavior instead of how society treats you.

* **I am not certain cis womanhood &amp; trans womanhood is similar enough to place in the same class.** To loop back to my point earlier on how I don't think trans women belong in the same class as cis men, but simultaneously, I think trans womanhood is sufficiently different enough from cis womanhood that it does them both a disservice to place them in the same class. I don't think it provides coherent analysis. Like... the framework of the childhood of a cis &amp; trans girl (or anyone AFAB) are fundamentally different. For example, many trans women talk about the experience of wanting to do feminine things but not being allowed to because of societal gender roles. This is intrinsically not the experience of anyone AFAB- even if an AFAB person was shamed for being feminine, it is not on the same terms as an AMAB person. As an AFAB person, you are not shamed for being feminine because you're not living up to gender standards and you are emasculating yourself, but because femininity is frivolous, because AFAB people are frivolous. Conversely, growing up a tomboy is inherently not something AMAB will go through-- even if they had purportedly ""tomboy"" interests, because it's not merely the internal experience, but the external, material experience of living through society &amp; how it behaves towards you.  

* -&gt; I recognize the argument against this is 'not all women had identical childhoods, another axis of oppression will impact how you navigate through the world, i.e a rich woman and a poor woman, etc.' I have considered that, but the rebuttal that makes most sense to me is 'those are *separate* factors that affect gender, whilst this is about is about the fundamental nature of gender. The ways that a poor woman &amp; a rich woman would differ in their experience of sex &amp; gender are related to the distinct, separate socioeconomic factors that cause them to contend with gender differently, while the ways trans women and cis women differ is on the base experience of gender itself. 

* **Trans women who do not pass experience transphobia, but not misogyny.** I actually think that what trans women experience is more analogous to homophobia than it is misogyny. Often the harm that comes with trans women is not based on misogyny, but on the assumptions about gender nonconforming men. The way it manifests, the language and slurs used, the specific type of violence that arises all correlate with &amp; are more coherently described by homophobia rather than misogyny. Of course, oppression is not so cleanly cut &amp; homophobia is itself deeply intertwined with misogyny. To go out on a limb, I am not sure if internalized misogyny is a coherent system to discuss trans women in the context of, because much of internalized misogyny is wrapped up in female socialization. 

* **Gender abolition is the end goal.** I do not think there is any 'essence' of womanhood. I think that being trans exists because well, gender is around, and the people have gotta deal with it somehow. Blaming the systems of gender on trans people is pointing the gun in the wrong direction. Regardless, I believe it bears some... analysis on a wider societal scale on what it means when someone thinks of herself as woman specifically because she is more feminine. I suppose I do agree with the gender critical people when they say it has become dogmatic to not critically discuss this. I have realized that I feel uncomfortable when people talk about passing or presenting female by prescribing a list of gender roles, or when people say they knew they were a girl because they never enjoyed ""boy"" activities. What does this *mean* about what it means to be a woman.

* **I have observed a certain amount of fetishists in the community.** This is the point I am most concerned about when I say I worry I am absorbing TERF beliefs. I really hesitate to even say this, because I truly don't believe all trans women are fetishists &amp; I do not want to contribute to harm against them. But as someone who is nonbinary(????) &amp; has hung out in a lot of online trans spaces, I do... recognize? a certain demographic of people. I have seen a not-insignificant amount of trans woman say degrading &amp; misogynistic things about vaginas &amp; women in general, in a way I distinctly haven't seen in transmasc spaces. I don't necessarily want to dwell on the specifics because I'm don't wish to turn this stuff into a peanut gallery. I am also not here to write off every single trans women for the crimes of minority- a misogynistic cis woman is as common as a day ending in y. I don't know. My thoughts are jumbled here. Maybe this is linked to the extent in which trans women are sexualized in all media they appear in.

* To digress a little, I actually think nonbinary people are doing gender abolition in a better &amp; more material way than terfs are. Nonbinary people who say 'fuck it, this rock is my gender' are doing a better job upending the system and the notion that gender is a meaningful category. I wish this was coming with more discussions of sex-based oppression, however, which I find has been completely removed from the conversation.

* **Genital preferences are not transphobic.** I'm putting this at the bottom of this list because I think terfs severely overrepresent this as an issue. Most trans people who are not extremely online agree with this. The vast majority of trans people don't seem to think of genital preferences as transphobic but I do agree there is a strain in online discourse where people believe this. Same goes for trans people in sports. 

Whew. This is getting long. I probably have even more to say, but I'll cut myself off here. Once again, I really want to stress that I'm not concern trolling, I just have nowhere to go with these thoughts &amp; I wanted to have genuine insight from people who are not TERFs. Please let me know if there's a better subreddit to post to than this one! I know this is less of a question, and more of a word-vomit asking for feedback.

Also I would love to have a feminist point of view about women‚Äôs representation in movies and tv series because it‚Äôs what I am majoring in college. 
So I wondered where to start in order to be a good feminist and I would really love some advice, particularly about books both on women‚Äôs representation but primarily to learn the very base of feminism. Every other advice is much appreciated!

"To my fellow feminists, what do you think of Amy Chua‚Äôs ‚ÄúIdentity Politics‚Äù?","Parenting style aside (which I personally find very damaging on a wide spectrum), I‚Äôm keen to know what people think of her take on [identity politics](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/01/how-americas-identity-politics-went-from-inclusion-to-division).

I completely understand how it can potentially be divisive, but I haven‚Äôt researched the subject enough. My background is in Human Development and how SES affect people, as well as other factors such as race and gender. At face value, I think my biggest worry would be civil rights taking a backseat in politics.

I have some questions about feminism in the US (I am european),"What is meant by ""white feminism""? I read this a lot in the context of the election, I don't really get it. Does it mean liberal feminism? bourgeoise feminism? is it really meant as ethnopluralism? Or is it just a political battle term? I get that most poor people in the US are BIPoC (so this is not a clear rich, poor thing) but don't we in general have to think feminism international.
Some people in my country say that the term ""race"" in american englisch, has a different meaning then our word for race in our language.
I learned that there is only one race the human race and there are people with external features, that are racialized by our society\white supremicy and have to face racial oppression (structural racism, colonization etc.. and everything that comes with it for example interpersonal racism, but I think that's a different level)

On a scale of 1 to 10 how much do you feel you truly grasp the bubble men are in? Does it change your approach towards communication?,"As a dude who's gone from being completely oblivious, to being feminist...it's been kind of amazing looking back to just how blind and in a bubble I was.  And how easy it was to be blind / how much effort it took to see outside of it... even though I consider myself a very curious person.  It's been my personal experience that men and women I know just have a helluva time grasping the other's perspective because their lived day to day experience is so vastly different.  Day to day the men I know don't see or hear a lot of the issues women deal with at all, so they have a tendency to think it's more of a rare edge case thing and doubt women when it is brought up (as well as for patriarchal reasons of course).  The  women I know (even very feminist ones) can't unsee the issues, deal with them day in and day out, and feel like it's so obvious and self evident that they can't imagine how anyone can not see it and will assume any disagreement comes from a truly malicious place.  (This is not to say there aren't malicious men because of course there are.  And this is not an excuse or endorsement of bad behavior on men's part, my intent is to highlight how this affects communication around feminism. )   


Having been in the bubble I feel like it really changes my approach when trying to convert other men. I'm like damn, how am I gonna convince them this is a real thing, when I know just how hard it is to actually see it unless they are under certain conditions.  And when they resist a feminist issue,  I'm more apt to say ""look I get it, it seems counterintuitive doesn't it?  But you're actually missing this big chunk of info, believe me I couldn't see it either....""  


Do you think you fully grasp it / believe in it?  Do you think it changes how you approach communicating with men and non feminists?",1

"Do feminists usually support male-only scholarships (or similar things), in fields where men are underrepresented?","To preface this with some information, I am a white man and I support female-only scholarships in fields like STEM. However, a few years ago I probably wouldn't have. I'd like to think, that I was always fairly progressive, but my views on feminism (and perhaps some others) were not. In recent years I've been trying to ""improve myself"", and educating myself on views I felt challenged on is part of that.

Now to get back to the question: 

I do believe that men-only scholarships in fields where they are underrepresented is probably a good idea, and I'm curious what you guys think about it.

I understand that (white) men are not a marginalized group, however I still believe that every field could profit from a balance in gender and race distributions (different life experiences, etc.).

I was also wondering what percentage in gender distribution, or female quotas in other areas should be the ""cut-off point"". Would, for example, a 40-60 split be enough? From what I understand and believe a huge imbalance is not natural and is caused by our cultural views. Could a small imbalance however be ""natural"" in certain fields? I'm not sure, maybe some of you could help me understand.",1

How do I explain to my professor what is wrong with a sexist meme he used to illustrate his lecture?,"I am in my first year of psychology at a Dutch university, and I saw an image being used in a lecture about research methods that struck me as being sexist and unfit for serious educational use. It was an image of a young, blonde woman making a duckface while sitting exaggeratedly dramatical on a chair and taking a selfie. The caption of the image was '' Scientists have announched a new unit to accurately measure narcissism: the selfie per hour.''I feel that this is a sexist portrayal of women, and I have decided to write my professor a letter to let him know I think it is inappropriate to use sexist jokes without adequate criticism, but I'm having a hard time explaining why exactly this image is sexist.So far I have the arguments that images like this have been used by people to falsely portray women as vain and stupid, the argument that a bigger percentage of narcissists is male, and the argument that this way of measuring is scientifically irresponsible. But I feel that I might be missing something important. Does anyone have insights on the subject?Thank you in advance for sharing your thoughts!

"Is saying ""there's not a lot of women in competitive gaming"" wrong?","Before I begin - I ask for explanation, and not for trouble. If I caused offense - I didn't know, so I will apologise for any caused in advance, and please kindly explain to me what that was.

I was watching ""The Queen's Gambit"" with my friend. In the first episode, the main character plays against a man in a room full of men (setting is 1967 Paris) and she noted that the room is full of men.

I said yeah - I guess that was the social norm back then. Come to think of it, I think there's not a lot of women in competitive gaming even now.

Upon hearing this, my friend said that there are women out there who would shred me to parts (or so to speak) for saying things like that.

So here's my first question: did I speak out of place? To me, it was stating a social norm, but can that be heard/interpreted in a different way? Please feel free to make your own assumptions about how I've said it, my tone, or facial expression, or cultures/background/professions we're from. Or even my general attitude that she may have observed other than this interaction. If it happens to be the case where I phrased this question in a way that sounded like I'm the reasonable one - it's probably because I'm the one telling the story, and missing out the part of the story where she did sound reasonable.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women\_and\_video\_games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_video_games)

&gt;Since the 1990s,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_video_games#cite_note-polygonNoGirls-1) female [gamers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer) have commonly been regarded as a minority, but industry surveys have shown that over time, the gender ratio has become closer to equal, and since the 2010s, women have been found to make up around half of all gamers. The gender ratio differs significantly between game genres, and **women are highly underrepresented in genres such as** [**first-person shooters**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter) **and** [**grand strategy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_strategy_wargame) **games.** [Sexism in video gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism_in_video_gaming), including [sexual harassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment), as well as [underrepresentation of women as characters in games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_representation_in_video_games), is an increasing topic of discussion in [video game culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_culture).

"How do we square tolerance, autonomy, and science on the subject of childhood transitioning? And can this conversation be had?","Thank you for reviewing my question. I have been struggling with this myself and I would like some feedback. If you care enough to look into my post history you will see I am a progressive intersectional feminist who supports trans rights. I did find some criticisms surrounding organizations like Mermaids to be valid, and I have struggled to arrive at a conclusion after reading several books, endless articles, etc. 


There has been a rise in children identifying as trans and a rise in the public profile of organizations like Mermaids that assist children in transitioning. 


Changing attitudes around childhood transitioning are controversial and divide feminists. 


Detransition data, particularly regarding young people, is of poor quality with few studies. There are some red flags. We can find numerous individual accounts of children detransitioning, we know that the young brain displays the most neuroplasticity, and we can say with some confidence that the recent jump in self-identifying trans children contains an appreciable number of confused or mistaken children, based on an understanding of how human populations work, and a lack of explanation for this spike that is based in sociological or biological reality. 


The laws in most places rule out hormone intervention until the mid teens, but there is an effort to deregulate this. 


How do we as feminists deal with these competing forces? Are the current laws adequate? Do we need to deregulate these choices or further regulate the process? When can a child actually consent to begin transitioning? Perhaps most importantly, how do we weigh the desires of patients and beliefs that early transitioning will be highly beneficial with the potential lifelong risks?


Edit: Thanks for the replies. I have to be away from my phone for a while and will check back later. I think this was helpful and it went better than I thought it would.

Should there be a different way to educate men on feminism?,"A lot of men seem to disregard feminism because the issues discussed at hand aren't directly experienced by them, so they assume women to be exaggerating. They find it hard to empathize with and think feminists are asking for too much. As ridiculous as that is, it's still important to get men to become feminists as they can help amplify the voices of women who aren't being heard.

A few years ago, the thing that seemed to attract me to feminism was the idea that men benefit from gender equality too. I realized that a lot of men's issues (ex. not being allowed to show emotion) was in some way related  how patriarchal our society is. On a dating related note, many men complain about women like taller men, but there has been research that it's because of unrealistic beauty standards towards women and how men feel emasculated by taller women and such. It was interesting and I think research like that can help get men on board.

I think the best way to educate men would be to discuss how issues like this can be solved so they can empathize with the gender inequality, but I'd love to hear what suggestions you have!",1
"Exploring my biases: My hang up with feminism, I believe white supremacy is more of issue than patriarchy?","I've always consider myself an anti-feminist.

I agree with Dave Chappel's analogy that the feminism seems to be about white women who are in on the heist  not likeing  about their  share of the ""take"".

Not only that, but it seems to me it is within POCs' best interest  to fight white supremacy, regardless  of gender, than patriarchy. I get  intersectionality  but even still white supremacy  is more harmful to women of color than patriarchy.  

Also, time and time again without family  white women have shown to value whiteness over  womanhood (generally  speaking). I'm not sure how women of color can fully trust women that can play both sides of the fense...

Depp Vs Heard: Thoughts Post Libel Dismissal?,"The Depp vs Heard abuse story and then libel trial have attracted a lot of attention, a lot of emotions, and a lot of conflicting information. 

Recently, a judge ruled on 14 incidents where Depp was violent to Heard, [finding 12 of the 14 incidents supported by evidence.](https://pagesix.com/2020/11/02/how-johnny-depp-judge-ruled-on-each-alleged-assault-of-amber-heard/)

I‚Äôm not educated in legal matters, especially in the UK, but it sounds like these finding were based on evidence and a chance to appeal is unlikely to be granted.

I find stories that involve celebrities and optics often show our cultural biases in how they are presented in media, and that Depp‚Äôs abuse of Heard and her subsequent public reception is indicative of how far we need to go culturally when discussing abuse, as the public sympathy seemed to swing to Depp as soon as Heard became less than perfect.

That‚Äôs my take, but I‚Äôd be interested to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts on the case as the last most popular post on the topic had OP stating Depp was the victim.

"Are fraternities becoming more progressive, and do they serve as a positive influence for young men?","I‚Äôve been in a fraternity for 4 years now and I can look back on a lot of positive ways it has affected my brothers and me, but I‚Äôve also seen negative influences go unchecked. As a queer man, I‚Äôm glad that brothers from all over the country are exposed to LGBT brothers, sometimes for the first time. I faced way less homophobia than I thought I would because of the brave gay men who came before me. When our house was smaller (25 guys total) everyone kept an eye on each other and made sure brothers weren‚Äôt taking unknown girls to their rooms alone after heavy drinking. We learned to be responsible for each other because many use college as an excuse to not be responsible for yourself. We‚Äôre repeatedly taught about the dangers of alcohol and the importance of consent. My high school didn‚Äôt teach about consent or alcohol at all so unless parents do their jobs, many young men don‚Äôt learn about consent except from feminists on the internet and we all know how much men love listening to women. 

Now my fraternity has around 100 guys in it. Most of the great guys, the positive influences, hang out in similar circles so there have been more incidents of homophobia, sexism, and just general bad behavior. A year ago we had a recent brother rape a drunk girl after she asked him to take her home. He was immediately dropped from the fraternity (unanimously) but I could tell some of the brothers just wanted to save our fraternity‚Äôs name more than condemn the behavior. 

I believe fraternities are a great avenue to teach young men valuable lessons and they‚Äôre doing a better job in the past of doing so. Maybe my fraternity is better than most, but the rape incident from two years ago is the only incident like that we‚Äôve had in decades. 

Do you believe fraternities should be abolished, reformed, or left to progress how they will?",1
How do you think hetero couples should pay for birth control?,"For condoms, I think an equal split is very fair. Both people want to have sex, both people should pay equally.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think that a 50/50 split for other methods of birth control is financially is unfair toward women. 

&amp;#x200B;

They are the ones who have to put in time and effort to find a birth control they want, go to the doctor, fill perscriptions and so on. Not to mention, that it's their bodies that have to ""pay the price"" (this sounds very dramatic, I don't necessarily mean it that way, just can't think of a different way to phrase this). Taking the pill sometimes goes fine, sometimes it fracks up a persons body. IUDs and Implanons are invasive procedures. And it's not as if they volunteered to be the ones to have to think about birth control, the system is set up in such a way that it is impossible for them not to. 

&amp;#x200B;

The men I've discussed it with have said that the system totally sucks, but it's not their fault so why should they have to contribute more financially? They would not contribute more than 50% of the cost. The partners I've had this converstaion with mostly said they'd be fine just using condoms since it's a 50/50 split. I think condoms aren't as safe (pearl index) and so that's not enough, which was met with ""well it's the birth control you want so you pay for it"". This rubs me the wrong way, since I'm the one who has to bear the brunt of the consequences if birth control fails. One also said it's \*your\* birth control, so me contributing to it at all is nice, 50% is the only fair thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think those are kind of ""out of sight, out of mind"" attitudes, which really, really annoys me. It feels like men have the priviledge not to worry as much as women, as well as the priveledge of \*never\* having to do the heavy lifting on birth control - society absolves them of that responsibility automatically because there is no male birth control. So I think it's only fair men take on the one responsibility they actually can: Paying. (Assuming people actually have the cash in general)

[META] How do you manage the hard emotions around women's involvement in male dominated fields?,"I know we don't normally navigate 'personal dilemma' questions in this sub-- but I just got some absolutely devastating news from a friend and mentee about her situation in the union she recently completed a 5 year apprenticeship to join-- and with everything else going on in the world-- this news has put me into an extremely dark place.

I feel responsible for encouraging her (and many other women) into the trades; I feel like I totally failed to protect women in my social circle-- and underneath all that, I feel deeply hopeless about my ability to protect myself and other women in my community.

I feel like there are prices we pay, as marginalized people, to 'break into' male dominated organizations and industries, but speaking from personal experience-- I was never safe in those organizations and was in many situations where the institution itself provided no means for me to address sexual harassment or hostility-- and the only thing I could do was leave that industry.

"Writing compelling/""real"" female characters.","Disclaimer: English isn't my first language.

Hi.

I'm a male, mixed-race fantasy author who's 18 years old. In my stories, I write female characters too but I was looking at post in r/badwomensanatomy and r/menwritingwomen and I was wondering if men could even write compelling or realistic female characters from a feminist perspective.If yes, could you please link me things that could help me write a good female character?

Thanks in advance!

Edit:   
So, I think I'd like to get specific here and talk about my 2 female protagonists because I'm curious now.  

So the first female character I'd like to talk about is a 16 years old, half-elf doctor called Thea who works as a bodyguard for her best friend Ludwig. She's his bodyguard because he's the crown prince and while he isn't old enough to rule he wants to travel through his realm in secret to get to know his people. Even though she's 1 year younger than him she's calmer, more collected and more rational than him and is the voice of caution and reason in their relationship but she's extremely protective of him because he is the only person left that she loves (her mother was killed in the same night the emperor was killed), she never knew her father and never really had an extended family.   


The second would be a human mage called Carlatta. She's the director of the academy of mages that specializes in enchantment magic. First, I accidentally wrote her as the love interest of a male protagonist that dies so that he has a motivation but then I fell in love with her as a character and it dawned on me that this was just another ""Stuffed in the Fridge"" so I made her a main protagonist. She's a faux femme fatale that is a seductress that tries to seduce her former lover. Or so the reader is told. In reality, she's just a successful women coming from a patriarchal culture where people are intimitated by her success and spread rumors about her enchanting and seducing her way to power.

Choice,"In regards to abortion and men opting out of parenting. What do you guys think. If there is a pregnancy and all necessary protections are taken then do you feel it is right that a man opts out of fatherhood.

I fully back the choice of abortion as it is her body but in regards to the male counterpart, where does he come in? Some suggest that if one of either parents does not once the child then an abortion must happen although this blatantly disregards the mother‚Äôs choice.

Currently in place is the paperback so that a father can not need to act as one with no strings attached although this means none of the benefits.

How is sex positivity compatible with feminist criticism?,"Every single sex community (and I do mean every single one) I have been around has made me feel absolutely disgusted with its rampant misogyny, entitlement and androcentrism. Clitorises still being neglected, ideas about the ""sexual market"", about lonely men being victimised by women and their high standards, about (men's) porn and fetishes being key to female sexual liberation, male lack of consideration for their female sexual partners being seen as ""just men being men"" and ""some women being into that"", calling women prudes (oh how often I have seen women having to put massive disclaimers about how kinky and adventurous they are any time they have the gall to refuse an unpleasant and/or degrading sex act or, heaven forbid, complain about how normalised and expected it is), complete blindness to the sexual inequalities that women deal with, on top of ignorance in regards to misogyny in general, assumptions of it being normal for male interests to include wanting to subjugate women and do things to them that are widely seen as unpleasant and degrading, which is frequently subtly talked about as ""male sexuality"" that our misandrist puritanical world (and cough,cough *certain groups*) is on a crusade against, maledom being a presumed norm and that pandering to men, performing femininity and fitting female beauty standards is sexually liberating because female sexuality is emotional and reactive (i.e. passive).

Whenever I have seen (pretty much solely) women try to criticise these assumptions, they would walk on eggshells, apologising all the way, insisting that they're adventurous otherwise, that it's all fine and okay and that they're not questioning anything that anyone is doing, but that they just have a few things that are rubbing them the wrong way. This would then get shut down immediately with notions that it's kink-shaming, sex negative and/or misandrist against ""male sexuality"". And they're right. **If your argument is that any expression of sexuality is fine as long as it's consensual\*, how can you possibly talk about the inequality, neglect, unfair treatment, degradation, ignorance, damaging norms and objectification that women are put through in sex**, which only gets worse the more extreme the content gets (but is present even in ""vanilla"" sex)? **How is the insistence that sexual interests have no bearing on reality possibly compatible with acknowledging the very real damage these sexual interests do to women** both in how they're perceived in and outside sexual contexts, **and the existence of patriarchal pressures**? I would ask how these two value systems can coexist, but they don't seem to: women who point out the elephant in the room are discredited instantly by (usually) men who are always far more invested in normalising the patriarchal sexual norms that revolve around their needs and desires (with huge industries pandering almost exclusively to these ideas), than in women gaining equal treatment. How often have you seen men raise their voices in unison in defence of women who are hurt by these misogynistic ideas, vs in defence of misogynistic porn, kinks and fantasies, insisting on how harmless they are and how they're just simple ""fun"" (why ""fun"" for men is synonymous with misogyny is something you are not supposed to question) even to women talking about how badly it has affected their relationships and self-esteem as human beings? Moreover, doing extensive work on yourself in order to undo even an inkling of misogynistic ideas is not seen as a pre-requisite for engaging in supposedly completely unrelated-to-reality misogynistic sex and fantasies and doesn't even enter the picture in any sex community that I know of.

I realised this ties into my complaints of liberalism in general: treating misogyny as harmless fun, a manifestation of an infinite variety of human personalities (why these misogynistic personalities just so happen to skew heavily male is seen as a funny curiosity) and, the most popular, as offensive to women and their independence for implying that they'd be offended, affected and harmed by it. This is a common male strategy used to shut down feminist attempts to address and fix these issues. The idea is that we are somehow, contrary to all evidence, living in a society where everyone independently makes their own life decisions and ideas unaffected by centuries of patriarchal pressures still going strong, so by criticising these views, you are criticising an integral part of their identity and free will, and women's choice and preference towards misogynistic unfair treatment. **If you think it is possible for feminists to function in these environments without having to engage in copious amounts of doublethink or keep their heads down, please try to explain how, because I am truly curious.** The only thing I have seen on this subject is denial that these things happen and, if they do, denial that they are a problem.

\---------

\*I personally don't see how misogyny is rendered acceptable just by the act of masturbating to it, or women consenting to it much like they have for centuries. Accepting patriarchal gender norms is not daring, progressive or new in any way and never has been. I have never seen these fabled men whose misogyny is solely and exclusively limited to masturbating despite repeated claims from men that *everyone* knows the difference between reality and fiction (which is also not in line with the experiences of a hefty chunk of women). I am also at a loss of why we're acting like misogyny is some inconceivable crazy part of someone's unique imagination that by some sheer coincidence happens to manifest en masse in the same ways throughout centuries, rather than very obviously directly based in widespread ideas about men and women and their values.",1

Men afraid of women at work,"There is evidence of a growing number of men, who avoid women in the workplace, avoid being one on one, avoid mentoring women. This hurts women.¬†


https://nypost.com/2019/05/17/men-are-afraid-to-mentor-women-after-metoo-and-it-hurts-us-all-study/


I read a number of articles on that topic. Another example:


https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2019/02/18/in-the-era-of-metoo-are-men-scared-of-mentoring-women/


There is a common pattern. Authors ignore and dismiss concerns of men, they give their own explanations of the experiences, feelings and motives of these men, in condescending and scolding manner and shift the topic to empowering women, defeating bias against women and improving career opportunities for women. So basically men should shut up, stop whining and do their best to help women advance.¬†I'd say, it is basically womansplaining. 


I know, that feminism is about women's issues, not about troubles of men. That's fair enough, I totally accept this approach. So let's assume these papers are supposed to fix the problem for women, defeat the backlash against metoo. However, let's see what kind of message does it deliver to these men, who are afraid of women at the workplace?¬†


Men aren't listened to. Their concerns and point of view are ignored. Men aren't entitled to be treated with dignity and feeling of security. Men are an instrument for the advance of¬† women...¬†


So if a man is afraid of women, he receives a message that his fears are completely valid.

Is my frustration with white activists bigoted?,"Hi, I'm a BIPOC Non-binary feminist who is very active on feminist, social justice and lgbt+ spaces, usually lurking and listening.

Over this year especially, I've grown very frustrated with white feminists, lgbt and leftist spaces, usually due to overt euro-centric, white fragility, and subtle racism and ableism. 

The thing is, my frustration is usually aimed at women/femmes, and I'm not sure if I'm getting misogynistic. 

I guess my reasoning for targeting women/femmes is because I have a higher expectation for women/femmes. 

I kinda already have a low expectation for cis men, because I see men display bigotry more then women, *(apologises for the generalisation)* so I get angry when I see women display bigotry.

Why is there so little medical support for women during their periods?,"I was thinking recently about an experience I had when I was a teenage girl. I went to my (male) doctor because I had passed out during my period. I was in the shower and a bunch of black spots crept into my vision and then I fully blacked out. It was only for a little bit, but still.

I told my doctor about the incident, and he first asked me if I was anorexic. I said no. Then he essentially gave no advice, and said that this was ""normal"" for teenage girls.

I look back and I just can't help but think that the lack of support for women during their periods is an issue of systemic sexism. Even if it *is* normal, is it not unhealthy to be passing out because of blood loss? Should there not be some kind of procedure? The only option is usually birth control (though he didn't recommend that to me) which generally has a ton of side effects.

It just feels so dismissive and like nobody has put in the effort to research because the issue is women-specific. ",1

"Nurture, nature and culture ‚Äî all the same?","1. I was reading a blog recently, that told a story about how Amazon sells sex dolls resembling children. Gross, but they also said how Japanese scientists believe these sex dolls actually might help children since they keep predators from preying on actual children. Here is the [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/01/can-child-dolls-keep-pedophiles-from-offending/423324/) I found.  
German scientists, on the other hand, believe it has the opposite effects, and may actually encourage pedophiles to move to children from dolls. Here is [an article](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-government-signs-off-on-tougher-child-sex-abuse-rules/a-55347906) that mentions that they passed a law to crack down on dolls resembling children.   
People in the comments were arguing who is right, but I was thinking ‚Äî¬†can they both be right (or wrong)? I mean, Japanese and German culture as so extremely different, that can we really have universal conclusions about such complex parts of human behavior? In fact, can we really take seriously any research about any gender differences for example, when it cannot be divorced from the culture? 
2. Epigenetic inheritance. Several years ago I read about new studies about [trauma passed down to generations](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190326-what-is-epigenetics). Basically, traits a person acquired during their life can be passed down to offsprings. This is a very complicated and not very well researched topic, but some evidence does in fact suggest there is such thing. You can read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenerational_epigenetic_inheritance) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism). 

Ok finally to my question. There are a lot of questions here about nature and nurture (most are in bad faith). A lot of misogynistic figures like Jordan Peterson use these studies that supposedly show how gender differences are genetic. I mean, there are a lot of studies that prove the ""nature"" but there are also a lot of studies that prove ""nurture"", and the more I read about it, the more it resembles the wave-particle duality. But it can't be both?

Or can it? 

If nature IS nurture due to epigenetic inheritance, won't it be the final solution to all these arguments? In simple terms, we no longer might need to argue that ""no, women aren't biologically inclined to accept lower salaries"" but we can link it to generation of oppression and culture of patriarchy that indeed makes women more agreeable. It's nature ‚Äî because it's in DNA, but it's also nurture ‚Äî because it came as a result of patriarchy. 

Scientists have already proven that people's brains are plastic. British taxi drivers have different brain chemistry because they needed to memorize hundreds of streets. So why cannot human genetic be plastic? 

And back to my first point, we cannot deny that nations and ethnicities have different behavior patterns. I know this argument is often used by racists, and believe me it's honestly not my intention. Racists talk about ""genetically"" ~~worse~~ different ethnicities, while scientists argue that it's due to culture and euro-centric standards. But maybe they are indeed different, maybe culture is genetics, and both are constantly changing. Maybe Japanese pedophiles are in fact inclined to hurt children less if exposed to sex dolls, and German pedophiles are the opposite?",1

I had a question about the nature aspect of this argument. Besides just hormones do genes play a role in this?

With all of that said, and all that she has actually accomplished at only 48, my initial reaction was that despite her maybe controversial political alignment, I thought feminists and republican women might come together to see her as a feminist icon as she is a woman who seems to truly have it all and has broken the glass ceiling.

Vasectomy and body autonomy,"Throwaway account, I prefer to keep this question separated from my main account. SorryAlso  for my english, its my second language.

My understanding is that contraception is important part of body autonomy. And women has no obligation to disclose its use, if she would be punished or suffer for  it. She has no obligation to tell about hormonal pills to conservative/religious parents or partner. Women also has no obligation to disclose morning-after pill, failed pregnancies or abortion. At extreme end, women there is no obligation to tell father about new  born baby (if he is abusive etc)... 

My question: how does this body autonomy translates to men and their use  of contraception? Do men have obligation to disclose its use if they would be punished for using it? 

More specifically do I have obligation to disclose my vasectomy in relationship, if we also use condoms as anti-conception? 

In past I was abused and physically attacked for disclosure. It took me a few months to recover. I refuse to go through it again.

the existence of those anti-harassment propaganda makes me wonder:

Does it really makes men harass women less?

Should powerful countries use their influence to make the world more feminist?,"Question in title, but to clarify, here's an example.

Country A has established complete gender equality (I know this seems farfetched) and has a neighboring country B who is behind the times. Country B doesn't give women the right to vote, have abortions, or equal wages. Would feminists support non violent action taken by country A to exert pressure on country B such as an embargos? Also, would they support using force, such as directly engaging in wars or supporting opposition groups within country B? The goal of such actions would be for country B to pass legislation which gives women greater equality.

Just to be clear, this has nothing to do with any real life scenario. I am just curious if feminists agree with this sort of thing. Also, my own opinion is a point (severe human rights abuses, genocide, etc.) where country A would have a moral obligation to act. However, I'm not sure at what exact point that would be as I am against wars in general or interfering in the affairs of other countries.

But I got to thinking, because history is so andocentric, I really don't know anything about those women. The only thing I know about rape in the past is based on  a male perspective. For instance, many historic rape laws only treated rape as a property crime, where it was only considered wrong if the woman ""belonged"" to a man. I would like to see the women's perspectives on rape and assault, especially acts that were not taboo at the time, for instance, marital rape. Are there any writing from women on the subject, preferably predating the 20th century?",1

Why does female leadership *matter*?,"I think of myself as a female leader (in a small scale, big fish/small pond kinda way). And I've always thought, ""the world would OBVIOUSLY be better with more women in charge."" I just sort of saw a more co-operative, human-based, empathetic world where things actually WORK and people work together. You know. In my INFP daydream head. 

Someone scoffed at this sentiment recently, saying ""Women will screw it up too. Power corrupts. People in power are always awful."" 

And this is an argument I want to counter. 

From my research, it would seem companies with more women in C-suite roles show a profit advantage, as well as better working conditions. So, it's better for the economy. But then I know the retort will be, so what? The economy drives wealth division. 

Well, since 5% of all CEOs of Fortune 500s are female and that's PATHETIC, encouraging female leadership will bring about equality. Which I see as a good thing. But why? Why does it MATTER? How do you make someone care? 

I read today that women graduate from college with expectations of promotions and raises that are DASHED by real life working conditions. Meanwhile, men have the same expectations throughout. And are promoted and raised much higher. Um, depressing. 

It's not fair. And really, that's the best reason I can come up with. But when is life ever fair? 

I want to be able to explain why having more female leadership matters. All I can really think of, though, is...New Zealand seems like it's doing awesome! (I said this. The counterpoint was that it's 4 million people. Drat. Can't argue.) Thoughts?",1

Why support affirmative action but not benevolent sexism?,"This is more of a word play but I find it weird we pretty much realized affirmative action is good in that it gives level playing field in schools and education or jobs- so why not the same for benevolent sexism- where it gives *social* level field to women?

How are men supposed to show their feelings according to feminism?,"It seems like feminism has a certain exact way they want men to be able to show their feelings and talk about them and their issues, so what is this way?

How can white/wealthy feminists help create a movement that is more open to WOC and lower class women?,"It is no secret that the history of feminism is not pretty. It has notoriously been exclusionary and/or dismissive towards women of color and lower class women. Angela Davis' *Women, Race, and Class* is an excellent analysis of this. The popular term ""white feminism"" shows that this is still an issue today, despite pushes for intersectionality. [This article](https://chacruna.net/how-white-feminists-oppress-black-women-when-feminism-functions-as-white-supremacy/), although I do not agree with all of it, provides a very solid critique of feminism's failure to stand up for women of color. Thankfully, I have seen an improvement in some of these areas (particularly from young people and online activism) but I do agree that there is less discourse about these issues in many feminist spaces.

With the Black Lives Matter movement highlighting racial inequality in the world, I think that we, as feminists, also have a duty to analyze how the feminist movement has perpetuated racism and white supremacy both in the past and present. How can we address our historical problems and how can we make feminism more intersectional?",1
"Why did so much of the world, from societies that were connected to disconnected all because patriarchal rather than matriarchal or 50/50 split?","From earliest days of human civilization, patriarchal rules were the default from as far ago as we know. But given that we definitely know matriarchal rule exist in many animal kingdoms and indeed even in some human society- it weird that we didn‚Äôt split up in a converging 50/50 social and economical model of 2 forms of rulers. 

What do you think was the catalyst or reason for this drastic difference between the 2 forms of gender rule? Why were women so ineffective or uninterested in ruling societies?",1
What is Feminism's current modern stance according to Feminists? Thoughts on the movement feeling insular and ways to combat this?,"I think a lot of people say Feminism is for equal rights for all genders but why isn't it called Equalism then?

The reason for this is that this undermines the movement. 

For example, this is similar to saying BLM, why not All Live Matter. The fact that this group came about was because said group are being treated wrongfully and unfairly. The structures in place that encourages the injustices seen today. The name for the group highlights this. I would say the BLM movement is very similar to the Feminism movement in that aspect.

I tried to look around for a general ""What is Feminism"" in the subreddit, but did not find one. 

From my understanding, Feminism focuses on the equality of women's rights in tandem with men's rights. 

However, similar to groups such as BLM, it feels difficult to join the movement if an individual is not under the issues felt by the members of the movement. Sadly it feels as groups such as these, perhaps not by intention feel quite insular. At least through my perspective as a male. 

Thoughts on this?",1
What are your views about religious arguments against Feminism?,"Let me preface this by saying that personally I believe freedom of religion is non negotiable, religion and faith are personal things and should be kept as such.

I've often come across religious people making casual statements like ""a wife's duty is to follow her husband"", ""if my husband allows I might"", ""there are things that only men can do"", etc etc. Most of these things are backed up by their own religious beliefs, while I am not religious, I respect that faith plays a strong role in people's lives, however it's so hard for me to grasp how such views sit well with the people who have them? How can you even explain Feminist struggles to someone who inherently believes that there is a designated ""place"" for men and women in life and society?",1
"What does it mean to be an ""ally"" when it comes to feminism?","Traditionally, I understand the word ""ally"" to mean ""one who advocates for a marginalized group while not belonging to it."" However, in the context of feminism, this seems redundant, since men can and do identify as ""feminist"" (I mean, obviously not enough of them, but you know what I mean).

Does the word ""ally"" mean something different in this context? Charitably, I could see it being used to imply that you don't want to speak over women; uncharitably, I could see it being used to shrug off the responsibility of actually advocating for feminism. Is there any consistency to how the term is used when it comes to women's rights?",1

Why do analyses of the gender wage gap never control for height?,"The research seems pretty conclusive that height significantly impacts earnings.

"Is anyone aware of any research that looks at things like the pay gap, domestic violence, sexual violence etc while controlling for gender expression and not just gender?","Hey everyone,

I don‚Äôt know if this is a stupid question so feel free to tell me if I‚Äôm completely of base with this. 
So I was wondering if anyone was aware of any research that looked at inequality in relation gender expression. 

Just  to give an example, I am aware of the gender pay gap . However, research on the gender pay gap within LGBTQ+ populations is more complicated. For example, the pay gap between gay men and lesbians is much lower in many places , with several  studies showing gay men earning  *less than* straight men and lesbians earning *more than* straight women. Overall, though these studies show a smaller  gap, they still  show that gay men earn more. However, I fee that this may become more complicated if controlling for gender expression. 
For example, some studies on gay men have shown that single gay men earn significant more than coupled gay men,  concluding that being visibly gay severely diminishes earning potential in some places. There are also some studies showing that  gay men read as masculine are much more economically successful. As such, I‚Äôm wondering if a lot of the privilege in this area is tied to gender expression. While I haven‚Äôt been able to find anything, I‚Äôd be curious to know whether gay men read as feminine earn more than say lesbians read as masculine.

Another example is domestic violence. While LGBTQ research is very limited in this area, there does seem to be some evidence that such violence is more common in lesbian relationships. While this has been questioned on the basis of lesbians perhaps being more likely to report such violence, I can‚Äôt help but wonder whether gender expression may come into play, with feminine presenting  gay men perhaps being less violent  than masculine lesbians. 


Anyway, it‚Äôs a long shot but if anyone is aware of anything that explores this stuff in relation to gender expression rather than sexed bodies, I‚Äôd love to hear about it. Perhaps there is some stuff that has been written about women embodying toxic masculinity?


Edit: I was a bit reluctant to question domestic violence but i did so because of some lesbian terfs that I have encountered reducing such violence to to an issue with people AMAB. I feel that any evidence of the issue being tied to embodiments of toxic masculinity could be useful for deconstructing such assumptions",1
The non-inclusion of male rape victims in the Indian Penal Code,"Looking for some Indian feminists here! Of course, others are also welcome.

The Indian Penal Code, Section 375, defines rape as: "" Rape.‚ÄîA man is said to commit ‚Äúrape‚Äù who, except in the case hereinafter excepted, has sexual intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under any of the six following de¬≠scriptions: "" followed by descriptions of consent, consent under duress etc.

This clearly means there is no legislation for a man to file a rape complaint if he's been raped (either by men or women). A glaring inequality, obviously.

My question is, are there any feminists fighting for this? I genuinely have not seen any feminist organizations raising their voice to fix this. I started a petition which is still very nascent. I also saw men's rights organizations trying to bring light to this, but were vilified by media outlets such as Vice ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKSqmwDzFxA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKSqmwDzFxA)).

I'm not trying to taunt anyone; if I see any proof of feminists fighting for this, I'd be delighted beyond words to know that the fight does not have to be divided between feminists and non-feminists.

Progressive cultures and everyday sexism,"Hey I aim this question towards those mostly who had the opportunity to visit many different countries:  


When it comes to ""casual sexism"" (such as not listening to women, objectification, commenting on appearances, or shaming unfeminine behavior), do you noticed any substantial difference in men between different countries? How does that relate to how liberal or progressive that countries is considered?   


My question comes from a conversation with one of my girlfriends who after living in the US spent 1 year in the EU. She said that man were MUCH MORE sexist in the western countries, that are considered much more progressive then the USA. (France and Germany to be exact.) So much so, that she couldnt even wear a skirt, because of the staring and comments on the street. Then she spent more time in other parts in the EU more to the east (i cant really remember which countries, but small ones), that are considered very traditionalist countries. There men were much more reserved didnt harass her, but also kind of just looked trough her, like she wasnt even there.  
Im deeply surprised by this, as I always thought of western EU to be much more equal and respectful when it comes to women. Had anyone else had similar experiences?",1
Are people who own art created by problematic creators obligated to get rid of that art or add some notice when that art is presented?,"I was thinking specifically about art that I own from a game called Magic the Gathering (MtG) but I'll start with a specific example of a more well known artist first.

TW: sexual abuse

\-- Specific question with a more well known artist --

If you own music by R. Kelly should you stop listening to it or whenever you hear/play it, do something to acknowledge his history of sexual abuse? Especially if you already own the art, what is the 'correct' thing to do? Does it matter that while a particular song can't be replaced, you can just listen to other music? What if you do like a particular R. Kelly song? Should you find a way to get it without potentially benefiting him, or just not seek out his art?

\-- Specific to me version --

MtG is a trading card game where players battle with decks of cards they choose out of their collection. An essential part of every deck is the 'lands' which are a key part of gameplay. Each land has art on it, and at this point, there are hundreds of different versions for the 5 most common lands. Lands can be acquired by purchasing individual cards from a store, but are most frequently acquired by opening randomized packs of cards.

One of the more prolific artists for MtG, Noah Bradley, admitted on twitter (and then deleted) to sexually abusive behavior. Some cards only have one version for which he is the artist. For other cards, like lands, he is one artist of many. 

Before Bradley's admission, I would frequently seek out lands with his art because, in my opinion, they look really good, but I've already decided that I won't do that anymore.

Now what should I do with these lands featuring Bradley's art? Should I keep them and play with them while acknowledging (either to just to myself or aloud to my opponent as well) that he's a terrible person? Should I throw them away or trade or sell them away? Or something else that I haven't thought of?

confusion with misogyny and body positivity in art,"Hi Ask Feminist, 

I'm an artist, and I have a question regarding art, misogyny, and body positivity. 

I apologize for any mistakes in the post because of my writing skills

here is the background i'm from a third world country, I grew up in a woman-dominated society, I grew up knowing that respecting woman is by having good manners as individual and help to create an equal rights system which is, in reality, is not only, I became an activist, unfortunately, I was drawing what I have seen in the book, magazines pictures of models, etc without any understood of misogyny, thinking its form of appreciation to draw women in this manner. when I moved out of my country for college, I tried to fit with men western society, which was a big mistake as a young individual because it Terribly influenced my art and thanks to my girlfriend who showed me the level of inequality, sexism in the western country which is unfortunate. as the rest of the world.

I have bought the sketchbook of an artist called Frank Frazetta, to use as a reference, the book showed beautiful drawings of women and men of all ages and sizes in a beautiful realistic sketch which is good to me, since I'm trying to make a video about art and body positivity, and how SJW failed to help society learn to understand desexualizing bodies in a very awful way, I have decided to get another book by the same artist and the book called  Sensuous Frazetta and I was in doubt if the art and pictures of sketches are sexist and misogynistic from a feminist critique, 

I highly appreciate art,  I'm a different person now and  I don't want to be toxic, sexist, or a bad influence on my audience, nor my children in the future.",1
What does femininity means to you?,"Edit: by femininity in the title I meant the word ""womanhood""

I guess this is not quite the usual question you might see on here, but I'll carry on and if this isn't aligned with this sub's rules I'll delete it.

I'm a pre transitioned, mostly closeted trans woman (or girl, I'm barely 17 even lol) I'm out to my close friends, and *some* of them have even started referring to me by female pronouns, but I'm conflicted.

I find it hard to believe the fact that even though they've known me for months as male, now just after telling them ""hey I've been questioning for a long while and I think I'm a girl"" that they suddenly full heartedly see me as a girl, most of my friends are cis girls (aside from one trans man) (or boy???) And it's hard for me to understand how someone who was born a girl, has been a girl all of her life, and has such a grasp of their femininity and womanhood suddenly considering me (a 6'1 dude with the body, voice and socialisation of a man) ""one of their own""? I feel like they see me as someone who does larp and they just say I'm a real girl in a dishonest way, either to avoid hurting their own self perception of how accepting/woke they are, or to avoid hurting my feelings and popping my bubble.

I don't know why, but I think I view femininity as this sacred status, something like Judaism were the circumstances have to be specific. You can say you're Jewish, you can read the tanach even in Hebrew and do mitzvot and even wear their clothings, but if you were born a goy, you are simply not Jewish. And because I didn't get to experience life as a girl, I can't be a girl, and I can't actually relate to my cis female friends until after I pass (which won't be for a while because my mom isn't exactly keen on accepting me), I feel like a fake, like a ridiculous larper that is making everyone in the room and outside it uncomfortable and full of pity towards me.",1

Should a Women ask for consent for a warmup,"Inspired by a CMV post I read early I have a question about consent.

Consider the following scenario: After 3 dates the woman invites the man into her place. Sexual and emotional attraction is there and they hit if of with it hot make out session. The woman stops the man from going any further (as is her right and totally OK). But the man is frustrated.

The woman only wanted the make out session and did not want sex. She got everything she wanted out of the date. The man thought the make out session was foreplay and would not have consented to it if he know that it was nothing else.

The woman sexually exploited the man for her needs. Should the woman not address that she does not want sex now but would be down for some action?

Edit: There seem to be some confusion, that I may imply that the woman owns sex. This is wrong. My scenario is specifically for the situations in which the woman knows that she does not want sex and if she should tell him beforehand.",1
The Struggle,"I believe women should be given an equal place in society to the pedestal men have been placed on. But it's hard not to feel down when I see things that seem to make women somehow intrinsically better than men. Like science itself is showing them to be better in pretty much every way. A few examples include how each of women's senses outperform those of men, women play a much larger role in reproduction, women tend to outperform men in all sorts of academic measures, women generally live longer than men, there are far fewer women who do crimes (that we can see anyway), the female body repairs itself better by having a second X chromosome, women have more beautiful voices (okay, this is more my personal experience of how people seem to enjoy music with singing more when a woman's voice is involved, but I don't often see much evidence to the contrary), women tend to be the preferred subject for every kind of visual art (statues, paintings, etcetera, but this applies more to modern day), and how nearly every person people are scared of is a man, not a woman. I could go further, but I'll stop there, for now at least. Whenever a guy says anything like this, at best he gets answers that are like a pat on the back, expressing a rhetoric that they like men and that's why they want them to stay around, but this isn't helpful. How in the world is it possible for me to feel equal to a woman knowing no matter what I do, she's better? It's not. When so many basic things seem to be in favor of women, maleness sometimes almost feels like some sort of genetic defect (this might be a bit extreme). The only end to this struggle is solid evidence. Can you find any evidence that disputes these ideas? Sorry this was so long, maybe just try a couple of them and see what you find.",1

What's your take on alimony when both partners are earning well?,"Alimony was originally introduced to compensate the non-working spouse as they sacrificed their career to raise their kids. But if both parties have a job, why should the higher-earning party pay alimony? It just doesn't make sense. It's not like the lower-earning spouse sacrificed their career for their family. They have a full-time job. For instance, it makes no sense for a guy earning $150k to pay alimony to his ex-wife who earns 100k in a full-time job. I'm quoting these numbers because a friend of mine, who earned $150k had to pay his ex-wife alimony, even though she didn't sacrifice her career for the family.

For example, if we‚Äôre playing video games, and there‚Äôs a girl on the other team, her goal is to instantly assert herself as ‚Äúthe better gamer girl‚Äù and find irrational (and sometimes sexist) ways to talk down the other female, sometimes even slut shaming cause that girl allegedly ‚Äúsounded like a w***e.‚Äù 

Myself, and even her boyfriend try to explain that what she‚Äôs doing isn‚Äôt nice at all, and she gets mad at us for taking a stranger‚Äôs side. It‚Äôs one thing for usual gamer banter and trash talk, but she‚Äôs genuinely ruined people‚Äôs days, because she preemtively assumes that that girl is ‚Äúa b***h‚Äù and bullies them. Some girls will fight back, and some will be sad, but regardless, she aggravated them in the first place and they could‚Äôve been completely chill before she came along.

At the end of it all, SHE gets stressed and claims that these girls online were mean or even misogynistic... TOWARDS HER... and that by defending themselves they were being a**holes.‚Äù If we call her out she says we don‚Äôt understand ‚Äúbecause we‚Äôre guys.‚Äù

My 2 questions are, is there a reason for girls who adopt this attitude? None of her friends, nor even her significant other support the values she upholds, so I can‚Äôt imagine the source of her influence. Secondly, is there a correct or proper way I can go about confronting her on this before she hurts more people?",1

Just confused at why am i even a feminist anymore. How is exactly feminism about equality? Need help from fellow feminists,"This post is NOT in anyway to degrade feminism. I consider myself a feminist(although i am not even sure now what it means with all these different definitions out there). **I JUST WANT TO RE AFFIRM WHY AM I A FEMINIST.** As far as i have heard , its about equality. But wherever i search the definition it, it means it is about the equality FOR WOMEN. We already have equal rights infact we have more rights than men.   
I want to believe in the movement but i just dont get it. Maybe i am missing something but every time i try to explain how women are oppressed i just feel ... stupid? I don't feel the force behind my words.

Most deaths are of men, most suicides are of men, most hard jobs in the world are done by men, and men already receive much less help than us women in most cases. Albeit its mostly men doing it to each other but does that also not mean that we are privilaged and not the primary victims? 

Men might be doing it to each other but that only means they are the real victims and not us. They are in much more pain than us. They need more help not us. We already have the rights we need in America. We have infact MORE rights than men. 

I think that feminism works on patriarchy to dismantle it but how do we know that whatever will replace it will be better? Women leaders have been known to start more wars then men in past. I mean we are not saints either compared to men.

Also isnt patriarchy sort of justified? It has been men who have done most(not all) of the things in society. They are the ones who mostly built it. They are the ones who do most of the hard jobs. Isnt patriarchy justified in a sense? Why are we dismantling it instead of fixing it?

I feel like men need far more help than women in current times. They are the ones who are much more fucked up. How am i wrong? Please help me. Please help me realize what am i even fighting for.

I found the following definitions for feminism and they do not seem to be about equality...

&gt;**Quite simply, feminism is about all genders having equal rights and opportunities.**  
&gt;  
&gt;It‚Äôs about respecting diverse women‚Äôs experiences, identities, knowledge and strengths, and striving to empower all women to realise their full rights.  
&gt;  
&gt;It‚Äôs about levelling the playing field between genders, and ensuring that diverse women and girls have the same opportunities in life available to boys and men.

"Are there any resources (books, interviews, lectures, etc) that analyze hentai and western animated pornography from a radical feminist perspective?","There‚Äôs plenty to be found about live action pornography, but I‚Äôm trying to find resources for animated pornography. I‚Äôm looking for ethical, moral, feminist, sociological etc analysis of it. 

Recently I‚Äôve been wondering if all pornography in modern form is exploitative and objectifying as well as where and when erotica or artistic nudity crosses the line into pornography. My gut assumption is that it happens when the viewer becomes aroused and acts on arousal through masturbation. 

I‚Äôve been wondering if all pornography in society right now where the industry is so perverse and unrestricted is objectifying and harmful to women. Many women, myself included, can have periods in life where we feel that when a partner watches porn, even if animated, that it can be hurtful and harmful to the relationship. Not all women of course, but it‚Äôs common to see. It‚Äôs harder as we age as well while men our age continue the cookie cutter young girl porn. Or use it because it feels better when they come. Or when we aren‚Äôt in the mood and they want variety. 

We get many arguments about why porn in various forms is okay and why men are justified in using it. It‚Äôs hard to find arguments from the other side, especially for non-live action media. I‚Äôm kinda grappling with how I feel about it and trying to analyze the situation as a whole in comparison to my internal reaction to it. 

Personally, I just feel hopeless sometimes as a h√©tero woman that we have to deal with so many men who have been watching porn daily since they were 13 and get defensive of any critique of it. Growing numbers have porn induced erectile function or escalation into damaging content and sometimes content that borders on illegal, especially where animated is concerned. 

We get the ‚Äútestosterone-Rex‚Äù argument that men are visual and thats why they need it, even though men who have left porn behind speak out against this excuse. Even some biology and medical research is trying to crush this assumption that men are just visual and women are imaginative. So many men and women now conflate masturbation with pornography even though the *can* be mutually exclusive. People say they aren‚Äôt dependent on it and use it in moderation yet they can‚Äôt masturbate and orgasm without any pornographic reinforcement. 

The high speed internet pornography today feels very damaging in various areas (mental, societal, legal, relationships, etc). I just want help analyzing it from a feminist perspective and trying to put into words how I might be feeling, whether it‚Äôs justified or I‚Äôm being irrational. I‚Äôm pretty much set on the harms of live action porn and those industries today. What I‚Äôm undecided about is animated pornography, especially hentai since it‚Äôs a popular form today. Anyone have recommendations or experience with this?",1

I thought upon it and she‚Äôs right, or at least in my mind she‚Äôs right, should I proceed insisting on paying the majority, but not all of it or should I split it equally with her? I‚Äôm sort of at ends with the problem, any advice on how to avoid this kind of subliminal inequality in the future or just if I was being a bad human being would be helpful?",1
Going through boyfriends phone and browsing history for self protection - is that a thing?,"Hi,

Dude here. I recently was part of a conversation that steered to the topic of privacy vs. security, and the necessary tradeoffs between those two.

One of the women, who I know as probably being pretty far on the political left, mention she goes through the phone and browser history of her (relatively new) boyfriend. Some of the women present admitted to doing the same, some didnt. I quickly criticized her for basically disregarding her partners privacy, which is where things took a (for me) unexpected turn: She and two of the other women who agreed said this is a matter of protecting themselves. I ll try to summarize their points briefly:

1.) Phone to know if he is taking nonconsensual images or secretly dating/seeing other women, or might even be involved in something like selling drugs or crime

2.) phone to know if he has problematic connections or contacts, like those infamous WhatsApp groups with racist or far right content that sometimes get mentioned in the press.

3.) browser history to know his porn habits, to know if he is into problematic and potentially dangerous stuff or has fetishes

4.) browser history to know whether he is being radicalized by various MRA movements, secretly part of the incel sphere or otherwise being influenced. This latter point was also something one person claimed would basically have to be monitored continuosly. She cited her sisters experience with such a case, where her husband of 3 years went down the rabbit hole of the Jordan Petersen craze, and it became a major problem.

Now, I ll admit my first reaction was to think these women are just trying to rationalize their jealousy and controlling behaviour, or are obsessed (maybe from past experiences) with sniffing out secrets. But given that these women are all mid 20s to late 30s, college educated and generally not, to my knowledge, lacking in life experience, thats probably not the right conclusion. Are these reasons, from a feminist perspective, a valid justification for this breach of privacy?",1
Why does feminism reject the MRA movement,"My question is why Feminism does not accept and why it does not accept the MRA movement.

How do you feel about being asked to represent the feminist perspective in everyday life?,"I had a situation recently where I was asked to participate in a discussion on a specific subject that I have a lot of knowledge about. This was on Zoom. There were three men, and me, the one woman. The topic itself is not directly about women's issues or feminism, but we got to talking about a person who is well-respected in the industry but also highly problematic and who has many allegations of sexual assault against him.

I had some things to say about that, as did the other participants. It was a good discussion and no one said anything out of place or anti-feminist. But one guy on the call kept privately messaging me in the zoom chat and telling me I should be pushing back more and that ""we really need to hear the feminist perspective about this"". I'd say I was talking a decent amount, and that he was the only one talking more than me. He sent several messages sort of checking in on me and telling me that I should feel free to speak up more. At the end of the call he said I shouldn't apologize for talking over someone. There were a few instances during the call where I talked at the same time as someone and said ""Oh, sorry..."" or something along those lines.

I think he meant well and I don't want to split hairs about men trying to be good feminists or good allies, but it bothered me. It actually made me more self conscious and singled out. Like as the only woman I was the ultimate authority on the feminist perspective. What do you all think about this?",1
Is lesbianism related to patriarchy,"Hello there, 

As an anti-feminist I would like to apologise in advance, if any of the following statements seem tone-deaf or incomprehensible.

Straight man and lesbians are gynophilic, which makes them engage in negative behaviour like: Objectifying women, consuming pornorgraphy, laying with female sex-workers, gazing and sexually harassing women and alike. There is also a high degree of domestic abuse, which can be found in lesbian relationships. 

So, I was wondering: is lesbianism an extension of or in any way related to patriarchy?",1

I'm currently taking a class on psychoanalysis and my professor recommended me *Psychoanalysis and Feminism* by Mitchell but that that was the extent of his knowledge on any connection.

Talking to a TERF as a cis man,"(X-posted from /r/socialjustice101)

A friend of mine recently admitted to me that trans women offend her, e.g. she thinks that they caricature women and ""appropriate"" her gender and experiences with sexism.

While I'm pretty confident that she's wrong to be offended, it didn't feel like it was my place to say that. In most other situations it would be frowned upon for a man to dismiss a woman's concerns when it comes to gender issues, so I felt uncomfortable saying ""no, as a cis man I can tell you that you, a cis woman, are wrong to be offended.""

Am I just being silly?",1

Best Clothing Companies That Donate To Feminist Organizations &amp; NonProfits,"Hello! Just found this forum and haven't yet checked out the typical discussions-- so I hope this question is appropriate for this forum. 

Anyways, my sister-in law's birthday is in early November and wanted to get her and myself a  shirt promoting feminism. I noticed that she, like me, have a lot of political clothing but could use some more feminist or women rights articles of clothing in our wardrobe. ""Feminist Apparel"" was of course the first suggestion in a quick google search; however, from little research I read the CEO Alan Martofel laid of 90% of workers for, ""not supporting his views,"" but multiple sources say this wasn't true, and that it was more because of the workers finding out about immoral capital driven beliefs and history of being a serial sexual abuser of women--subsequently, calling for his resignation, only for him to shortly step down and fire his current staff.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I mentioned, my research is limited and i'm not sure the current state or action of the company, but would just rather avoid it all together. So my question is, what are some alternatives for feminist clothing, that also donate profits to coalition of feminist nonprofits or just fight for the cause in general? A few options would be appreciated, since this is a gift and something I hope we can wear for style and message. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand you can't trust major companies in a capitalism driven industry, but just looking for any advice on morally upstanding, or websites that are truthful in their donations.

"Do you think it's ""playing into the patriarchy"" or otherwise problematic when a woman wants to be physically attractive?","I notice a trend in female-majority communities/subs where whenever a woman talks about being unattractive and says that she wants to be attractive, a very common response is ""wanting to be pretty is just playing into the patriarchy.""

For instance, [here's a thread](https://www.removeddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/i3k30t/how_to_make_peace_with_being_ugly/) from a woman who wants advice on coping with being unattractive, and one of the deleted comments said this:

&gt; Why is beauty women‚Äôs ultimate goal? Why do we try to attain looking like a model while being brilliant, responsible and kind. Men don‚Äôt have that kind of pressure. It‚Äôs bullshit we internalize that.

&gt; You need to realize beauty shouldn‚Äôt be the goal and let go of the chains of patriarchy. Read radical feminist literature. It‚Äôll make you realize wanting to feel beautiful is just a trap made by men so women don‚Äôt focus on their awesomeness and pay too much money and attention to something incredibly superficial.

&gt; Look at how many successful men are ugly as sin. Do you think they really care? No. They‚Äôre too busy working and thinking and making their dreams happen. Channel your inner man who‚Äôs never felt pressure to be pretty.

You can also find related comments [on another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/ia7lor/i_wish_it_were_socially_acceptable_to_admit_that/):

So generally, I see a difference between valuing looks as your only asset, and merely wanting to be more physically attractive. I think this kind of response (above) is just sidelining the issue and suggesting that it's problematic for a woman to desire to be physically attractive. If I were to give advice to unattractive women in such a position (like myself, honestly :/), I wouldn't tell them ""no, you shouldn't want to be pretty, that's the patriarchy controlling you"" but I would rather give them advice on how to improve their appearance where possible. What advice would you give such a woman?

So what do you think of this approach?",1

Please note, I like the term ""chairperson,"" and I rant about the economic value of domestic labor, so I'm not hostile to feminist ideals. I think this question is fairly radical.

Proto-Indo-European had two declensions/genders, animate and inanimate.  Then there developed an explicitly feminine declension/gender, and so  the animate declension adopted masculinity by default. 

Why not keep going? Keep ""man"" meaning ""human"" but come up with a new word for ""man"" meaning ""male human."" Surely someone has made some suggestions, right?

I have a question regarding online advice.,"
Originally posted in r/BlatantMisogyny but i was told to move it here cause it was relevant. That sub is the sub I mean when I say ""this sub"". I literally copied and pasted the text, so this was needed for reference


--------------------------

Hello,


I am a 19M. I have been a long time lurker on this sub (r/BlatantMisogyny) and the shit I see here is frankly shocking. I am also on subs like r/IncelTear and the like. One thing I have noticed over the years is that a lot of young men get drawn into this hateful mix of misogyny, racism, and nowadays the rise of neo-facism largely because they get angry about stuff in their life like being unable to find a date combined with a very strong sense of entitlement. A lot of these guys also had mental health issues when they were younger or whatever. As a young man myself, I've had to deal with people like this and one thing that I always hear when arguing with nut jobs who believe women only like asshole guys or whatever (you know typical PUA, MRA shit), is ""what do you know, you haven't dated much"". Which, is true (I haven't really dated much), but doesn't actually disprove anything I'm saying (like the massive amounts of evidence of online harassment of women, various forms of misogyny in the workplace and such, you all know what I'm talking about since you're presumably on this sub). Regardless, this gets to my question. A lot of young men get sucked into all this hateful stuff online when looking for other young men who haven't dated a lot or just looking for advice. Hell, I've looked for relationship advice online (though I always do so carefully because I know that the internet is full of MRAs and PUAs). Here's the thing, you can pretty easily find PUA stuff online, but I'm not as aware of anti-misogny dating advice sites online (if that makes sense). Now, first a couple disclaimers. I know that there are a lot of guys out there who use feminism as an excuse to meet women and act like a ""nice guy"" and then go full incel when they get rejected. That's not the sorta thing I'm talking about here. Others use it as a way to try and get laid. Frankly, I don't blame a lot of women for being kind of suspicious of men who claim to be feminists, a lot of men have tried to hijack it for their own ends. I don't want to be one of those guys and certainly hope I'm not coming across that way (tho, I'm sure that's a sentence you've heard before too. I get it if you don't believe me, that's fine, I can honestly understand and I won't try and convince you in a reddit post). Anyways, that gets me to the crux of my question:

At one point or another, everyone is going to need relationship advice (no matter the gender, orientation, etc). Where can people find relationship advice online that isn't written by PUAs or MRAs? Like a website that emphasizes enthusiastic consent and not negging women in a bar or whatever. A lot of young men identify with guys like Jordan Peterson or  that Steffen guy who's last name I can't spell and am too lazy to look up. Where can I try and re direct guys I know who are going down that path? Hell, such a site would be useful for me too, I certainly need advice from time to time but I ready don't want to contribute to misogyny and the like. Also, do you agree with my assessment of why a lot of young men get dragged down that rabbit hole?

Again, sorry if this comes across as a guy trying to hijack feminism to meet women or whatever, like I said that's really not my intention though of course I can't and don't expect you to believe me.",1
"Ask Feminists Rules, FAQs, and Resources",,1
Do you have a problem with women who want to be attractive or value her appearance highly?,"(I know the title sounds accusatory/demeaning but trust me that's not the intention)

I notice within feminist circles whenever a woman expresses feeling discontent about her looks &amp; wants to be attractive, she gets told ""pretty is not the rent you pay to exist as a woman"" and I frankly think it's unhelpful. There are also women who put more value into their appearance than their accomplishments etc, or enjoy being complimented on their looks more than their personality and achievements, and these women get told the same thing that they shouldn't value their appearance so highly. That they're just playing into what patriarchy wants, and therefore they should stop doing that.

Like it's true that women need not to value their appearance highly, but does that translate to women *must not* do so? I find that the opposite of liberating women, if that's what the intended message is.

During my late teens I used to find myself unattractive, and I worked very hard on my appearance to become content with my looks years later. And I was so lucky that when I told my peers about my problem, they gave me actual advice on how to improve my appearance rather than ""no, that's what the patriarchy wants, pretty is not the price you pay to exist as a woman, you should be ok being unattractive..."" etc. Like what would i possibly do with this information?

What if it's your female friend or relative or daughter who told you that she wants to be more attractive? Would you tell her ""no, that's what patriarchy wants, so you should not want that"" or would you support her wishes and give her advice on improving her looks?",1

He said that he wishes he could go out every day and get compliments and doors held open for him, and that it‚Äôs a privilege to be able to use one‚Äôs attractiveness or sexuality to get out of things. He said that the pressure on men to be providers and to be stoic and emotionless is more of a burden than the consequences of femininity. I obviously disagree, but I feel like I didn‚Äôt articulate myself well in the moment. How would you respond?",1
What do feminists think of negotiating with the Taliban?,"I ask this question at a trying time in the global context of the war on terror and the war in afghanistan. It is clear that only negotiation and peace process will end the killing and stop the bloodshed from flowing in the fields and on the streets. But whatever happens, the Taliban will remain a force in Afghan politics and will have a big say in how the future country is run. Of course, this war was sold as a war for women, to liberate them from the Taliban and the patriarchal Islamic man. Now, feminists find that their war goals have not been achieved. The Taliban are nowhere near defeat, the US/Afghan governments are no longer capable of defeating them in battle and the Islamic movement is as strong as it ever was. At this point, what do feminists think of negotiating with the Taliban? Because this means that feminists will have no choice but to make compromises and they are not in a position to make any demands. The Taliban hold all the cards in this area and popular support is decidedly against feminism, even among many women. The Afghan government is however willing to make compromises. So are feminists ok with compromising things like sexual freedom, reproductive rights, education etc. in order to stop the bloodshed and end a war that has killed and displaced millions?",1
"Are songs like ""Throat Baby"" misogynistic?","So I wasn't raised ""right"" in any sense of the word, so we'll get that out of the way.

My first exposure to feminism came from reading blogs like Jezebel and XO Jane in the early 2010s. And I've always been confused about hip hop and misogyny. To me it seems like stuff like country music or rock and roll could take a lot of crap for misogyny, but then I'd hear some sexually explicit lyrics that don't actually treat women that well in hip hop and it just never seemed to get the mainstream hate that other genres did. But I'll grant that it's entirely possible that just because I listen to so much more hip hop, and the only times I've ever read about country or rock and roll were when they were in the media, that maybe I just didn't get the full picture. I know that people have gone off to hip hop for misogyny, but I don't know it just doesn't seem like it's that frequent of topic.

So the ""Throat Baby"" comes out, and we'll here are the lyrics:

https://genius.com/Brs-kash-throat-baby-go-baby-lyrics

And I don't know what to think about this. On one hand a lot of people just look at a song like this and think it's a sexually charged song and that makes it okay because talking about sex is okay. I can see the argument that this is just like WAP was where they're just celebrating sexuality, in particular a good blowjob. On the other hand, this just feels like a song that doesn't treat women well? I mean the opening lyrics are calling a woman a bitch and a hoe, and it's an ode her ability to perform sexually for him. 

And I don't know if I'm reading this right. I don't know what really to make of these lyrics. 

So is the song misogynistic?",1

"Do you believe that conventionally attractive women, on the sole basis of being attractive, are discriminated against for being attractive?","So I know that pretty privilege is a thing in many areas. I think this is especially because men may be kinder to them in specific situations, they aren‚Äôt expected to commit crimes, get better treatment when out shopping, and that sort of thing.

But something I also hear is that ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù is often used too often, as a way to discredit attractive people when they come forward about being harassed, sexually or not, and that people have less empathy for them.

Part of this could be a hyper awareness of the ‚Äúhalo effect,‚Äù in which intensifies the jealousy or idea that pretty women don‚Äôt have any real problems.

Personally I think that women that are conventionally very attractive face a double edged sword where they receive privilege they don‚Äôt necessarily want, but people tend to underestimate them in other areas of their lives based on the idea that women can‚Äôt be multi dimensional. 

They also may receive more unwanted sexual attention, and have that dismissed when they come forward, say at work or school, because it should be expected because they are so attractive.

I don‚Äôt know how to word this better so I‚Äôm hoping that somebody will chime that has more complete ideas on this topic",1
"Going out of your way to ""avoid being assaulted""","As a young woman who has mostly lived in small towns, I (fortunately) have very little experience with catcalling, harrassment and other creepy, dangerous behaviours that women can come across when in the public space. However I know that it is unfortunately very much an issue and that in many countries (including mine), women have to constantly think twice before going out alone after dark or wearing revealing clothes in the street. I'm curious as to what strategies some of you who live in big cities have had to put in place in order to avoid that. Did you set up a code with your friends to check on each other? Do you carry mace around or any other object to defend yourself just in case? To make things clear, I know this situation is purely the product of a patriarchal society and that it is happening because boys are not being taught respect and consent. None of this is women's fault, no matter what we are wearing, where we are going or what time of the day it is.",1
Am I toxic masculinity?,"I went to a dating with a feminist lady today and I told her that I am looking for a traditional housewife, who can cook, take household responsibility and while I will take care of the household finances.

She was really mad and then she asked me that she is not really interested to be a housekeeper and she would like to have a career. I told her that her career would not be forever in her life because she is playing a big trade-off in her life with career and having kids. I dont think it is toxic masculinity at all. I believe that a man has to be the provider and protector for her woman and the woman has to be the foundation of the family by making kids.",1

How to deal with pua or other sexist groups as a strong and mature woman?,"I'm not sure if this is the correct sub to make this post, so I'm sorr if it's not this one.

English is also not my first language, I just wanted to make it clear.

I don't like to expose myself a lot on the internet, so here's what you can know about me: I'm a girl in my late teens, I have no interest yet in getting into a relationship. So this post is not about dating advise.

I recently discovered the pua and involuntary celibacy wold, groups that basically blame women for not wanting to be involved with them

I never felt so disgusted and discredited with humanity when I saw the materials post and idolized there.

How can a human being look at this and find it normal? Basically, the introdution of the book by one of the main ""God"" of this group, described that his greatest desire was to arrest all woman and watch them go hungry and begging.

Fortunately in the country where I live, this movement is little known, but even so I fear that this virus will spread here.

So, I would like to ask you, mature and more experienced woman. How do you handle the tactics of the pua?

Online harassment is easy to deal with. Ignore, report and block. But what about when you have an ""alpha"" in front of you?

How do you shut up its negs and other tactics?

Have you had any experience?

It is better to ask for when I have this bad luck, at least I am already armed and already know how to deal with them with class.",1
"Is a ""simp"" just the male version of a ""pick me""? And is it a net good for feminists?","I read a thread from a while back on here about simps and had a few comments say that it's good for the men to be raising women up even if he was only doing so because they were women and he was attracted to them and ultimately it was bringing women up. (Ends justify the means I guess). But wouldn't it be problematic for a man to put women as a sex on a pedestal? That's not equality. I'm aware of the existence of people who will use simp for anything including just showing women basic respect and decency. 

But when I refer to simps (on the rare occasion I even use the word) I'm referring to the type of men who believe women can do no wrong, who in any conflict between a man &amp; women will not only always side with the woman but will follow whatever logic allows him to paint her in a positive light even if simply flipping the genders would immediately get him to change his perspective. The kind of guy who sells out his self-respect for a little approval or validation and thinks little of both himself and other men simply for being men. As though we are the lesser brutes who should feel so lucky as to have a woman grace us with her presence.  The kind of guy who gets cheated on for years by his wife for months and then he begs for her forgiveness because he's not man enough and just wants her back. I can go on but I feel the point is adequately made. 

In that same post I saw someone making a comment to the effect of ""if a guy wants to pay a woman for her being on onlyfans good because shes providing a service and she should be compensated for it"". Which I agree with. But there is also a part of me that thinks ""yeah, but I can't help but wonder would this same man pay for said service if he was regularly having sex and had genuine connections with women in his life rather than transactional ones?"" I picture a lonely man who imagines a relationship with a woman who'd never spit in his direction if he wasn't paying her for it and who never will feel a connection towards him. And how he'd probably be happier if he spent his time and effort bettering himself, gaining confidence, working on his attractiveness, and putting himself out there to find someone who loves him, wants him, respects him, etc. 

Furthermore, because he's ONLY defending or concerning himself with women because they're women, he isnt really seeing them as people is he? The double standard reeks of hypocrisy when you just know  that his concern quickly drops if the situation were about another guy. I'm referring to guys like this and not someone whose just being considerate, defending a friend or being decent. I'm referring to the dude who will hold a door open for a full minute because a pretty girl is walking in that direction but would let it slam in the face of someone he isn't interested in standing right behind him. I know it feels good to have people be so considerate. But it just seems unhealthy at a certain point. And like it could lead to some bad outcomes. At the end of the day though, he is improving the lives of women around him, bringing them up and defending them. So is it a noble and ultimately good thing?

I might be in the wrong sub for this. In fact I almost certainly am(maybe shoulda asked menslib). But I've felt a lot more comfortable asking questions here now than before as a good deal of people here are damn decent and reasonable. And I am very interested on a feminist perspective on the importance of men's sense of self respect and value both AS men and as human beings worthy of dignity, boundaries, and compassion. It isnt the greatest concern in the face of issues women deal with XD but this is ask feminists and I did want to ask. Does such a thing even hold a candle to women's progression and success in society? If a man or a large group of men are eagerly putting themselves down to bring women up SPECIFICALLY because they value women more than men is it simply their choice to do so and a net positive because it's bringing women up?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Say that a group of men are doing whatever it takes for the validation, approval, and acceptance of women including devaluing and putting themselves and other men down/treating them unfavorably. Would it be considered a net positive if it brings women up?

"Why do some women gatekeep traditionally ""male"" hobbies?","This just happened. I was scrolling through my facebook feed and there was an article of a local website that said how the second season of Batwoman flopped. So I am scrolling through the comments and ok I see the usual racist and homophobic remarks (the protagonist and the actress, Javicia Leslie, is a black woman and she portrays a lesbian) that I come across on nerdy comment sections in my country (majorly white very conservative).

Of course noone objected to Ruby Rose being a lesbian during S1 but that is another talk. However I saw a comment by a woman saying how this is natural to happen (the show flopping) because women do not watch superhero (I do not know how to write this in a gender neutral way in English) movies/series because they do not relate to the protagonists and the genre. And that is why they make ""female"" tv series with many women e.g Gossip Girls, because it has many women and it is ""easy"" to watch (because yes Aquaman is super complicated to watch jeez) .

I got really perplexed. She herself watched superhero movies but other woman will not/cannot? How does this work exactly? What is their logic behind this?",1

Help understanding intersectionality between feminism and the modern trans movement,"(Very quick background: I was raised by a second wave feminist mother (and a father who makes an effort but is very much a product of his time) but went through most of my childhood in a very conservative area of the country so there weren't many other feminist influences in my life besides my mother until college.)

I am having a lot of trouble reconciling my understanding of myself and my own feminism and what I know about trans rights.  I would like an informed explanation as if I had been in a coma for 25 years.  I'm just six months shy of leaving the 25-34 year old age bracket if that matters.

I've read some things that are apparently said by 'TERF's, if I understand the classification right?  Some of it seems logical but some of it seems like bigoted bullshit.  I feel like I'm missing some critical information, but most internet searches have lead me to information that seems all in or all out and nothing in between.

Side note: I don't get the problem of the who uses what bathroom thing at all; if some creeper is going to spy on women in the women's room they're going to do it whether trans people are allowed in one bathroom or the other.  They're not worried about rules.  Weirdest logic ever.  Let people use whichever bathroom makes them feel the most comfortable and let it go, right?

Is it sexist or racist to say I'd never let a white girl cut my hair?,"there was a 'viral' video a while ago on twitter n IG of a white woman in my area (Dallas Tx) barber cutting hair in a black barbershop.

I reposted it on my IG story and said I'd personally never let a white girl cut my hair. I received lots of DMs from white girls thinking I'm prejudiced, racist or sexist. Personally, I wouldnt mind a black woman cutting my hair. In fact, as long as they black, they good in my book.  I've gotten a few haircuts from white dudes. But I'd never get a cut from a white woman. Especially one who has long hair, wears excessive  makeup, and doesnt look like the type who'd cut hair. People have no issues when others say they prefer tattoo artists who are inked up themselves. But the same doesnt apply here?

Is there REALLY a place for men in feminism?,"If I'm being honest, this question is better suited for a radical feminist. However, the Ask_Radical_Feminists sub is gone, and there's no other group about this...so I'm asking it here. Also, please excuse my english, it's not my first language.

Is there really a place for us in feminism? Can we really be accepted and work as an ally when ALL of us are raised to view women as just commodities for our own gain? If I'm being honest, I don't think we can, collectively at least. I think we're honestly too deep down the rabbit hole.

I've been in a road of deconstruction for the past year, trying to shed every misogynistic idea that was ingrained in my upbringing. Recognizing how women are exploited since birth, how they are denied basic control of their bodies, how they are relentlessly sexualized their entire lives, how POC women (especially black women) are time and time again completely vilified, ignored, abused, and massacred across the world, among countless other issues.

I did so, but I realized there are misogynistic traits in ne that will likely never go away, by virtue of being a man. I realized how there are things I'll never be able to truly let go, because of conditioning or plain ego on my part (as pathetic as that may sound). This made me think how the average man is so blind and so drowned in ignorance and sexist ideals...
I really wonder if there's an opportunity for us to genuinely be allies.

For this theory, I'd like to talk about certain things that a lot of people might find jarring or incredulous about the rights women had throughout the years. The thing that really spurred this for me was learning that women couldn't apply for a credit card without their husband's approval until 1974. If anyone would like to do more reading on that the subject was changed by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

Further reading spurred that there was no Equality Act added to the amendment. Protecting people on all levels of law.

Issues with co-opting spiritual movements women participate in,"This is inspired by a side conversation in another thread, but a thing I have noticed in spiritual movements I am familiar with - for me personally that‚Äôs Christianity and paganism - is how quickly women‚Äôs spirituality gets co-opted for commercial gain.  Whether it‚Äôs the Christian women‚Äôs retreats that are bigger on clothing sales and diet plans than they are theology or Salem being a ‚Äòfunky‚Äô bachelorette party destination and witchcraft as aesthetic.

All too quickly, it seems like any group where women show up, there‚Äôs this impulse for someone to jump in and try to shift it from the initial intention - women connecting to discuss and work on spiritual/theological matters - and to shift it back to more ‚Äòacceptable‚Äô behavior where women focus on things like relationships and appearance.  

Wondering what other feminists are noticing about how women‚Äôs role in spiritual (or anti-spiritual, as the case may be for women in atheism, who certainly face a fair bit of sexism and erasure) communities, gets co-opted and limited, and how you approach it and what your general thoughts are around how this plays out in communities you know.",1
How to explain the gender gap in nutrition in developing countries?,"OurWorldInData has [a series of plots](https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment) on hunger and undernourishment in the world.

There is only one chart that shows a breakdown by gender. It's about the percentage of children under 5 who are stunted (meaning, more than 2 s.d. below the WHO standard of height-for-age, reflecting poor nutrition).

[https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-stunting-male-vs-female](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-stunting-male-vs-female)

As you can see, in virtually all the documented countries, the rate of stunting is higher for boys under 5 than for girls under 5. The gap is not huge, but it is very consistent across different countries and cultures.  In particular, I find it strange that the observed gender gap is the same in cultures as different as, say, Peru and Zimbabwe.

Do you know what processes could possibly be at the origin of this gap? Is there any feminist scholarship analyzing malnutrition in the developing world?",1

Is it misogynistic to think men are treated just as badly as women.,Title says it all.,1
Is misandry justified if it will never be as big of a problem as misogyny or racism?,"Asking from a ""man""'s perspective not that it really matters:

Now there's prejudice against every individual. Does prejudice against a man simply because he's a man stem from patriarchal problems making ""misandry"" not really a thing?

An attitude I've seen is: ""Since men have been calling women irrational and ""triggered"" for a long time, it's now time that women show them they are that themselves"". Some point that out in a very hateful way. You know the usual KAM stuff etc... Ofc hate could be justified as I understand and emphasize with women's issues and the ""8000 years of oppression"". It just seems a bit counterproductive. I don't think it Is it a good way to promote feminism like this, combating hate with hate and I think it makes men turn away from feminism and engage in a hateful circle jerk themselves. 

I just feel kinda stupid when I see those things. Ofc, proving that I am irrational and ""triggered"" too and feel a connection to ""male"" values.

"How can we encourage people who say ""the world doesn't work that way"" to build a world that works that way?","Sometimes when promoting ideas like feminism, I've come up against folks who say things like ""People just naturally form hierarchies"" or ""One person looking for power over another is just the way the world is."" A common antifeminist anxiety that shows up on this subreddit is the idea that feminists want to ""flip"" patriarchy to create a matriarchy, as if this is the only way humans can operate, with one group dominating and oppressing another.

Granted, many people make this comment in bad faith. Often people with this attitude are just saying ""I don't *want* the world to work this way."" I don't really care about convincing these people. But I do think there are cases where people *want* a better world, but don't trust others not to take advantage of an equal situation to oppress others or genuinely feel that most of humanity is fundamentally selfish.

I'm curious about what strategies you all use when you encounter this attitude to reassure people that we *can* build a better world, that it's worth the risk. Or is it too difficult to distinguish the bad faith from the good to be worth our time?",1

What was your pre-feminism - nah I think genderstereotypes are stupid - moment as a child/teen?,"Hi, so I had a discussion with a friend the other day about traditional genderroles while growing up and how we only understood the idea of feminism in our late teens. At one point she shared the story about how her teachers back in school would always ask the boys to carry stuff like chairs and tables and whenever the girls wanted to help they were like. ""No that's not for girls."" Which ultimately ended in her going anyway and trying to carry twice as much as the boys did.

Funny thing is... I did exactly the same. Just as, I guess, a lot of other girls. 
And we were joking that all the girls who carried chairs in school are now feminists. 

So my question is: what was your -nah that seems stupid- moment when you where younger where you ""rebeled"" against traditional gender roles even though you didnt understand the concept yet or that it might be a stupid idea.",1
What should we refer to TERFs as from now on?,"I just saw a post asking about TERFs, and I hate that ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù is the F word in the acronym because they are not feminists whatsoever.

They are feminists who do not support trans rights, which you can say is bigoted. But however they are still mostly second wave radical feminists who worked for feminist activism. It's just that they do not support trans rights, as it fundamentally goes against their ideology which you can say is bigoted.

The White feminists of the first wave were criticized for being racist, but would you say that are not feminists too? Everyone still calls them feminist.

Is it due to them collaborating with the right to roll back on trans rights or that it makes them look more legit that they are by the use of the word ""feminist""? Just wondering I see a lot of this phrase ""TERFs aren't feminists"" but never really understood why.",1

I definitely feel such folk exist, and before I became a feminist and sex positive, my own moral judgements against premarital sex/lust were directed towards men and women alike.  My understanding is that religions and their texts especially that characterize sex as sinful, lust as a vice, etc irrespective of gender.  It just so happens that religious and secular societies tend to condemn women more than men, and that systematic violence punishes women more.  It also seems to mostly be secular societies that actively praise men for having a lot of sex.  

If the answer to the question is no, it also begs if the issue with stigmatizing sex goes beyond just a double standard?",1
Why should women have more maternity leave?,"Title says it all.

Edit: No it doesn't I was not clear. I am speaking strictly of non-medical maternal leave and in comparison to non-medical paternity leave.

But as many of you mentioned, feminism wants both. 

Many have said the media portrays maternity leave as a priority but they are not feminists, and what they mean is parental leave in general.

If a woman needs to recover no problem, that is medical maternity leave.

As far as taking care of a child, I think it should fall on the father if they wish to do so as well.

Uneven Maternity leave and no paternity leave (non medical) not only damages men who want to be with their children but women who are assumed to be primary care takers of their child. 

My point is not to say women don't need the recovery time, they do, this is why I clarified with non-medical maternity leave.",1

Is transphobia rooted in misogyny?,"I've been transitioning for a little over a year now and of course, I've run into plenty of transphobes online. I'm noticing a lot of them call themselves ""radical feminists"", but when asked why they think trans women are men, they'll generally say ""real women can get pregnant"" or something else I'd never expect a feminist to think defines womanhood. This has made me wonder if these ""radical feminists"" can even really be called feminists... or if they're just appropriating the word feminist to excuse their transphobia. 

Thankfully I haven't run into any transphobes appropriating feminism in real life and most people have tried to be respectful, but I've still gotten some transphobia.

How do I (19 year old man) support feminism without accidentally perpetuating the patriarchy.,"I‚Äôm not really sure how to word this question, but pretty much as the title suggests: how can I, as a man, advocate for women‚Äôs rights/be a male feminist? On the one hand, I‚Äôm concerned that if I speak too much, I‚Äôll come across as disingenuous, just doing lip service to feminism in order to get ‚Äúcredit‚Äù so I seem like a good dude (I‚Äôm sure we all know the type of person I‚Äôm talking about, but if not, look up the ‚Äúgirl-at-a-bar‚Äù women‚Äôs March SNL skit). Or alternatively, I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôd overshadow women‚Äôs own voices, like as in I‚Äôd ‚Äúmansplane‚Äù or white knight. I ultimately have not had the same societal experiences as women, so it‚Äôs not my place to speak on their behalf/explain their experiences with a social injustice (that again I haven‚Äôt experienced). So I would assume I should keep quiet. But then on the other hand, I‚Äôm concerned if I speak too little, I contribute to the patriarchal system because by staying silent I‚Äôm complicit in injustice.

My general philosophy, with really any social injustice, is to let those who have endured it speak to their own experiences, and I just help propagate that message; in other words, I let them lead the charge. But where exactly does the line between the two areas I laid out above lay? As women, in what ways can I be most useful towards achieving gender equality? 

Also, I hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as disingenuous. I sincerely am curious, but I wasn‚Äôt really sure how to ask the question without coming across as kind of a arrogant or like a white knight",1
Do you think it‚Äôs feminist for a woman to join the US military?,"I am from a divided household in which my mother is pro-military, while my father and sister would absolutely not encourage me to join the military.

I‚Äôm fully aware that both men and women in the military can be subject to those crimes, but it affects women in the military more. 

I am wondering what your opinions are about women serving? Do you think it‚Äôs more feminist to serve or not to serve? Is the military a macho institution that hurts women, or can it elevate them?",1
Are rape revenge films pro or anti feminist? Or just neither?,"Content warning: Discussions of sexual/physical violence.

I was wondering what some of the feminist perspectives of films like I Spit on Your Grave are, considering that sexual violence against a woman is at the core of that story. I always figured that it was probably one of the most anti-feminist films possible, consider its a series of exploration films wherein the main draw is sexual violence. And the movie shows everything in very graphic detail, and for a very long screen time. So right off of the bat showing something like that for titillation strikes me as a very  un-feminist thing to do.

But on the other hand I was thinking that I don't think anyone could walk away from it thinking that the movie is either in favor of such behavior, or that the victim is shown as responsible for what happened to her. And whatever your thoughts of graphic, violent retribution are, the movie really seems to relish in seeing the rapists being brutalized. And the films show the victim/avenger as getting away with it (well, legally anyway), so if the movie has any message it would be 'People who sexually assault should be tortured to death, and those who brutalize them should not be punished for it.'

That doesn't sound like feminist message, but it also doesn't seem like its pro-rape culture either. And if feminism is ultimately about fairness, brutalizing men who brutalize women is fair in a way.",1

Comeback for an ignorant person,"So, I first off want to apologize if this has been asked before, but I didn‚Äôt see this question posted here, recently at least. 
My question is this: what do I say to a female who believes that ‚ÄúThere should never be a female (American) president because females are much more emotional than males, it is a male job, and a woman could start a war in an instant based on whether or not she is menstruating‚Äù This was not stated quite as delicately, but that is the gist of her argument. I am also a female, and completely disagree with her sentiments.

I did tell her that ‚ÄúJust because she doesn‚Äôt think she would be a good president doesn‚Äôt mean she should bar that opportunity for an entire half of the population just because ‚Äòwomen have emotions‚Äô‚Äù

We may not always feel the same about everything (then again, nobody ever does!), but every person on earth has feelings. It does not matter your gender, sex, status, skin color, heritage, dna.... we all have feelings! A person that doesn‚Äôt could be called a sociopath, and are not fit to be president in my eyes BECAUSE they don‚Äôt have empathy! 

Back to the question- what do I say to this person?! She is incredibly frustrating. As a side note, I have to work in close proximity to her, and she has other gems of opinions such as ‚ÄúThe Capitol riot was a false flag attempt at a coup‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe scriptures say that vaccine companies are going to wipe out 3/4 of the population‚Äù and ‚ÄúA mask is a burka‚Äù.

How should a man feel about periods/pms/pmt etc?,"I've just read a thread on a facebook group I'm part of, about women in the group's period experiences. Here are some of the responses -

"" There was that time when we were cuddling on the bed, he was looking at his phone, and all of a sudden I yelled ""don't ignore me!!!"" And I started bawling. Just... Out of nowhere. Thankfully my boyfriend knows that it wasn't anything personal, it was just stupid hormones""

"" Last week I yelled at my husband because he used the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù utensil to stir his coffee  Then cried.""

(there are 50+ more stories in this vein)

To be honest, reading these have made me feel genuinely stressed and worried about having a relationship. Do I just have accept that women are childish, unstable and mildly abusive at this time? How much shitty behaviour should someone put up with from a partner that has periods before you call it emotional abuse?

I have some mental issues in my family members (both male and female), I have some trauma myself, and I'm really not good with people being unstable and fragile, even if it's just temporarily. I'm not really good at being ""strong for them"". And to be honest I'd have a hard time staying calm and compassionate with the behaviour quoted above.

[Male] [Question/Insight] Unemployment Insurance based on the medieval wage system in the US.,"I'll preface with reaffirming to myself and audience that I am aware that I would not know, what it is, that I do not know. That I could not attest to any opinion which would properly reflect the world beyond myself.

As most of us have come to be made more familiar with the mechanics of the Unemployment Insurance(UI) system in the USA, we can see that there is a crude eligibility screening for applicants. Determination of eligibility for a scaling amount of weekly benefit compensation, weighs itself upon the reported earnings from previous time periods. Thus, having not 'earned enough money' or a taxable work history can mean the DOL deems you not worthy to receive assistance, or very little of it.

Especially in a time where many have become burdened with lack of income, fair compensation and fair health environments during an economic shutdown and a pandemic assistance is critical. I would strongly argue that this system is massively a failure to women and a spit in their faces, when they have contributed so much. Many women take on burdening work roles which are not arbitrary taxable work history. Many women still live under the societal, peer, and familial pressures to be home-makers or work reduced hours for that role. Pregnancy can offset a reflective work history which UI is based off of. Obvious patterns of preference for males in many industries also hinders female record-able work history. 

Now American women, statistically receive less UI, if at all. I cannot know this and have peace. To have an assistance system which deems those who did not serve their lives to income verifiable by some agency. This does not represent me, and I feel it does not represent many others. How thankless are we to our sisters, mothers, daughters, aunts, neighbors, girlfriends, babymommas, wives and countless other shoulders of women that we (males) share our burdens and duties with. This is nothing short of abandoning women because of their situations that can largely be attested to a historically male dominated 'employment' system. These are official decisions which say 'you aren't significant enough' to give even meager assistance to them in a viral pandemic and economic shutdown. Women who have endured just as much, if not more, as men. Women who have given just as much, if not more, than men. Women who ARE our humanity just as much, if not more than, men.

And yet, they wait to recieve word of a paltry assistance which they have earned a thousand times over. Only to be told their history is not known of what they have done. Their history is deemed not enough based on how many dollars they had recorded for earning within this system. Their contributions, work, past year, sufferings, and value beyond recorded dollar transactions.. were not to be met with even the meakest of human dignities in assisting to merely survive. No. They would see you be abandoned, in this arena of fabricated inequality.

&gt;Therefore, girls are more likely to lack a [growth mindset](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/how-do-you-actually-develop-growth-mindset) regarding intelligence, and hence attribute their failure to inability, causing a decrease in [persistence and motivation](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/strategies-to-develop-a-growth-mindset), which has the potential to cause a decline in academic performance. This attribution was particularly pronounced for stereotypically male domains, such as maths and science.

 **Educational impact**

&gt;[Parents have differing beliefs](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1128973.pdf) about the maths abilities of their sons and daughters, despite actual performance being similar. Parents believe that, to [succeed in maths](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/maths-growth-mindset), daughters must try harder than sons and consider advanced maths to be more important for sons, as it enables them to enhance their ‚Äònatural‚Äô talent.  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, the stereotypical beliefs held by parents influence their child‚Äôs beliefs about their own abilities more so than their past achievements. This suggests that parental stereotypes may be limiting their daughter‚Äôs scope for academic achievement, an effect that may have long term implications in terms of [aspirations and career choices.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13803610600765851)

**Interests in school**

&gt; Evidence suggests that [parents are more likely to be involved with the school](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/29737745.pdf), such as attending school meetings and contact teachers, when they have a son. The same research also more worryingly showed that parents are likely to have saved more money to further their son‚Äôs education. Not having the same financial support from their parents may stop daughters from maximising their full academic potential. 

 **Time investment disparity** 

&gt;It appears that [fathers are prepared to invest more time in a son than a daughter](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/29737745.pdf), an effect which is thought to occur because fathers and sons have common ground and can share masculine activities. However, this effect is unfortunately not counterbalanced by mothers spending more time with their daughters (instead, mothers share their time more equally). Other [research](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1974-32082-001) has shown that parents are more likely to engage with their son‚Äôs play rather than their daughter‚Äôs. Together, these findings suggest that parents interact more with sons than daughters, which has an impact on their social skills in later life.

I have read many anecdote's online from women and girls who describe being treated differently from their brothers noting that they are often relied on for housework while their bothers are taken care of. as for me personally I have been from a single parent household (since my father died when I was 16 ) and have a sister, so these are all issues I've never experienced personally. 

I imagine these disparities between how we treat our daughters vs sons doesn't just have a negative impact on girls but boys too, in worse case scenarios where daughters are relied on for housework sons are doted upon, sons are left with poor culinary and household skills.

It doesn't seem fair that the Sex of a child's sibling should determine how likely they are to succeed in life. so how can we change this and why don't enough people know about this ?  

how else do these differences disadvantage both boys and girls?",1
'only in freeing the oppressors can the oppressed truly be free'. do you agree with this statement?,"i swear i've read it on a reddit sub and i just dont know where to find it anymore but it really struck me because of the thoughts ive had regarding the phrase.

in the context of homophobia (specifically homophobia targeted to cisgender men), i think theres a lot of intersectionality with homophobia and toxic masculinity. only if we rid men (specifically cisgender straight men) of toxic hypermacho patriarchal expectations can we truly be rid of homophobia. the way i see it, they feed off of each other, *men should act like this, men should like this, if you aren't, you're feminine, and feminine=gay, gay=weak/bad*. so in a way, the oppressors (cis straight men), if freed of the shackles of the system they themselves perpetuate, can finally truly free queer men of judgment from sexuality.

in the context of feminism, only in ridding men of these mental cages of societal expectations (that the man IS the breadwinner of the house, that the man does the LABOR, that the man SHOULDN'T be doing this, doing that, can only like this, like that) can we expect women to also, truly be free of the expectations of a patriarchy.

i would love to be educated and corrected on, but based on personal experiences with toxic family members, the quote truly made sense to me.

Are women the biggest cause of patriarchy?,"Sorry for the stupid question, but im stuck.

I live in a conservative country.  When i claimed men is the biggest cause of patriarchy, my mom objected me, claiming that women was, in fact, the biggest cause of patriarchy.  She explains her reasoning as this: Traditional family structure is much more common in here, and mothers spend much more time with their kids than fathers.  So mothers have much more affect on the childs mindset than the father. But since the mothers also value patriarchy, they construct their kids identity based on their gender roles. For example: ""prepare food for your brother/father, dress like a girl, why would you study?"" etc etc. They also flatter the boys too much by saying ""you are a man! you can do it! anything for my boy! find yourself a girl who can take care of you"" .  You get the idea.

Bc of this, she claims that women are, in fact, more responsible for this situation than men, bc they are the main educators of the children.

To me she does have a point and i dont know how to argue her from here. The debate can go to ""well but what is the origin of patriarchy?"" road, but we are arguing from the ""maintaining it in todays world"" side, not the origins. She also stretches her argument saying that the mothers become this way...because of their own mothers lol.

How can i debunk her? (without rejecting that mothers do spend more time with the children than fathers, bc this is sadly how my country is)",1

Is it really possible to criticize leaderless movements?,"Or more specific to this subreddit, is it possible to criticize Feminism and Men‚Äôs Rights as a movement? 

To preface: I‚Äôve never already discussed this with r/TrueAskReddit and they gave a lot of interesting answers/posed some equally interesting questions. I thought it would make sense to ask people who identify with an actual leaderless movement that I don‚Äôt particularly sympathize with. To be transparent, I‚Äôm a guy, I identify with left wing male advocacy and I‚Äôm very critical of a lot of feminist thought. Despite that, I‚Äôm NOT here in bad faith and will try to engage with each response fairly and honestly.

My girlfriend and I were having a bit of a discussion about leaderless movements such as feminism, Men‚Äôs Rights, Black Lives Matter etc. During the discussion, I realized that when we differed, it was because we often had different subjective experiences and perceptions of each movement. Looking at the discourse around each movement I‚Äôve seen that much of the disagreements around the movement stems from a fundamental disagreement with in the *essence* of a movement: whether a movement is really this or that. 

For example, a Feminist, seeking to discredit the Men‚Äôs Rights Movement, might point to problematic quotes from Paul Elam, Karen Straughan or problematic quotes from the MensRights subreddit. They might use that to say: ‚ÄúSee the MRM is a male supremacy movement that seeks to establish men as more important than women and maintain a patriarchal society.‚Äù A MRA might reply that those people‚Äôs are ‚Äúbad apples‚Äù or are simply ‚Äúproblematic individuals‚Äù and disavow them while saying that those quotes are edge cases that don‚Äôt actually reflect the values and aim of the movement. The movement is simply trying to give men voice and highlight ways in which men are institutionally disadvantaged in society. 

This argument can obviously happen in reverse using quite demeaning and terrible quotes from feminists that can be perceived as dismissing male victimization. And when confronted with the quotes/evidence, the feminist might say that the criticism lacks a basic understanding of what feminism actually is and what the values and terms in feminism actually means before proceeding to give a subjective definition of feminist concepts. 

Obviously this can go around for days and get absolutely nowhere because they‚Äôre both right and wrong because they‚Äôre giving subjective viewpoints of what something means and dismissing anything that doesn‚Äôt fit their definition. 

So my question is, is it possible to criticize movements that don‚Äôt have a central leadership?

EDIT:

I think this conversation has run it‚Äôs course for the most part and while some might think this is a unless rhetorical exercise, I still think this is deeply important because agreed upon definition is what create the context in which we can communicate about certain issues.",1

"Is there a better journalistic or media-based language that we can use with respect to things such as rape, sexual assault, sexual violence and the like which does not suggest that the victim 'had it coming' and does not always presuppose the guilt of the accused?","Too often the language in journalism and other media makes claims about things such as rape, for example, that make the victim's or survivor's claim seem dubious. This to me is immensely troubling.

Equally troubling is how it is often presupposed that the accused is guilty just by the reported victim's or survivor's saying that they are the guilty (**No, I am in no way saying, suggesting, implying or defending any claim or person who says that a person who claims to have been raped mustn't be taken seriously. This is absurd, unreasonable, and not acceptable, as it could impede justice for the reported victim or survivor**).

Both seem very, very troubling and damaging to me.

Do you believe it's damaging when people call themselves feminists when they aren't even educated on the movement?,"Currently, there are a lot of people who care about equal rights, I guess, but in general, a lot are also unaware of what the movement is actually about and are not consciously educating themselves on it. This leads to a lot of them advocating for feminism but at the same time also misogynists themselves(not purposely but because they were conditioned to think that way). So while they call themselves feminists, they also betray the cause when they interact with others. They don't deal with their internalized misogyny first before they call themselves feminists. I feel like this way is damaging to the movement but I'm not quite sure so I'm asking. 

I'm asking this because I'm also guilty of this. I called myself a feminist back when I was 16 and I didn't even exactly know what it was about. I advocated for equal rights yeah, I defended women, rejected victim blaming, spoke up against rape jokes and homophobia, but substantially, was still misogynistic without me being aware. Now that I've read more on it, I realize how much damage I've caused to the name. I undermined and put a bad image on the cause because I used the term haphazardly.",1

"Why is there little to no interest in regards to the effects of lack positive/safe role models for girl's/women? Most importantly, what are the effects on girl's/women and why are they disparaged, dehumanized and degraded for men's failures?","The only time I really see an acknowledgement (and a poor one at that) is when people mostly men say a woman ""has daddy issues"".  Of course this is just disparaging and gaslighting women for the failure of men in their lives.  The conversation surrounding boys/men is very different.  Not only do they dominate the conversation making girl's/women invisible but society has a hell of a lot more interest and compassion for boys/men that lacked a good male role model.  

One of the reasons I believe is due to the fact that men/boys act out disproportionately violent and destructive to themselves and  society in general.  It's another social problem where boys/men are the squeaky wheel that gets the grease.  While girls/women are disparaged and degraded by society for being failed by the men their lives that see's the consequences as something that puts women on a stripper pole, prostitution and of course having ""daddy issues"".

I can't tell you how many times my male co-workers praised me for simply being in my daughter's life.  My mere presence was saving them from the stripper pole/prostitution.  Because to men, ""slutty women"" is the worst possible outcome of being fatherless.  I wasn't praised for my presence with my sons, saving them from gangs, mass shootings, crime or drugs.  No, my greatest gift as a father was saving my girl's from being ""sluts"".  Despite the fact that many of these dudes would talk about exploiting women sexually that they felt had ""daddy"" issues.  They were considered easy targets.

My question is, why is there little to no interest in regards to the effects of lack positive/safe role models for girl's/women? Most importantly, what are the effects on girl's/women and why are they disparaged, dehumanized and degraded for men's failures?

"What is your opinion about ""strategies"" for gender equality (i.e: be more aggressive than necessary, for the benefit of the women who can't)","Hello!

Recently, I've engaged with multiple activists in my local context that have taken radical and strategic postures regarding multiple topics, and this has interested me. I've found myself doing so as well. I'll give a few examples:

* A fellow journalist is investigating minor corruption cases with me. We have a list of 200 people we're investigating. She insisted we focus on males first and only go after the women if we have time afterwards, since they are so easily targeted while the men are so easily let off the hook on these corruption cases. I agreed with her, even though this is _technically_ wrong from a strict, traditional, ""pure"" journalistic approach (of course, journalism has been taught with a male gaze, it's technique is not apolitical).

* A fellow classmate recently shared a tweet explaining how whenever another feminist says she's being ""unnecessarily aggressive"" about something, she thinks to herself ""I need to do this so that women who come after me don't have to"". I wouldn't disagree with her, it makes sense; sure, it can be disruptive In a bad way, but in my personal experience it is tremendously useful for other women to have an ally like that in the workplace, and to know that she can help them if they feel they're not willing to confront someone or something.  

* My boss (a feminist woman) and I needed to headhunt two colleagues for a gig doing policy reporting. We agreed to make a list of women and men, but contacted the women first to make sure that each and one of them would be presented with the opportunity before the men were. Sure, we _could_ have picked at random, or we could have gone for ""parity"" picking one man and one woman, but somehow we felt it was strategic to try to get even more women on the team. 

Since I've started actually working on gender equality professionally, I've seen a lot of people (including myself) adopting ""strategies"" that are geared towards long-term goals but that are not immediately or ""technically"" correct. I want to ask you what your view is on these sort of ""strategic"" actions that can be counter-intuitive or even considered wrong without context, but that quite possibly help build a real, effective gender equality. I suppose this can be seen as a re-hash of affirmative action but I don't think or feel it's the case: I think these are more nuanced decisions and they are, definitely, based more on political and ethical beliefs than on ""evidence"" or whatever.

Note: I'm calling these actions ""strategic"" because they do not offer immediate results, and can even be counter-intuitive in an immediate context. They are strategic because they aim to have an impact in the long run.

Still, I want to make it very clear that even if these decisions come from a political and ethical opinion and set of beliefs, and even though they are definitely not based on evidence, I do not regret any of them. I think that if I ask you to share your opinion of this it is only fair that I expose mine first: I think these sorts of ""strategies"" are necessary. Not only so: I think that any institution, team, workplace or community that supports gender equality *should* be thinking strategically, lest their ""support"" becomes little more than a good intention. This does not mean that I've not seen these strategies be unjust or myopic from time to time. Yes, they can fail, but they must be tried and implemented. That's my opinion anyway, what do you think?",1

What do you think of Female Gaze and Male Gaze in film?,"Recently,I found some comments on reddit and youtube, that said female gaze means inclusion of some shirtless muscle guys for female audience.  I want to share my thoughts though I might be wrong. I think objectifying is not good for either men or women. Fan service makes money, but not supposed to be a great art.  Most films in the past whether female led or not ,lacked woman's real point of view. They were portrayed as what men thought. Many women were even brainwashed by them. Lesbianism is a real deal for many women,but used and abused by hollywood as some kind of erotic material for men.Even in porn, lesbian sex is mainly for the hetero men. Only recently things are starting to change. Portrait of a lady on fire is the really great example. Although I am a man, I can really understand and feel the emotions of two women lovers,a very rare one. In contrast, blue is the warmest colour , with the very good story, is nearly destroyed by the unrealistic porn level scenes. Also, Little woman is one of the best film which can be enjoyed by both genders.For me, the female gaze means genuine depiction of women and exploration of their perspectives.
Undeniably the female gaze films are the real deal, and they are far from chick flicks and eye candy. But the major problem is still there, which is women centered stories are still underappreciated ,as seen in previous award seasons. I believe this is due to cultural and religious traditions, which almost always put women in supporting postions, so the wrong ideas are still ingrained in the society.We will see  whether they change in the coming season. Many have praised Joker movie as some kind of rebel man manifesto.Will they also do the same with Promising young woman?",1
I have some questions regarding the male gaze.,"I have been researching the male gaze for quite some time so I can have a deeper and nuanced understanding of the concept. You can answer as many questions as you like.

1. Since feminism have many schools of thoughts and disagree on certain things, **are there any feminists that do not subscribe to the idea of male gaze? If so, what are their criticisms of it, and do they hold water?**

1. During my research, I am getting the impression that the male gaze tells me how fragile the masculinity being portrayed in (Western) mainstream media. As a member of the 'stronger sex', I fail to see how we are strong by deriving power and status from the submission of anyone not us. Then the desire to overrepresent our gender comes across as narcissistic. Is this a common interpretation to have?

1. Given that media aimed for males can still incidentally garner a large female audience, **would you say the inverse is true**? In my mind, video games have a history of marketing towards males yet 50% of its audience is female. However, romance novels market towards women and [16% of its audience are men](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2016/romance-readers-by-the-numbers/). Does this trend follow for other media targeting towards women? Are men less willing to be fans of media marketed towards women?

1. To any women reading this: **Have you ever internalized the male gaze in your life? Do you see yourself as the human being you are or as how a straight man/patriarchy should see you?** Have you overcome this or are you still struggling with it?
 
1. I recently read and watch John Berger's Ways of Seeing. When he discussed the [portrayal of women in European oil paintings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZR06JJWaJM), this statement from him struck me: 

&gt; To be naked is to be oneself. 

&gt; To be nude is to be seen naked by others and yet not recognized for oneself. A naked body has to be seen as an object in order to become a nude. (The sight of it as an object stimulates the use of it as an object.) Nakedness reveals itself. Nudity is placed on display. 

&gt; To be naked is to be without disguise. 

&gt; To be on display is to have the surface of one's own skin, the hairs of one's own body, turned into a disguise which, in that situation, can never be discarded. The nude is condemned to never being naked. Nudity is a form of dress 

**Do you know any examples of art where naked women (or women being sexy) are shown as themselves and not for the male spectator?** Being portrayed as active rather than passive and available?",1
How to cope after your feminist awakening? (And everything seems sexist/harmful),"Im a woman. I've been a feminist for a long fucking time. But recently I've become even more involved in research and going deeper and deeper into the systemic inequalities that exist and how we can act in a way to fight them. Despite being a feminist for a long time, I call this my feminist awakening because I feel like its reached the next (metaphorical) level.

After my 'awakening', I've been feeling exhausted by all the mysogyny and patriarchal systems that surround me. I notice it everywhere. I feel suspicious of men, even those who are close to me, and I have less tolerance for beliefs that sit outside my own. I see sexism EVERYWHERE and I feel depressed and exhausted at the constant fight and fear.

It also makes me worried about what my life means now, when those I love may not have the same views as me. I try to educate them but I have a nasty feeling in the pit of my stomach that I need to be afraid.

Why is marriage depicted as bad for men and good for women," 

I've always wondered this. In pop culture marriage is always depicted as something men are running away from and as something that women want. Historically, marriage has benefitted men, as they gained someone to do hours of unpaid labor for them and produce heirs. Even in modern day society, women still do around 2 more hours of unpaid labor then men PER DAY. This is even after working the same hours at work. Women's careers stall after giving birth while men's careers flourish.

So why is marriage depicted as a prison for men and not women?",1
Are transpeople a great equalizer for gender issues? Is it trans-phobic to generalize any issue as exclusively ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs issues‚Äù or ‚Äúmen‚Äôs issues?‚Äù,"I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot and I feel like one of the most beneficial outcomes of transpeople becoming more accepted in society is that this has the potential to bring all genders closer together.

What I mean is that if we are to accept transpeople as valid, which we should, then all gender issues now become *human* issues instead.

No longer can we say that pregnancy and abortion are ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs issues,‚Äù rather they are human issues because trans-men can become pregnant and get abortions too. 

Am I wrong? Do I need to rethink this?

If I‚Äôm right, I feel like spreading this train of thought could be really great for men and women finding common ground.",1
Male gaze: Is it an inherently bad thing?,"I've always had it sold to me that the male gaze in films is a problem because 99% of sexuality in films is done for an implied male, heterosexual audience. Therefore any LGBT+ members in the majority of films ever made have had their sexuality ignored while straight men (probably mostly white too) are overly catered too. Which is true, I imagine. Aside form Dr. Frankenfurther from Rocky Horror (and probably Rocky himself from Rocky Horror) I can't think of any famous films wherein someone is sexualized for the titillation of someone who is not a straight male of the top of my head.

Now ignoring that for a second, is there anything actually wrong with films/scenes that titillate straight guys in and of itself? If a straight dude is just enjoy that Salma Hayek scene from Dusk Till Dawn, so long as he doesn't have any notions that his sexual enjoyment is more superior to anyone else's, is it really a problem? Or to be moral does he have to pretend that he's doesn't enjoy what he is seeing, or something like that?",1
Teenagers and Feminism,"Hey everyone! I am a 16 yr old high school female and a proud feminist. I believe in empowering other women and educating my peers (of all genders) about what feminism really is‚Äî equality. 

While I have always known that women face a magnitude of inequalities since I was little, I have recently (within the past year or so) become very aware of all of the subtle sexist things that I face on a daily basis at school/during sports, etc. For example: I am acquaintances with some funny/sarcastic boys, and when I try to make a witty comment back at them, they often don‚Äôt respond or look away. If one of the boys said the same thing I did, it would‚Äôve been ‚Äúhilarious.‚Äù This frustrates me, yet I don‚Äôt know how to respond to since I guess it doesn‚Äôt really matter and I would come off as overly sensitive. 

Another example is that I always feel like I have to prove to myself and others that I can be just as good as boys in school and sports. I know that this is not necessary, but I feel like there‚Äôs this voice in my head that tells me that I need to.

Why are certain groups of men (and women) so afraid of men wanting to be more feminine and the glorification of feminized men in the media?,"For some reason, there's this ""boogeyman"" that's been conjured up by certain groups of people who believed that the media and feminists are trying to force men to become more feminine and show more emotion and this is ultimately a bad thing. I've seen this fear being brought up over the years and now I've recently been hearing that people are getting angry over Harry Styles wearing a dress and this is an attack of masculinity in the west. An argument they love to bring up is that every society needs strong men to survive and to protect their families. 

Why are so many guys against this? I hate the fact that these groups of people also bring this fear to the dating scene in which they claim that ""women want sensitive dudes but in actuality they want tough and strong men"". As a guy myself, it especially bothers me that this kind of mindset is used as dating advice among men, both online and offline, and that we categorize guys into two groups. That being ""alphas"" and the other being ""betas"".",1

I [m25] offered to pay for something and was accused of mansplaining ?,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Girl I met on a dating app messaged me late at night for a booty call. She wanted me to go to her place and I wanted her to come to my place. This went back and forth for a while until I eventually told her to get a taxi to my place and I offered to pay for it.

She wasn't impressed and accused me of mansplaining.

In retrospect, I could guess that she thought I think she's in need of money or not independent or something. However my intention with offering to pay was only to reduce any obstacles associated with my preference (effort of traveling and cost).

Was I in the wrong? Is that even mansplaining? What could have caused offense?",1

For example if you ask the FBI why Al Qaeda attacked the twin towers on 9/11, they'll be able to answer you comprehensively and give you a detailed report, but of course at the same time they don't *agree* with the attacks themselves.

However, I feel that so called ""john-shaming"" (i.e., shaming people who purchase sex) is also unacceptable. I realise that might put me at odds with the sex-negative component of the feminist community but I honestly feel that if it's wrong to ""slut-shame"" than, ceteris paribus, it's wrong to ""john-shame"".

In the story, Mary being a virgin mother, makes her the embodiment of the Maiden Mother, fertile yet pure, and excluding the Crone from sainthood.

"Discussion about legal and common definitions of rape, along with the limits of ‚Äúprosecutability‚Äù in regards to ‚Äúrape by deception‚Äù. A philosophical conundrum?","I will first say what I mean by the title. My apologies if it comes off as incoherent - I can‚Äôt think of a good way to say what I want easily right now.

What I mean by ‚Äúprosecutabilty‚Äù in regards to the limits of ‚Äúrape by deception‚Äù is how well a law(s) (if they exist) can incriminate people for deceiving their partner during sex (like lying about who they are, or in this case, taking contraception) without falsely incriminating people who didn‚Äôt actually deceive (like forgetting to take birth control, but say they did because they mistakingly think so)

I was just browsing the sex forum and I came across this:

[Redditor claims his ex-girlfriend lied about using contraception, and tried to ‚Äúbaby trap‚Äù him](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/kww7jr/i_m23_realized_i_might_have_been_raped_dont_know/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

He wasn‚Äôt sure if he was raped or not. I commented in there right away saying he was, but was quickly corrected that the legal and dictionary definition of rape does not consider his scenario to be rape (USA?). However, I think the OP is from France, judging from his post history. I removed my comments because I was speaking from ignorance. Many people said he was not raped.

Question: If ‚Äúrape by deception‚Äù is not acknowledged in the legal/dictionary definition of rape (or not enough to acknowledge men being deceived), should rape by deception be acknowledged? How well would it work? Is it justifiable enough to acknowledge it in the legal definition of rape?",1

Are my parents right?,"Hi I am a 23 year old woman and feminist with a personal question.  
I've got the opportunity to be a model for a body positivity, lgtbq+ friendly overall amazing underwear brand (La Fille D'O). The style of the photographer and also owner of the brand is very direct; with visible nipples, hair and everything.   


I am an artist myself and my work is very much about the female experience especially about sexualization of our body. I go completely nude for my own photography, paintings and performance all the time. So even without this shoot my body is out there, in a direct way.  


I told my parents the news I would be doing this shoot. They had no problem with me modelling as a lingerie model, but they have a problem with this brand because it is too nude, too direct, overall not pretty. They came with the following arguments;

\- what would the rest of my family think? 

\- What if I needed another job which won't appreciate the nudity?

\- I would make their life harder by doing this shoot because they would have to face my family and, wait for it, their colleagues. My father even fears losing his job because of these hypothetical pictures.

This last one really stuck with me. Aren't they just making me feel guilty for living my life, which I try to live in an empowering way?

I am wondering what you think? Is there any way I would really be such a burden? Is this a valid reason for a 23 year old to feel guilty, maybe even hesitating doing the shoot to begin with.

Women should just lower their standards,"Edit:   
I don't know why I get downvoted but if it's because of the title I'm terribly sorry. I should've put it in airquotes so it's clear that this doesn't reflect my opinion.

Hi, I've got a question.

My brother and I talked about incels and their inability to have sex and I've stated the argument that inceldom is bullshit because in human societies it's the rule that everyone eventually can get a sexual/romantic partner.

A little bit later he stated that incels have it worse because men (and by extension incels) have it harder on the sexual market than women because women will always find a guy who's desperate and horny enough to have sex with her.

I was sceptical and told him that there are women who can't have sex like femcels. He didn't believe that they even existed. I send him this [article](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/femcels-vs-incels-meaning-reddit-discord) and we still had a discussion where he just repeated that men have to ""earn"" sex while women can just go in a bar and ask a guy for sex. In his view femcels could get sex if they just lowered their standards.

I said that by his logic an incel could just have sex with a sex worker and then he wouldn't be a sexless virgin anymore and he just responded that it isn't the same because they didn't ""earn it"" because getting laid is an ego boost and when you don't ""persuade"" a woman to have sex with you, you don't get that ego boost.

So...

How different would today's discussion on reproductive rights be if Silphium still existed?,"This might be an oddly specific question, but hear me out:

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently read a discussion online on reproductive rights in history and somebody brought up Silphium, which I found very interesting:

[Silphium](https://allthatsinteresting.com/silphium) was a plant used by locals of Cyrene (now Libya), and later the Romans, as a cure for various ailments. The resin from within the stalk would be used to treat nausea, fevers, chills, and even corns on the feet.

Its arguably most popular use was as an extremely effective form of contraception.

The plant acted as an abortifacient as well as a preventative measure. A single dose of the resin from the plant would induce menstruation, effectively rendering the woman temporarily infertile. If the woman was already pregnant, the induced menstruation would lead to a miscarriage.

Unfortunately, due to its popularity as a contraceptive and because Cyrene was the only place where the plant would grow due to a combination of rainfall and mineral-rich soil, it was harvested to extinction by the end of the first century AD.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my question is, as the title says: If this plant wasn't harvested to extinction, do you believe today's discussion on reproductive rights, specifically abortion, would be any different? I'm asking because back in the day, pretty much everyone had Silphium in their herb cabinet, making it a very easily accessible and commonly used contraceptive.

I personally believe that if such a contraceptive still existed today, it would heavily shift the discussion in favor of reproductive rights.",1

Why is consent treated differently for sex than in other situations?,"I was summarily banned from two X chromosomes for asking this, so I hope to get a better answer here. The stance by this sub seems to be that drunk individuals cannot give consent and that all sex with drunk individuals is thus by extension rape. This causes some issues when both individuals are drunk, which would imply that both are raping each other, but that‚Äôs not the meat of my question.

This idea seems to originate from statutory rape, which has significant legal backing and argues that children cannot consent and thus any sex with children is rape. However, this is where the parallels end.

Children are (in most Western jurisdictions) excluded from being able to conduct business transactions, since they cannot make autonomous decisions. If my child were to open a brokerage account and blow all his money on speculative instruments, I could take the brokerage to court for allowing a child to trade on their platform. If my child were to buy a car, I could return the car and get the money back or again take the matter to court. If the car were damaged, I would have to pay the damages since I am responsible for my child.

If I got drunk, blew all my life‚Äôs savings on speculative instruments and sued the brokerage on the basis that I was drunk at my computer, no court would rule in my favor. If I damaged someone else‚Äôs property while drunk, I would still be liable and have to pay damages. If I killed someone while drunk, I would likely get a more lenient sentence, but I would still do time. In no other context does being drunk absolve me of my responsibilities or nullify my decisions as it literally is my fault for getting drunk. What‚Äôs more, in the case of DUI, I would be punished under a law designed exclusively to punish drunk people deciding to drive.

My question is then why do some feminists‚Äîmy brief research on this sub suggests that it is the orthodox view here‚Äîabsolve drunk individuals of being responsible for their decisions when it comes to having sex? I don‚Äôt want to put words into anyone‚Äôs mouth, but you wouldn‚Äôt do it for any other potentially life-altering situations such as blowing your fortune on speculative financial instruments and forcing the brokerage to cover the losses, or getting into a car after a bottle of tequila.",1

Oversexualisation or slutshaming ?,"Hello evrybody.

Today I saw a press cover for a metal journal.
It was about a female frontes band and only the female singer was on the cover, in a very tight and very short dress with high heels etc... there was also a photo of a man on the cover : he was playing guitar at a concert. The photo of the woman is much more erotic and the photo of the man much more in context.

The other covers of the magazine are bot that bad but I realised that when they talk about masculine band they show the entire band and when it's female fronted band, it's only the lead singer in big.

It felt bad to me because I really felt like the lead singer was oversexualized. They have much more to offer than just their look !

But I'm conflicted because I don't want to shame someone to like dressing sexy or to like theses kind of photoshoot...

"How do you feel about Jordan Peterson's message that ""men like things and women like people""?","I struggle with this, because some of Jordan Peterson's messages bother me but others are things I've experienced in life. 

----

For example, right now I work as an interior visualization artist and I'm the only male on my team. I just notice that my co-workers prefer to talk about stuff like what they did with their SO's, social interactions that they've had, and when they mention things that they did on the weekend it's usually something more social or involving other people. Even the TV shows that they talk about like one called ""Love is blind"" or something is usually a TV show that involves a more social setting. I'm finding it very hard to have interactions with them that I enjoy because of how different our interests are and I'm considering switching back to game design.

------

However, when I use to work in game design prior to covid, my team was all men and one woman - and we talked about typical guy stuff like sports (boxing, martial arts, etc.), gaming, new anime fighting shows, cars, etc.

We always tried to include her in our conversations but she seemingly had nothing to contribute or had no interest, and she eventually quit for reasons I don't know.

----------------------

I guess it could just be a difference in personalities rather than gender, but when I started thinking about it I just noticed that throughout my life when I'm with men we talk about things or concepts but around women I'm forced to talk about people or social stuff.

How can I talk to my boomer dad about his toxic masculinity?,"My (26m) dad (51m) has fallen out with my sister (21f) because her first bf in years fell asleep accidentally in her bed, after my dad had said that he couldn't sleep over. 

My sister has mental health issues and I've not seen her this happy in years, her guy isn't text book bf material but he's clearly very good for her. 

When I brought my gf over for the first time my dad had zero issues with her sleeping over, he has zero issues that my gf is unemployed.

However with my sister. Not only did he forbid her bf from sleeping over, he also got so angry when her bf accidentally fell asleep in her bed. And he has been vocally bothered by the fact that my sisters bf is unemployed. When asked about this double standard he said something along the lines of ""it doesn't matter if his gf is unemployed because he will be working whilst she is pregnant and looking after the house"".
And he also has also tried to prevent and been vocally against my sister having sex, when he displayed no such aversion to my sex life. When I was sleeping around, I'd tell him where I was going and what I was doing, and we'd laugh about it and that was it. But if my sister wants to sleep with her actual bf, he has a huge problem with it. 

How can I show him that his toxic masculinity is ruining his relationship with his daughter. He won't be very receptive to ""progressive vocabulary"", and I don't really know where to start with him. I just know that I need to do something before it really does something irreparable to my sister and her mental health.

Update:
I called him, it went great. Thank you so much for your advice. I went at it from the angle of how its making my sister feel, whilst showing him how he treats us differently and how that makes my sister feel. I told him that he needs to tell my sister that he is not going to make it difficult for her to see her bf, and that he will be supportive of the relationship, just like he was with me. And he AGREED!!

If you could create your own society from scratch would you maintain the concepts of masculinity and femininity as something useful?,"It's hard to imagine that men and women would behave the same way and and have the same interests if there were no gender norms, but is there an argument that the concepts of masculinity and femininity are restrictive prisons for humans? Feminists spend a great deal of time and energy defending the value of femininity and talking about the dangers of toxic masculinity but is the ultimate goal to end these concepts rather than just redefine them?  How would it be useful to define gendered behavior if feminists don't think there should be any to begin with?",1

Insulting language that isn‚Äôt ableist?,"Hi. I want to preface this by saying my brother is disabled and I absolutely do not wish in any way to use ableist language or accidentally perpetuate any ableism, which is why I am here to ask the following questions. Also please excuse my usage of ableist and potentially ableist terms throughout this post, I just need to explain my point and obviously I need to use these terms to explain my point. 

I recently learnt that the term ‚Äòcretin‚Äô originated as a medical term, please excuse that I can‚Äôt remember the exact condition it was a term for. But basically it means that using this word in an insulting way could be ableist. 

This got me thinking, if I, and as I‚Äôm sure 99% of other people, are completely unaware of the etymology of the word and it‚Äôs links to disability, does that still make the word ableist? If the word only exists for most people as an insult or a variation on ‚Äòidiot‚Äô (which I also understand is problematic too), then is it ableist to use it if it‚Äôs developed waaaay past its original usage to the point where I‚Äôd likely say it‚Äôs not used for its original purpose at all anymore? 

I also had the question of, if I want to insult someone and call them an idiot, how can I do this without using potentially ableist language? I obviously will not use the word ‚Äòretard‚Äô, and understand words like ‚Äòlame‚Äô, ‚Äòdumb‚Äô and ‚Äòmoron‚Äô are problematic too. I just wondered if there were any words that could safely be used and considered not ableist. 

I do not want to come across like I‚Äôm saying ‚Äúbut why can‚Äôt I use those words!‚Äù I more so wanted to start a discussion on where the line of acceptability and non-ableism can be drawn in terms of this area of language. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve began thinking about and I think it‚Äôs important to recognise the roots of these words, but it is also important to understand the widely understood meanings of these words. Which is why I‚Äôd like some input from anyone who is willing to have an open conversation on this topic, and if anyone reading this has any varying disability themselves, I would extremely appreciate any input or opinions you have on this topic. I hope I don‚Äôt come across badly through this, it‚Äôs just a curiosity and a desire to understand the language I‚Äôm using and what words I need to remove from my vocabulary vs what is still acceptable.",1
"Hey, what are your thoughts on Rachel Dolezal and trans-racialism in general?","So I have always been very libertarian on trans rights and it still confuses me why many people make a point as to not refer people to their right pronouns.  


However, I am more sceptical of transracialism. It seems that people such as Dolezal are almost trying to have their cake and eat it, too; pretending to be black whilst enjoying white privilege. It is almost like she is appropriating oppression.

What do you think of Pauline Harmange‚Äôs ‚ÄòI Hate Men?‚Äô,"‚ÄòI Hate Men‚Äô (or *Moi les hommes, je les d√©teste*) is a book released this past August by French feminist Pauline Harmange that, according to Wikipedia, calls for a feminist reclamation of misandry:

&gt;	In the 96-page booklet, Harmange aims to ""understand misandry and to give it back the right to exist."" According to her, feminists have always needed to pretend not to hate men so as not to lose them as allies. But in her view, misandry is not only ""perfectly justified, but also necessary"". She advises women to reduce their relationships with men and toxic masculinity, in order to rediscover the benefits of the ""sisterhood"" among women.

Naturally, this caused a lot of controversy when the French Ministry of Gender Equality initially tried censored it for inciting hatred, which was eventually reversed when there was an outpouring of defense for Harmange and the book. It sold thousands of copies versus the originally printed 400, and will soon be translated into English.

What should be understood about the book‚Äôs ideas and controversy? Is there something worthwhile about adopting misandry into the feminist movement? Or would it be a toxic and disastrous decision?",1
Were the CDC 2011 telephone survey‚Äôs results misleading?,"This post is about the rates of male rape being reported.

Then they brought up the statistics of the CDC‚Äôs 2011 telephone surveys, and it showed that, prior to the studies, if accounted for men being made to penetrate, then men actually were raped at almost the same rates as women.

What make the distinction between hate speech and unjustified censorship?,"How can we determine ***objectively*** what is and what is not hate speech ? The definition is quit vague imo.

[Hate speech](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/hate-speech) :
 &gt;public¬†speech¬†that¬†expresses¬†hate¬†or¬†encourages¬†violence¬†toward a¬†person¬†or¬†group¬†based¬†on something such as¬†race,¬†religion,¬†sex, or¬†sexual¬†orientation¬†(= the¬†fact¬†of being¬†gay, etc.):

Does mischaracterizing a part of the population with erroneous stats on MSM or making a speech using it (which can lead to stigmatization of a population like crime for black ppl) can be considered as one?

Should every hate speech been punished, punished equaly?

Where do you draw the line between stopping hate speech and censorship?

Concept of revocable assent for teens engaging in sex,"This lawyer, Jennifer Drobac, works in sexual harassment law and has written on the sexual exploitation of teenagers. Her proposed framework for age of consent is: 1) raise the age of majority from 18 and 2) for young people within a certain age range (e.g., 16-21), allow them to ""assent"" to sex with significantly older people, such that after a time, if the young person feels they were exploited, they can retroactively revoke their assent, making the encounter nonconsensual. 

I understand that alternatives to this are to simply stagger the ranges in which people of certain age ranges can legally consent (e.g., 18 can only go as young as 17, 19 can only go as young as 18, etc.), but Drobac's assent law may be interpreted as more liberal, i.e., the concept of assent permits a 16 year old to have possibly damaging sex with someone significantly older, and only provides protection in retrospect. But her argument for this liberalness is that teens need to learn to make important decisions, lest ""we risk retarding their growth and maturation."" She then says that ""if we tell teens to ‚Äújust say no‚Äù to sex, we deny a normal part of their  development and sexual exploration that must occur in an  age-appropriate way.""

Opinions on this approach? Is it worth it, while raising the age of majority, to also allow older people to have sex with people below this bright red line, so long as they are provided protection in hindsight, so that society's teens can still develop normally? Drobac argues that this would be a powerful mechanism for dissuading many predators, because they may not want to have the possibility of someone retracting their consent, years after their fact, hanging over their head.

"How do you abandon the instilled, prejudiced image of a sexy woman, and refute the sexists' line, ""Ugly women's sexuality is a joke""?","The status-quo patriarchy forms the concept of 'women'. This male society condescendingly defines what a woman is/female archetypes. According to patriarchal society and media, our sexual validity is confirmed only when we meet men's beauty standard (which might vary by culture, but where I live, they place importance on youth, big boobs/hip, thin waist, long eyelashes, thick lips, pink cheeks, and this laundry list goes on...); otherwise, they don't consider us 'valid women' as in the line, ""Ugly women's sexuality is a joke"".



I'm 42 and aging. I'm sick and my face is pale. My body has belly fat, and my boobs and ass are sagging. So my sexuality is a joke? Patriarchal society and media every day teach me that my body doesn't conform to their beauty standard and I need to 'fix' my flaws to be sexy.",1

Does intersectionality affect grad admissions?,"I feel that white people AND men are given an advantage from the get-go \[ON AVERAGE\]. Men are pushed to pursue careers that require higher education. 

Additionally, BIPOC face an incredible amount of disadvantages \[ON AVERAGE\] which hinders their ability to pursue further education.

Wouldn't the complete success of feminism lead to an existential crisis for humanity?,"If gender is a construct, If sexuality is a construct, If we treat everyone equally, If we are nice to others, If we have respect for all professions, If we have socialism.

Like if we don't make fun of someone for being obese / looks, they are secure in their body, and they won't make any attempts to improve. If everyone has enough money to meet their basic needs, what is the motivation for anyone to work hard? Why should any woman want to be a doctor and not become a sex worker \[If they have the same respect as professions\]? Why should any man want to become a soldier or a coal miner? If all genders are treated equally, then why do we need relationships at all - can't I find both masculine and feminine qualities within myself?  If all races are treated equally, then is there a point to having different countries at all? Why is accumulation of wealth bad - aren't these just people who are good at playing the game that the society has set, you want to penalize them because they are good at playing the game? Do you think they are there because they cheated? Do you think you could do the things that they have done and not be like them?  And if accumulation of wealth is bad, then why work than the bare minimum if we have an Universal Basic Income? For instance, people get motivated because they want fame, respect, money, stability, academic merit - that would not mean anything then?

Regarding fictional male characters objectification,"Hello there!

I'd like to consider myself a feminist - I'm afab, and I see and recognize a lot of the misogyny and sexism that's in our culture. I've always thought that the objectification of fictional female characters is a real issue, however recently I had a discussion with someone else regarding objectifying male characters.  

Basically, I expressed how I found this fictional videogame character hot, and that was the main reason I liked him as a character. I was then told that was gross, and that I was being objectifying. I want to ask - was what I said weird, and objectifying?  

I don't really know what to think myself, because if a guy told me that the main reason they liked a fictional videogame woman was because she was hot, I wouldn't really ... be bothered? But maybe I'm wrong on that too, and for that reason I wanted to hear different opinions.",1
A question on abortion in a hypothetical ideal future: All thoughts are appreciated,"Hey, so curious it‚Äôs question, would there be an ideal world where abortions wouldn‚Äôt need to be a thing. As a person who believes in the equity of all peoples, being an anarcho-communist, and that kind of applies to the unborn for me aswell. Abortion is just a hard topic for me, I agree with a lot of feminist thought, but I can never really form a full opinion on abortion, so the best I can do is hope for a scenario where it‚Äôs no longer a necessity. So would you think abortion would still need to be a thing of in this hypothetical world(from an American standpoint) sorry non Americans if some of this already applies to you, we kind of live in a third world country pretending to be first world! But if you could give birth without financial cost(entirely free!) and knew that your child was going to be given another place(not necessarily in a generic nuclear family unit) to be fed, educated, and grow up to be a great person without you needing to take care of the child or even ever here of it again. And since we live in a capitalist society you could even get a nice check(my original ideas come from a non monetary society, but hace to update for more realistic sensibilities). I  understand the idea that it is a woman‚Äôs choice, and I respect that as I‚Äôm not going to bad mouth someone for doing it or be one of those weird people who protest outside clinics, but there‚Äôs got to be a way, right? Maybe it‚Äôs a bad example, I‚Äôm pretty bad at expressing my ideas into written word, but could there be a world of no abortions? Thank you for any and all opinions, I just really want to hear peoples ideas. I hope you have a good day wherever in The world you may be.


Edit: I wanted to add an apology for coming off as ignorant. I realize I have much to learn about this topic and am eager to learn from everyone here. I know this is a sensitive and traumatic topic and I probably come off as acting like a fool who thinks it mean nothing, and I apologize for that perception.

Edit+: Alright, thank you everyone for your insight. I‚Äôve learned a lot about abortion and a bit about humanity on Internet forums, which I should‚Äôve expected(I think someone with a lot of alt accounts just came by, probably).

What do you think ADOS (AFRICAN DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES) and their views on liberals and feminism as whole? As well as what you think of Pan-africans?,"ADOS means AMERICAN descendants of slaves. Basically, a black american who's here as a result of slavery. They're all around social medias. You can read about them, or I could post links if needed. But they mainly reside in the corners of twitter or yt. 

Pan-africans are black people who believe that ALL black people of african descent, no matter where they're from, should unite. What differs from ADOS and Pan-Africans is that ADOS are for BLACK AMERICANS descendant of slaves, and believe in reperations for them. And Pan-Africans is for every black person of african descent.

I've seen a lot of what ADOS/Pan-africans have to say. Particularly about politics and such. They're an explicitly anti-feminism group. They believe that it's a group for white women. Or white people in general. And often bring up their past as a reason they don't support it. And believe feminism is nothing more than brainwashing and a destruction to their communities.

In general, frrom what I've gathered, both groups don't support or vote for any politicians/candidates who AREN'T black. They only support black politicians. And only when these politicians made it clear they center black people in their TOP 5 priorities. Most of them didn't even vote (what i read again) in this past 2020 election. As they simply don't care, and see GOP and DEMS as political parties that don't care about them

Also, they absolutely has the term person of color. You'll get called names if you refer to them as that. Not to mention, in my experience, they tend to be VERY hostile towards non blacks.

So what's your opinion of them as whole? What do you think of them? Feminists who are black, how do you view? And feminists who are not black, how do you also view them?",1

I mean, it's good that they're given a platform in which they are in control, but I just can't get it off my head how they were led to this decision. Most likely, these girls were hypersexualized and fetishized when they were minors. I don't know if this is the right term, but isn't it possible that they were ""groomed"" to think that their body is for the public?

So why are abortions morally acceptable?,"Please don't just spam me ""*stop trying to control women*"" ""*women should be able to do whatever they want to their own bodies*"", it doesn't hold up. What women fail to realize is that we don't want to control what they do with their bodies, it's just that the baby isn't apart of it. And for those that think the baby is her body, how many fingers does a pregnant woman have, 20!? I don't think so.

Well some people might say the baby is using up resources of her body, and they have no obligation to keep it alive. Sort of like if someone needed a blood transfusion from you, you can decline because you have no obligation to anyone else. But still what women fail to realize is that there is a *big* difference between passively allowing a tragedy to occur and actively triggering the events that lead to someone's death. Not only are you consciously making the decision to end someone's life via killing, but you act as if getting pregnant was completely random and out of nowhere. The baby was asked to be brought into this world you're irresponsible decisions did that.

Another argument most people make is, it is a fetus and not alive. This is probably the most tricky because we start getting a little deep. What constitutes someone as alive? Is someone in a coma alive? I mean someone in a coma as *VERY* little brain activities, so is it ok to pull the plug these people? Are the elderly with dementia worth putting down because they aren't responsive to the world any more? Most people would say that they've already been living, so to end that would be wrong. And it's like what? A prerequisite to living is you had to have lived??? Anyways that's just assuming they think it's alive (at any point they think it is alive in the womb). Some people might say if it is in the womb it's not alive. We'll if that's the case what's the difference between a child that's just been born and a baby in the womb for 6 months? There's not a lot of difference.

The last argument many people use is what happens to the baby after its born. I understand that life can be hard and having a baby probably just add to the problem but that understands no circumstances can you just kill someone out of convenience. They usually go off on a rant about how the baby is gonna live a terrible life and grow up poor. But you have you have to understand, you wouldn't kill a 2y/o  because it would convenient you, so you shouldn't kill an unborn baby. People will also say what about rape cases? And if I'm being honest I'm not entirely sure myself. I mean on one hand a child of rape didn't asked to be born and in the other the mother forced against her will.

But anyway I think abortions are morally wrong and if you think you got another reason I didn't consider or a counter-argument I'd love to hear it.",1
Do you think there are any gender double standards that *should* exist?,"People bring up double standards between men and women very often in gender related debates. That if a man does this, he's considered X, a woman does the same thing and she's considered Y, and that's hypocritical.

But are there any double standards between men and women that *should* exist in your opinion? Like someone brings up a certain double standard in an argument, and you go, you're correct, that double standard does indeed exist, and that's good - because it *should* exist.",1

On Sex Work [and other things],"So, I want to know your opinion on some thoughts that I have:

1\] Say, even if we remove the stigma of the sex work, porn, or onlyfans, we cannot eliminate the physical realities of the act itself. That is, if we remove moral and social judgement, and ensure the safety of the workers, you still have two groups of people : women who engaged in such activities, and those who did not. What to make of the information would be at the personal discretion of them and their partners, but my point is that two groups will exist.

2\] Expanding on the idea of physical realities - When it comes to women being obese, or not wearing make up, or not trimming body hair, I think there are two separate issues here. The first issue is that no woman should be treated badly because they are obese, or refuse to wear makeup, or do not trim their body hair. Nor should they be forced or expected to wear makeup and trim their body hair - which is fair, and that is the way things should be. The second issue is that relationships operate as a free market. So you have to realize that your position there depends on your attributes -being overweight, not wearing makeup, or not trimming your body hair might affect your chances to attract a partner \[Again, this is true for men too, with different attributes, but no movements are based around men being fat, and nobody cares about fat men while fat women are put on covers of magazines\]. So these two are very different issues, and while

3\] Isn't porn lucrative for women BECAUSE of the side-effects that it has?  I mean, if there is no stigma and no bad effects, and if any woman can work in porn without having to face any kind of repercussions - personal or professional \[so easy entry\], economics dictates that it would become significantly less lucrative to work in porn. I have already heard that onlyfans is not as lucrative today as it was a couple of years ago \[the median earning as of today is $136/month\]. If you recall the porn from the 1980's/90's and compare it to what passes as 'vanilla' porn today you would see that the latter is more 'violent' and 'problematic' and the women probably paid much less than they were then, plus you have a lot of competition. Also, there is money in sex work because it is restricted. If you legalize it, it would become significantly less lucrative. because you will have a proliferation of women who want to earn extra money on the side as compared to highly vulnerable women \[like the ones who currently do sex work\] which will be blindsided.  Think about the Bella Thorne - Onlyfans incident, where she earned a lot of money. If other popular actresses also open an onlyfans account, what would happen to the average woman on onlyfans? Why would people subsribe to her when at the same price I can see the content of a famous model / actress?

4\] Leading up to this - I think that if there were a scenario were sex work, porn, and onlyfans was not stigmatized, and it was like any other profession, it would lead to more brutal hierarchies on a much basic level - like looks and race \[things you cannot change\] and lead to some weird type of progress that cannot be determined at this point. That is, what proportion of women do you think can make a decent living out of this profession? What would be the median salary be like? In most other disciplines, you can work hard, study for an advance degree, or get ahead due to experience. Due to nature of adult work, the only way \[that I see\] to increase your profit is to go towards more 'extreme' ways of sex - like just notice how commonplace anal porn is today as compared to 10 years ago.

Coming to the point about race, consider interracial relationships. There are obviously more interracial relationships today than 10 years ago - which you might consider progress. But most of them are between Black Men and White Women, and very few Black Women and White Men. Okay, maybe we can attribute it to say Black Men being well represented in sports \[American Sports\], the music industry, and let's also include shallow women who might date them because of them being perceived as well endowed \[due to porn\]. Even accounting for all this, I think the ratio is very skewed. In media, I hardly see any Black Woman \[Non-Black Man\] pairings. Even in porn, where you might see every possible thing imaginable, Interracial porn is mainly between Black Men and White Women. Also, Even amongst Black Men, only a very small percentage have the privilege of being good at sports, music, well endowed, the other Black Men who do not have such privileges are probably going to grow more resentful over time \[if they already aren't \].

My point here is, on the surface it seems like progress is happening, but it is leading to more intra-group issues with a potential towards increasing tension within groups, based on things that cannot be changed \[face, height, musical talent\]. Like Black Men getting involved in majority of the interracial relationships, Attractive women earning the most money on onlyfans. Though women have sexual autonomy today, There also exists groups like femcels who are women which have no partners  \[around 30k members on reddit\], and I think the problem of invisible women \[the idea that women who are not attractive are non-existent\] has become more prevalent today.

In the end I don't think there is a way to truly demolish hierarchies - you demolish one, and new ones will be born. This can be attributed to the fact that human beings have very complex desires compared to other species. You think about other animals and they are so happy with basic food and shelter. My opinion is that at best feminism will be able to remove problematic behaviors like catcalling, objectification, workplace discrimination, and non violent sexual assault / harassment, but beyond that it is just unfathomable what the side effects of the other progresses would be - or even if those progresses can be long lasting, since I consider feminism a privilege of the economically prosperous nation. With changes in economy, environmental degradation, changes in the nature of war, this progress might roll back. ",1

What are your thoughts on machines replacing humans in the future in these fields \[which is very much possible not too long from now\]? They do not present any of the problems that feminists are addressing today. A non human work environment seems like the most ideal one - it is devoid of sexual harassment and workers needing days off, at the least. For instance, we had sexual assault issues with uber drivers - it will be solved with a non human driver, but uber's main goal has always been self driving cars as cabs and transport logistics. There are just waiting it out until the technology becomes more safer and economically viable, which Tesla has taken major strides in.

One argument might be that maybe humans will pivot to tech careers. To which I want to comment that not everyone has the capacity, drive, and temperament to survive in tech. Also, being a software developer is radically different from working in a PURE Machine Learning / AI role.

Also, why are feminists focusing on getting more women in tech? As someone who was born to significantly well off parents and who has a high salary, there is no correlation between a high paying career and your happiness / fulfilment in life, which is why I think there are is lesser women in tech in countries with high GDP/Capita like Sweden. I don't mention careers like Medicine / Law / Business because you cannot make a 6 figure salary in your early 20's in those professions \[so the women in those professions are highly committed and have thought things through\] and need to get grad degrees to get top salary, whereas in tech you can get a decent salary even after attending some bootcamp. Moreover, it seems like you want companies to force men to take parental leaves too. Why don't feminists want to encourage more women to not have children, and encourage more women to have casual sex relationships? Wouldn't that be more liberating than women becoming mothers and basically companies or worse, taxpayers paying couples to have babies and at the same time restricting young men from doing extra work / overtime? Again you might say that ""well, a woman might work for less hours but she might do better quality work"" to which I say ""Surely, there must exist at least one man with the capacity to work more hours without compromising on quality""?",1

"I was having this discussion with a person and they said this: ""Toxic feminists spread a lot of hate and negativity with no feedback from their ideological sisters (like you), and you think you're entitled to public support. Why?""","There were a lot of arguments that they put like:  ""Why should I as a man support people who subscribe to an ideology that lets people that hate me run amok unchecked?"" and  ""As far as I'm concerned, you're ALL toxic."" and,  ""Since ""good feminists"" never do anything about ""bad feminists"" or even ""good feminists"" having ""bad moments"". "" and, ""So nonAmericans can validly know that most of the cops here are bad, but antifeminists can't validly know that feminists are bad even with an abundance of evidence?""

With instance like:  ""Toxic feminists have petitioned the government to allow colleges to expel students ACCUSED (not found guilty) of rape based on preponderance of evidence, aka a 50.1% chance that a rape allegation SOUNDS plausible."" 

And because I don't have enough knowledge for this, I thought it might be best to take it here. If I shouldn't have or anything else that might be a problem, I will gladly remove(or edit) the post.",1
Would a sociologically (and biologically) focused sex Ed classes help solve the sexist issues that hinder dating?,"Sex Ed should include teaching young people about consent, contraception (not just abstinence), male and female puberty. That‚Äôs what I learned and I believe I have a pretty comprehensive knowledge of the biological aspects based on that. 
However I believe a more sociological aspect also needs to be taught; how to conduct yourself around someone your sexually attracted to, how women and men differ,  how women and men are similar, that women enjoy sex too, and how people‚Äôs preferences in a partners differ (In features, sexuality and gender identity) etc. 

(Issues particularly in heterosexual relationships) I‚Äôve noticed, lurking on ‚Äúdating advice‚Äù spaces there are very many men who believe all women are the same; having the same preferences and believing women have it easier in dating. I think these are harmful, sexist opinions that stem from a serious misunderstanding of Sex and relationships. 
There are men who truly believe *all* women want is a 6‚Äù rich guy, disregarding the fact women are people: being taught that sex is something he does to a women not with a women. Assuming dating for women is easier simply because they are women. 

My questions for fellow feminists are; 

- is dating conduct something we should be teaching in schools along side Sex Ed? 

- have you noticed any other examples of sexism in dating? 

- are there any issues with how women conduct themselves in dating? 

- will a sociological aspect make sex Ed more LGBTQ+ inclusive? 

- What important things can be taught to make sex Ed more inclusive and less sexist?",1

"Feminists Livestreamers and Content Creators :How do you deal with sexism, on a mental &amp; emotional level ?","I have a few female friends who started Live streaming on twitch and youtube during covid and have been facing a lot of issues and harassment

I did already get some of the general actions and tips you can take

Have supportive friends or partners in chat, to talk with and help mod

Different games have different sets of viewers, so if possible try to find one that's less toxic.

making sure to take breaks and rests

While youtube and twitch have their official processes for dealing with harassment , reporting moderating censorship, muting, banning people

\------------------------

My focus for this post was how to deal mentally and emotionally level with actions, techniques

Feel free to reply on how you deal either in it general or individual issues I‚Äôve listed bellow

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Fake donations. Men who demanded my attention in chat and make me feel guilty about not replying or reading immediately.

Lack of communication or chat interaction without face cam. Insults on looks when I do have face cam.

One my biggest issues is that I don't get taken seriously, also I'm not traditionally attractive. Like I enjoy wearing low cut tops, like even when I'm not streaming. Like I try really fucking hard but this is difficult because of my mental health.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Not taken seriously, sexism, etc pretty much from the get-go. There are people on Twitch dedicated to harassing female streamers.

My successes are attributed to my gender instead of my hard work and talent

. A handful of loyal viewers who feel the need to defend or carry me, because I‚Äôm viewed as fragile and not \*as\* smart as males. Like it‚Äôs ‚Äúcute‚Äù that I play some video games. It‚Äôs strongly affected my personal bias towards my male viewers and that sucks because I know not all of them are like that, but when it happens a LOT more to women than it does to men...we kind of just assume first.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The relentless focus on physicality and age is just one of the challenges female creators face. There is a ton of harassment, stalking, threats.

have been at the burnout stage several times - due to harassment.

I don‚Äôt know how to advise, other than to simply take breaks when necessary. Thanks for this post and I think that perhaps younger women, or those who don‚Äôt have a very large following (or those who are ignorant) may be in denial about how the female experience differs to the male experience. There is a lot of unlearning to do.

People commenting negatively on my appearance- makeup, clothing etc. When it has nothing to do with my content at all. I don't do fashion, beauty, lifestyle etc. It's irrelevant. I'm sure most creators experience this at some point though, not just females

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

there is an element of ""why would i take advice from a female who can't even get her makeup/hair/outfit right"" that does seem mainly reserved for female creators. And getting the opposite ""you're so pretty you deserve more subs"" isn't less offensive.

Just scroll through comments of male creators vs females - and count how many comments relate to appearance vs content. The proportions are wildly different - even when the genre is unrelated..

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

All you see in my videos is an angle from above of a piano keyboard, my hands playing the said keyboard, and my legs underneath. The amount of times I get comments about my legs is ridiculous... ""cover them up, I can't concentrate"" and the like. I've had marriage proposals because ""your hands are beautiful, imagine what else you can do with them"" etc etc. It's a good thing I don't show my face... can't imagine how much worse things would be ???? I don't get too much harassment specifically for being female though I do get the odd ""it would sound so much better if a guy played this music"" ?

"What is your response to men who claim doing sex work is harmful to oneself and others, among other criticisms?","I had an interesting debate the other day with someone who said along the lines of:

- What if the sex worker has children, and the children find out their parent was a sex worker?

They said that the children would probably feel ashamed/embarrassed. Therefore, it‚Äôs wrong.

- How would *you* feel if you found out your parent was a sex worker?

I said in response it doesn‚Äôt matter how I feel about what they do, (I would admittedly feel embarrassed) I respect their choice in bodily autonomy. Who am I to tell what job someone should have?

Then, this was not part of the debate but I thought of it: 

- They brought up that sex workers/nude models have a hard time dating because of their line of work.

- Would I date a sex worker? 

I watch pornography, but I most likely would not date a pornstar out of insecurity/jealousy. Am I a hypocrite?

I notice something too, how many men will shame women for having an Onlyfans (‚Äúit‚Äôs not a real job‚Äù, ‚Äúthey are making money off of simps‚Äù, ‚Äúthese women are selling their body‚Äù) yet they will still masturbate to it.

A thread on askmen was something along the lines of: ‚ÄúWould you feel disappointed in your daughter/son if they became a sex worker?‚Äù and the vast majority of them said yes. Similar threads to that had similar results.",1
Should we try to eradicate preferences that are rooted in sexism?,"Not a regular in this sub, but I assume that there's a lot of threads asking about whether a preference (especially when it comes to attraction) is rooted in sexism.

A classic example would be that in cishet culture, height is a heavy factor when it comes to being attractive. Men typically prefer women shorter than them, and women prefer men taller than them. For some, it's even a deal-breaker. We can trace this back to the patriarchal notion that men have to be strong, protective, and dominant, while women have to be small, weak, and submissive.

Most feminists I've asked about this in real life have more or less said the same thing: 

""Yes, they are at least partly rooted in sexist notions, but everyone is entitled to their preferences. What's important is that we acknowledge that our individual preferences may be influenced by cultural factors and don't look down on those we don't find attractive.""

Personally, I agree with this conclusion.

However, one friend told me her opinion that really intrigued me. She said that we have to try to unlearn these preferences, especially if we acknowledge that they are caused (or at least influenced) by patriarchy. Because by respecting and accepting these preferences, we are also respecting, normalizing, and further perpetuating these harmful patriarchal notions which make them even harder to combat in the long run. 

I responded by saying that we can't blame individuals for being affected by the system. We need to go after the system itself.

She responded by saying that these are not mutually exclusive. These are still symptoms of patriarchy that we must also combat, the same way with how we fight ""petty"" sexist jokes while also demanding equal pay.

I'm curious what other feminists think about her opinion!",1
Wage gap question,"I have a real question but i dont want to trigger anyone. You have to understand i started my career right out of highschool in a blue collar 99% male profession. I'm not saying anyone is right/wrong or good/bad, i just want to catch some takes on the following completely hypothetical situation.

Jack and Jill are a married couple who got laid off. They can't find work in their field and the only option they have is roofing. Both have no experience in roofing and get hired by a contractor. The contractor starts Jack off at $20/hr, and Jill off at $15/hr because he believes Jack is stronger and can do more work. This is obviously discrimination... 

Now lets say both Jack and Jill start off at $18/hr. After 1 month it's been determined that Jack can finish and entire roof in 1 day, while the same roof for Jill takes her 2 days. Would it be fair to give Jack a raise to $36/hr, but no raise to Jill because they are both being paid at the at same rate (roofs completed per day)?

If this is discrimination how is it rectified? Should Jack be told to slow down and take more cigarette breaks? Should they be paid the same base salary and incentivized a commission or bonus based on how many roofs they can complete to everyone to keep moving?",1

"From a feminist perspective, how important is sex to everyday life/quality of life?","Assuming that you aren't an asexual you'd generally desire sex. And the amount you'd want to have varies from person to person. So, with that in mind, how important is it really? A point often posted here is ""no one dies from lack of sex"". which is true buuut when you look at subs like the dead bedrooms and such you'll see that a lot of people feel VERY hurt by a partner that is not physically affectionate with them. And while it does not merit outrage being rejected sexually can hurt especially if it's a repeated experience. some experience days, weeks, months, or for some years of not feeling that desire and affection from others. At least not from anyone they'd welcome it from. 

Yeah there are more important things. But that can be said about a lot of things. It's all relative. So relatively speaking how important is sexual attention, affection, reciprocation and such? Considering that you don't need it to live, would the lack of it coupled with the feeling that no one will ever desire you in such a way have any actual harmful effects? IS it at all important? Or could you be expected to die a virgin who desires sex and shouldnt be bothered by it?",1

Discussion: not conforming to gender norms seems more stigmatized than conforming?,"The portrayal of a ‚Äòpick me‚Äô usually tends to be women shunning traditionally feminine things.  While negative stereotypes exist about women who love femininity, it seems less stigmatized in that it‚Äôs considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or even favorable.  Same goes for men involved in traditionally masculine things.  

As a basic example, traditionally ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù or ‚Äúgothic‚Äù things are stigmatized moreso than women loving fashion and makeup or men (or even women, given the overall favoring of masculine things) loving sports. By stigma, I mean in the sense of being ‚Äúodd,‚Äù ‚Äúweird,‚Äù or just ‚Äúdeviant‚Äù from the norm.  Media itself perpetuates these kind of stigmas, and perhaps there is more to such stigmas in addition to not fitting gender norms? 

Men conforming to masculinity and women conforming to femininity seem to gain a certain power and social status, and in many settings can practice judgement against people of all genders who may be ‚Äúnerdy,‚Äù ‚Äúgothic,‚Äù etc.  I think the gamer girls who develop the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like other girls‚Äù resentment also come from having faced ostracization from feminine girls and more acceptance among fellow ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù guys (not justifying by any means).  

This is a discussion in that I‚Äôm sharing based on my observations and would love to hear others‚Äô observations and experiences.  Maybe there are also differences in what‚Äôs more stigmatized by environments and age groups?

Disclaimer 1: I apologize for any cisnormative language.  I‚Äôd love to hear perspectives from trans/non-binary folk.  

Disclaimer 2: If it‚Äôs relavant, I‚Äôm a cis woman, and I practice femininity to a small extent (on occasion).",1
Do you think the 3 year prison sentence on Sarah-Jane Parkinson was just?,"Sarah-Jane Parkinson is an Australian pathological liar that falsely accused her then fiance, Daniel Jones, of 32 counts of rape and domestic abuse.

Additionally, this left the Jones family destroyed.  Over the course of six years, the legal fees left his parents in debt of $300k.  This also caused his parents marriage to fail.  They will not receive anything back from the fees paid and no compensation for the damage done.

Honest Questions,"

"Why is sexist jokes towards men fine in feminist circle, but not the reverse?","Often times, I see feminists taking sexist jokes directed towards women seriously. And will then say that 'jokes are supposed to be funny'. Which they do have a point on that. But just look at feminists dismissing Clementine's sexist jokes as 'not a big deal' and bc she 'apologized'. Ur apology isnt sincere and doesnt mean much when you keep on repeating the same 'mistake' over and over again, and that you're known for that very thing. And other feminists argument against not doing anything about misandristic jokea? Women are dying, they say. Yeah, but a MUCH bigger of men are dying tho.

But then, these same feminists make sexist jokes about men. And when men react, we're dismissed as ""fragile men"", male tears, and the like. That they often call us privileged white men (I didnt know not agreeing with a sexist joke made me white. Interesting.)

Why is it that sexist jokes towards men is fine, but not the reverse, in feminists circle?

"Pro-prostitution feminists, how do you want to end the commodification of women?","Hello everyone!

I have only recently started to study the views of feminists. One thing I really like about it, is that feminism strives to end the commodification of women. As far as I am concerned, standing against prostitution - like anti-prostitution feminists do - and other kind of sex workers, could, in my opinion, help the situation. But so far I don't know how pro-prostitution feminists think that this problem could be tackled. I mean, people who engage in such activities (either by being a sex worker or paying for the service), greatly contribute to this phenomena.

So with this in mind, my question would be, what measures would you want to be taken and by whom to end/decrease the  commodification of women, if you support any type of sex work (be it prostitution, OnlyFans or whatever)?",1

What's your opinion of difference feminism?,"Hi :)

I'm doing A-level politics and we're studying Feminism as one of our ideologies, so any replies to this would help me understand it better :) 

We've briefly skipped over difference feminism and what it is, but it's generally overlooked because, as the textbook stresses, its ""extremely controversial among other feminist groups"" and difference feminists are only a minority. 

Although I wouldn't necessarily agree with it, it doesn't seem too extreme (as I would argue separatism is, though we skipped over that as well) or particularly controversial to disregard it completely. I feel like the exam board are being very careful about the content they include to not portray feminism as an anti-men movement, so really emphasise equality feminism.

Is difference feminism as controversial and a small a minority as the exam board/textbooks are saying? What's your opinion on it, are you a difference feminist?

How has slut-shaming and the way society frames women and sex poorly effected your sex life?,"The internet is, even at the best of times, a cesspit of misogyny and slut-shaming. Full to the brim with ‚Äúscientific facts‚Äù used to shame women for having sex, eg;

- multiple sexual partners stretch the vagina (but the same amount of sex with one person doesn‚Äôt have the same effect) 

-women who have had sex with more than two partners are more likely to get divorced.

Along with these, a plethora of misconceptions and hypocrisies regarding how men and women differ sexually‚Äî *men enjoy sex while women are meant to make sex enjoyable for men‚Äî women must be virginal and innocent but they must also be good at it and know how to please ‚Äúher man‚Äù, men on the other hand can be selfish in sex and have had many sexual partners.* 

Even off the internet people are so quick to slut shame someone simply because they don‚Äôt like that person, or a loose rumour.

**My personal experience, and how this has severely effected my sex life:**

I was fairly late losing my virginity (19) *in comparison to my friends* , the day after I lost it to the guy I thought would be my first real boyfriend, he broke things off over text and ghosted me. He was keen to ‚Äúplay the field‚Äù. 
The next time I had sex was a one night stand that turned into a relationship with whom I later found out to be a serial cheater. Many people called me a slut behind my back for this. He was a narcissist and very selfish in sex, but I didn‚Äôt know better. I finally ended things with him and went on to have several drunken ‚Äúone night stands‚Äù with guys I was/ am friends with in the years since. 
I‚Äôm now in my mid twenties and consider myself extremely inexperienced; I‚Äôve never really enjoyed sex, haven‚Äôt had sex sober in years out of shame and get very uncomfortable when anyone talks about it. And yet because I‚Äôve had more than 15 sexual partners I‚Äôm considered an unmarryable ‚Äúslut‚Äù by the standards of men online. As you can imagine this is rather confusing and damaging. 

This is just my personal experience and I‚Äôm dealing with it how I see fit. 

**So my questions are**

- has slut-shaming and misogyny effected your sex life? What‚Äôs your story? 

- how can we change things? Does the fault lie in sex Ed?",1

Surely its not because of the wage or wealth gap, most pornography these days is free, and as for prostitution, the EXTREME discrepancy is female prostitutes catering men and male prostitutes catering to women doesn't seem to be explainable by any sort of economic inability for women to afford a male prostitute. Is it a power thing, men sort of subconsciously objectifying women in a way that women don't generally do to men? In a society that regarded men and women as truly equal, would prostitution die out or be highly diminished, including prostitution where the woman is doing so voluntarily? The same question for pornography. 

Is it not a power thing but something else?",1

GF used to be a willing side chick,"The relationship dynamic was one of objectification. The married guy objectified her and she liked it basically. His friends knew about this dynamic and they both got off on it when they hung out with them. The sex life was of the similar tone (him being really dominant and her doing whatever he asked of her). GF says she still likes being objectified and they broke off the hookup because of his marriage not because of how the relationship was structured. I've explained to her how getting off on objectification could be pretty dangerous for her psyche and she agrees, but the pleasure aspect is still there.

Not that it changes much but I've been with quite a few people who've been with quite a few people and it has never bothered me. No matter how graphic they were in describing their sex life.

This one got to me though. I'd like to consider myself a feminist (not a good one apparently) and want to get past this. One the one hand unlike some feminists I think there's actually an immoral aspect to her behavior. Namely that she has been immoral to herself in rejecting her humanity (by objectifying herself willingly). Of course there are societal factors as to why she's in the predicament she's in, but at the end of the day I believe that we can still choose freely (with bigger or smaller inclinations).

Honestly I don't care about him, this is not about jealousy as much as it is about her pleasure derived from objectification in that relationship bothering me.

I'd like to get a grip of this issue and would like to hear some possible arguments as to why I shouldn't consider it a big deal. I'm really posting this to change my mind.

Feeling a sense of failure after being sexually assaulted,"I went home alone on my city‚Äôs public transit system recently after having dinner with a friend. A man got on my train and immediately began to sexually harass me. It turned into assault when I tried to move away from him. Being in a moving train car felt like being trapped in a cage with him. It was awful. It felt like an eternity before we reached the next station. I bolted from the train and the station as quickly as possible. Then I stood outside crying until I was calm enough to go back into the station and report the incident.

I knew they would have security camera footage, but even so, I felt unhelpful. The police asked me if I knew what time the incident began. I did not know exactly. They asked for a physical description, but he had been wearing a face mask and I avoided eye contact with him. They asked if I knew what specific train/train car number I had been on. I didn‚Äôt know. They asked if I had taken a picture of him. I had not.

Are most people in these situations really calm, collected and bold enough to gather all of this information while attempting to remain as safe as possible? Am I just really bad at this? I almost didn‚Äôt even go back and report it. I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it or be involved in a potential legal case, and I didn‚Äôt feel like I had enough solid information. I feel like I panicked and failed. When I was sexually assaulted in my early 20s, I felt guilty for a long time because I felt I should have been able to prevent it. This time, in my  early 30s, I feel a sense of guilt because it feels like I didn‚Äôt react correctly. I don‚Äôt know if this is common.",1
Gendering of Certain Products for Men,"Question (explanation will follow):
Is the gendering of products like makeup/face soaps/etc for men (i.e. calling it Scooter McShooterface's Guy Liner for men) a product of toxic masculinity/fragile guy egos or is someone who leans towards buying ""for men"" products showing toxic masculinity. This being a really positive sub who can explain things, I was hoping yall could weigh in. 

Background:
I was on Twitter and saw the debate about gendered products (it was makeup for men). Most of the sides were saying that these products need not be gendered and gendering them is catering to fragile masculinity.

Now as someone who buys a lot of nice soaps/deodorants/etc i had a question or caveat to this i find the ""for men"" label helps. It tells me that the product has a better chance of working for my skin/being more effective. Some gender neutral products/ones that aren't excitedly made for men are not as effective on my skin from a moisturizing point or do a bad job of making me feel clean/stop B.O. knowing this i wonder if it is toxic or fragile to prefer that a product is gendered b/c it tells me about the product in two words.

What and who are AryanRadFemsUnity/Aryan Action Against Pornography and are they connected to radical feminism like they claim?,"Hello, i was browsing gab, which is this weird far right twitter clone for old people and racists, just looking and laughing at all the man trump supporters claiming that trump has won and will be still in power, etc

When i came upon a two groups, one called ""Aryan Action Against Pornography"" and another one called  ""Aryan Rad Fems Unity"". I wont link them here as i do not want to give them publicity and i am not sure the rules on it. 

The Aryan Rad Fems Unity group claims to be a group of ""radical feminists"" based in US and Canada. The group has a lot of transphobic posts, mostly memes, and celebrated some law in the uk stopping transgender stuff for under 18's. They mostly target sex workers and the porn industry however. 

The posts of these groups are pretty racist, homophobic and transphobic. They both post about how porn is  apparently turning children LGBT (often calling homosexuals and trans people slurs) and how it normalises ""interracial rape"" to children, other posts talk about mass doxing of both porn watchers and performers and calls for ""punishments"" to those people. Seems like both group are pretty small but are armed with some guns and have ""connections within"" the RMCP as one post is a member posing next to a RCMP suv with an AK rifle. Both groups have posts that have nazi symbolism in them. 

I could not find anything else on them.

The ""Aryan rad fem unity"" account seems related to the whole Exdous Cry group, since they have photos of members wearing a t shirt from that ""trafficking hub"" thing. The daily beast exposed the group behind that campaign of being related to a radical religious sect in that is fiercely anti-abortion, anti-LGBT and anti-sex work. They helped put money into an anti-LGBT law in Kenya as someone pointed out on twitter. Someone who i talked to about this last night said that the group was probably some christian extremists like the army of god that targeted and killed abortion doctors.

i am not sure if i am able to link a screen shot of the group (in imgur) but i will post one if its allowed. I am sorry if this is against the rules.",1
"Is it wrong to portray women in idealized, sexual ways?","Yesterday there was a pretty popular thread on r/Art with a painting of an Asian girl in her bra drinking her morning coffee. It was a very good painting in terms of technical skill but the subject matter seemed to revolt some people. They started pointing out details like they wouldn't wear a push-up bra in the morning and stuff like that. One redditor called it a ""male gaze"", which I didn't even know what it was at the time but she defined it in a later comment as a ""made for the viewing pleasure of heterosexual males"" and went ahead to point out that real-life women don't look like that. I'll go ahead and post my response:


&gt;Art would be boring if it was all realistic. Have you noticed how in Da Vinci's Last Supper painting, everyone sits on one side of the table, even though it would be a lot more convenient to use both sides? Da Vinci painted an idealized version where all the disciples are displayed in a row so that they will all be visible to the viewer. It's illogical from a pragmatic standpoint but it makes the painting better.

&gt;In the same vein, I don't think there's anything wrong with an exaggerated, illogical and vaguely sexual depiction of a girl drinking coffee, just as I don't find anything wrong with a statue of naked muscle-hunk Hercules chocking Cerberus and saying ""I am tough and good in bed""


She responded that this sexualized depiction of women causes misogynistic attitudes and human trafficking. I'll be honest, I didn't understand that at all. Why is it that the sexual depiction of women immediately alludes to rape and sex trafficking? Cannot women just be flirty and promiscuous because they want to? Why is it that if I draw an unrealistically handsome guy with a seductive gaze, he is just a seductive guy, whereas if I draw an idealized seductive girl, she is a dehumanized sex object. I see no reason to attach such a dark context to a painting.


As for it being unrealistic, yes it is, but maybe that's not such a crime. A realistic depiction of a man in the morning would be with tousled hair, eye boogers and drool. Will women develop unrealistic standards if they keep seeing male Calvin Klein models who supposedly just woke up but they look like they just exited a makeup studio? I don't think people are that stupid, both men and women can tell apart reality from fantasy. If you watch Game of Thrones you won't be attracted to dragon-slaying men only, if you watch superhero films you won't be attracted to superheroes only and if you watch anime you won't be attracted to big-eyed people only.


What are your thoughts? My post got a little ranty but I'm not trying to be patronizing or change your views on anything, I just want to see what I've been missing.


Edit: I am not saying that all realistic art is boring. I am saying that if all art was realistic, it would be boring",1
How prevalent was anti-feminism during the early days of feminism?,"Nowadays, you'll often hear people say that feminism used to be good, but now it's gone too far, that we used to want equality, but now we want to have more power than men.

Cheaters Websites,"I‚Äôve recently discovered my husbands ex girlfriend (allegedly) created 23 different posts on about 9 different ‚Äúcheaters‚Äù websites. Everything she‚Äôs said is false. All the posts have my name and the city where I‚Äôm from. There are two different photos of me on some of the posts.

I had no idea these websites existed until I stumbled upon them when I googled myself. There are 1000s of people who are doxxed on there and the poster can say whatever they want, anonymously, without any legal repercussions (that I‚Äôm aware of). 

I was just wondering if any of you have had an experience of being doxxed on one of these websites, and if there is anything that can be done to take them down and hold the poster accountable.

Update: I just got a quote from a lawyer. 

‚ÄúPricing starts at $1,500 for one post and goes up depending on which sites you are on and how many posts you have. Based on the number of posts you provided, you are probably looking at a cost somewhere between $6,000-$9,000.‚Äù

So... I won‚Äôt be getting a lawyer. I figured that would happen but I wanted to see what my options were. 

Also some good information from the email: 

‚ÄúWhen a post becomes public on a shaming site it opens the content up to be ‚Äòscrapped‚Äô to other shaming sites. Scrapping takes place when other sites take content from one site and put it on multiple others as their own.

How to handle media that seems to objectify women?,"I'm still learning how to articulate my thoughts on this so please share your perspectives!

I noticed I get annoyed or triggered when I see commercials, movies, or shows that sexualize woman (ie: a seemingly wholesome anime movie, then suddenly random gratuitous panty shots up a girl's skirt; random women in bikinis just sitting on the side while the buff men move the plot forward in a cheesey action film; or when someone blatantly threatens to rape a woman). 

I'm bothered how pervasive it is in media and I don't want to feel so resentful about it. People tell me, ""then don't watch it."" But I can't just avoid media, because it's like I'm turning a blind eye and not addressing my gripes with it. I want to know how to change my .. mindset I guess? I want to not be so annoyed, or respond more calmly, or learn new ways to view the situation.

Should I (24M) eventually confess the worst thing I've done to any prospective partners?,"I'm currently single, and I've done some things about which I have great guilt. They may be considered criminal, but no one involved seems to care, and it's not like I'm expecting to ever have the police at my door because of these things.

Should I still tell any future partners about these things? I'm especially concerned that any of my partners should be provided with full transparency about who their sleeping with, so as not to deceive them into sex or a relationship (it just feels rapey). This may just be my anxiety talking, so feel free, anyone, to tell me so.

TL;DR! I've done some terrible things, but I'm not expecting any real consequences from them, and don't want to deceive any future partners into sex or relationships by not confessing these things.

EDIT: Thank you all for this input! I think the general idea is simple enough: if, in theory, my partner were to somehow learn about something I did and be put off by it, then I should disclose it at an appropriate time, no matter how slim a chance there may be. The reason being that healthy relationships are based on the ability to be honest and thus vulnerable about the good and bad parts of yourself with the other person.

Who is responsible Commercialization and Commodification of Women,"Women showing off their sexuality of their own volition and profiting from it if they wish is a sign of feminine empowerment, not objectification. 

That said, I definitely understand where many are coming from. Sexualization of women in contexts where it doesn‚Äôt really have anything to do with the main content is typically just disingenuous eye candy, lazy marketing designed to attract impulse buyers who only need to see a pretty face to get interested.

It‚Äôs rather complicated, because those women are excercising their right to profit off their sexuality, and those customers are buying exactly what those women are offering. They aren‚Äôt being exploited or coerced into giving more.

But then this perpetuates the mentality that women ARE commodities, which may lead those men to hurt real women who AREN‚ÄôT interested in selling their sexuality. But who‚Äôs responsibility is it to fix this? Capitalism? The Government? Women? Men?",1
What do you think about pre-college single-sex schools?,"I am a student who has studied in private all boys schools since elementary school. I am now a high school senior.

On the one hand, comparing to what I hear from my cousin and friends, there are no ""drama"" in an all boys' school. Gossips are really rare and there are no who's dating who going on at all. We also feel completely comfortable participating in activities having a traditionally skewed gender ratio, for example, I am very proud of being a member of the school's choir, while my friend in a co-ed school says they have real trouble recruiting boys into mixed choirs.

On the other hand, we lack the opportunity to learn what boundaries are, especially when it comes to interacting with the opposite sex. On rare occasions where the school organize activities with a sister school, most of us just sit together among ourselves and do not actively try to make new friends from the other school (same for the girls) as communication often becomes awkward and nervous. Another thing I notice is among us boys, when we know no female can hear us, we would laugh on sex and porn jokes that would probably make women offended or uncomfortable.

Why is sexual assault depicted in so many TV shows/Movies?,"I want to preface this by admitting that I am heavily triggered by topics surrounding sexual assault and harassment so I may just be overestimating but at least four of the shows I‚Äôve tried to watch have depicted SA in some way. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I literally feel the need to google search a show‚Äôs name and put ‚Äúrape‚Äù after it to see what comes up.

I think I‚Äôd feel so much differently about this if these depictions were done in ways that were focused on the survivor and their journey navigating the aftermath of the assault (I think the show ‚ÄúI May Destroy You‚Äù by Michaela Coel did a pretty good job at this). But often it feels like the scenes are just a way to advance the plot, show how ‚Äúevil‚Äù someone or something is and/or a way to add ‚Äúdepth‚Äù or backstory to a female character. 

While I recognize that depictions of sexual assault in media can start very necessary conversations about rape culture and how to recognize it, I feel like a lot of the shows I see are not doing it for that purpose. Am I being too critical?",1

I'm a woman who is terrible at and disinterested in household stuff. Fortunately, my partner loves to cook and decorate so he does all of that. We take turns with every other chore.

"Can one be a feminist if they don't ever use the term ""Latinx""?","This kind of irks at me inside because I just can't get comfortable with the term. Largely due to that I don't know a single person who identifies with it, but do know multiple Latino/a people who consider the term at best silly and eye-rollworthy and at worse offensive. It's also unpronouncable in Spanish and it feels uncomfortable to effectively tell Spanish speakers ""Your language is so dated and patriarchial, let us Anglophones tell you how to update it..."", this wouldn't be so much of an issue if most or at least a significant minority of Spanish speakers were open to the term, but every poll has shown that at most like 2-3% of Latinos in the US identify with it.

"Are these articles right or wrong in their claims, and if wrong, can you explain why that is?","As a woman, I don't understand why twitter is full of women talking about ""women naturally desiring strong men"" followed by bashing on ""feminine"" men?: [https://twitter.com/BritMartinez/status/1345522717789978626](https://twitter.com/BritMartinez/status/1345522717789978626)

The article linked sounds more off-putting to me: [https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/feminization-men-cheats-women-natural-desire-to-admire-strong-men/?fbclid=IwAR2popTJ9BBAiWkL8FNfLMjc81fMPQFnTFoBVgfYokrIHeGJ5LmaNs8MDto](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/feminization-men-cheats-women-natural-desire-to-admire-strong-men/?fbclid=IwAR2popTJ9BBAiWkL8FNfLMjc81fMPQFnTFoBVgfYokrIHeGJ5LmaNs8MDto)

In summary, the article mentions the Yin and Yang, claiming that women are innately ""feminine"", and men innately ""masculine"", that the ""feminine"" (woman) naturally desires and needs the ""masculine"" (man) to be complete (for ""femininity/womanhood"" to be fulfilled) just as much as the ""masculine"" (man) naturally desires and needs the ""feminine"" (woman) to be complete (for ""masculinity/manhood"" to be fulfilled)

""One can‚Äôt fulfill itself without the other"" it says. Indeed the Yin and Yang claims that all things exist as inseparable and contradictory opposites, which I'm guessing leads to the belief that: ""women are innately feminine, men are innately masculine, men can not be feminine, and women can not be masculine, or that would defy nature. And men (masculine) can not love or be in relationships with men (masculine), and women (feminine) can not love or be in relationships with women (feminine), because only the polar opposites can fulfill and complete each other, masculine (man) can not complement and complete the masculine (man), and feminine (woman) can not complement and complete the feminine (woman)""

&gt;The masculine needs the feminine just as much as the feminine needs the masculine. It‚Äôs an eternal truth as old as the concept of Yin and Yang itself. Tragically, today, we‚Äôre witnessing the extensive snuffing out of the masculine in our society. The Yang is being suppressed. When the modern feminists proclaim that gender is just a made-up ‚Äúconstruct,‚Äù understand that they‚Äôre essentially belittling the eons of human experience. The masculine-feminine duality isn‚Äôt a tool that the patriarchy uses to oppress women, despite what these anti-gender-roles activists allege. Rather, it‚Äôs an everlasting concept present in all of mankind, whether it be Eastern or Western or Native traditions.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Yin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity, and night time. Yang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity, and daytime. One can‚Äôt overrule the other. Womanhood and manhood have to work in tandem. It‚Äôs a symbol of the continuity of life itself.¬†

It links to another article when it reaches ""have to work in tandem"": [https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/men-and-women-are-complementary-this-benefits-couples-and-their-children/](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/men-and-women-are-complementary-this-benefits-couples-and-their-children/)

&gt;Men and women are unique beings created to complement each other. Biological differences enable men and women to live in love and harmony, forming a beautiful whole when they come together.

The rest is bashing ""feminine"" men, and saying that ""femininity"" comes with ""irrationality"" so men shouldn't be ""feminized"" because if they were to be so, they would become ""irrational"", basing their decisions on emotions ...

I'm not well-versed in these subjects, and thought I'd reach out to other women here who might know more.

Do you think those articles are right or wrong? And if they are wrong, can you explain your reasons?

Do you have any arguments against the things said in those articles?

I felt really terrible reading those articles because they sound misogynistic and homophobic? They seem to tell me that as a lesbian I am ""incomplete"" or a failure, because ""woman (feminine) can only be completed by a man (masculine), and vice versa""

I don't know, it's like all the homophobic things I've been told and I feel a bit sick :((",1

"Women with a better-than-average career/salary, are you repelled by men who have a lower social status/less money/a less ""blooming"" career than yourself? Do you always prefer men with an equal/higher social status?","Female hypergamy is sometimes said to be a social norm. The biggest stereotype is ""men are providers"", and ""a man must have his mission"" (you often hear that from dating coach and all sorts of gurus).

Evolutionary psychology sort of says that hypergamy makes sense (females prefer males who can feed their offsprings), but I'm still curious so I come to ask here. It's also important to remember that modern humans are not limited by natural laws (we got out of the food chain, food and shelter are more abundant, etc), so hypergamy should ""go away"" in modern civilization.

In a way, historically, if men had a higher social status than women, hypergamy might be still be correlation, not causation; meaning: an average woman preferring an average man, will mean that the man will still have a higher social status, but social status is not a factor, it's just because of a preexisting distribution of social status between men and women.

It's not a secret that social status and money cannot really determine how two people can be attracted to each other, since it depends on other things: a higher social status might also come from a better education, more love from their parents, a more stable social situation, more nurturing, etc.

When talking about how women are ""catching up"", It's often said that it's easier to automate jobs that are worked in majority by men, compared to job who are in majority worked by women (it's just a theory though).

Make up my own last name?,"Hey everyone. So something that‚Äôs never sat right with me is taking a mans last name. Considering that to him, the idea of taking the woman he loves last name is unfathomable, so why should it be fathomable for me to take his? There‚Äôs a (sorta) simple solution here, and that is to just not take his last name and to keep the one that was given to me at birth, my fathers last name; however, that‚Äôs still a bit unsettling to me lol. 

My father has been emotionally abusive to me ever since I was little, and recently I‚Äôve decided to completely cut him out of my life. He is all things I never want to be‚Äîan abuser, manipulator, narcissist, racists, sexist, homophobic‚Äîeverything bigot. Plus, there‚Äôs not much notability in having my family name in general.

The other issue is that since I have been thinking about it for a year, no name I‚Äôve come across has lit the light bulb.

"Thoughts about the gatekeeping of surgical sterilization (tubal ligation, etc.)?","Hi all, I've just been pondering this issue in my head for a few weeks now and I thought I'd bring it here just to see your thoughts.

Most of us have probably heard plenty of accounts from women who have sought out surgical sterilization and been told ""what if your husband someday wants children?"", ""only if you have kids already"", ""only if you're above a certain age"" etc., etc., etc.

It goes without saying that I don't think that's right.

At the same time I realize that, in general (i.e. with regard to *all* procedures, not just sterilization), doctors may feel an ethical responsibility (or maybe have an actual legal, written-in-stone responsibility ... I don't know) to steer patients toward the procedure that is least invasive, and/or which is least restrictive to the patient's future freedom of choice, if there is such an option and it is at least adequate relative to the more invasive/permanent one.

On one hand I do believe the amount of agency a patient has over their body should be maximized, and like the rest of you I believe that this is especially important with regard to reproductive autonomy. I think it's patronizing and disrespectful to act like you know better what a patient wants out of life than they do (unless there is some unusual factor, like the patient is experiencing mental health issues and abruptly starts expressing strong desires that are in contradiction to the ideals they consistently expressed when they were in better health).

A hypothetical: From what I understand, the failure rate of a hormonal IUD (3 in 1000) is about equivalent to the failure rate of tubal ligation (sources I'm reading seem to say between 1 in 1000 to 8 in 1000). Say you're a doctor and you have a patient *with no interfering health issues that would contraindicate a hormonal IUD*, but they come to you and seem to have their mind set on a tubal ligation. They have thought about it for a long time and express complete certainty that they will not want biological children in the future. 

You believe that a hormonal IUD would be just as adequate to serve the patient's purposes as a tubal ligation, and you feel a responsibility to choose the most conservative (as in low-risk, reversible etc.) adequate procedure wherever possible. You tell the patient that a hormonal IUD is about equal in reliability to tubal ligation, and they accept this, but this does not change their mind. The patient tells you that the more permanent procedure *feels* more effective and would grant them peace of mind (I have read accounts from people who desire surgery over an IUD for exactly this reason).

How could a doctor appropriately address this situation?

I understand that tubal ligation is reversible, but this is of course more invasive and I would imagine that, as a surgical procedure done under anaesthesia, it is significantly higher-risk than IUD removal (I don't know if it is, I'm just making an educated guess).

I don't think it's ever right to tell a patient who says they don't want children ""you'll probably change your mind someday"" or ""your husband might want children"" (gross), etc.. At the same time, people *do* change their minds about this unexpectedly for all sorts of reasons, and if a person *does* happen to change their mind, I would imagine that having to undergo the surgical reversal of a sterilization (which, as I understand it, is a complicated procedure you can't guarantee the success of) would cause significantly more distress than an IUD removal. 

In effect, one exercise of reproductive autonomy (in choosing surgical sterilization) poses a threat to the patient's future *ability* to make different choices. At the same time I acknowledge that the future limitation was accepted by the patient at the time of their initial choice, which makes it different from the limitation of choice *imposed* when doctors refuse to perform surgical sterilizations on (mostly women, of course) patients who don't meet X, Y, and Z standards.

How can this be accounted for while, at the same time, maximizing patients' bodily and medical autonomy? You could say that it is ultimately the patient's responsibility to account for the potential consequences of the choice they're making, but I could see where this line of thought could set a dangerous precedent in medical ethics (especially with regard to other elective procedures) unless it was articulated very carefully.

Bear in mind that I don't have much formal knowledge about medical ethics and I don't know what conventions and protocols might already be in place to address this issue.

I haven't come to much of a conclusion in my consideration of this issue, so I'd like to hear your thoughts. Thanks for reading and I hope I've articulated this well.",1

Do you look down on people who are unfazed or even flattered by unsolicited sexual acts from others?,"If you notice a stranger walking up to someone and make lewd comments to them, **but** that person seems to enjoy the attention, do you think ""they must be damaged if they enjoy this attention"", or ""if they enjoyed it then they enjoyed it; to each their own""?

For instance in social environments I've had my ass grabbed as a joke unprompted by friends and acquaintances of both genders (without prior recognition of consent between us), and I have mostly felt either unfazed, flattered or in some cases I even find it funny. One of my closer friends has witnessed this and told me that ""something is wrong with me"" if I don't think they're creeps or bad people for doing that to me, and even worse, that I must have had a traumatic experience which conditioned me to be okay with this. And I think that this is a rather invalidating thing to say.

Now, only people I know personally have done that to me. Strangers have never done that, and in that case I would feel violated. But obviously there exists people out there who enjoy that unprompted behavior even from strangers. And there are people who would condone much more than an unprompted ass slap or someone making sexual comments. Do you think these people are ""damaged""  or do you think of it more as ""you do you""?

And keep in mind I'm NOT asking what you think of the people doing these things (""perpetrators""), so this discussion isn't about that. I'm well aware of the idea that they are still problematic even if the other person doesn't mind. Right now I'm focusing entirely on the people to whom the ""perpetrators"" are doing these unsolicited sexual acts, rather than the perpetrators themselves.",1

How to propose an idea to a group that is normally very religious or conservative?,"Hello all

As it is I'm looking for alternate ways to approach certain people in the conservative area I live in. It has a minimal and decreasing number of young people. As it is I don't plan on staying here forever. But, I kind of want to get people to thing if it comes to a conversation. As for some reason it often does the few times I do go out.

My main strategy is asking peoples thoughts on things and gently proposing ideas from a different perspective. Often those who are listening or interested will put some thought into it. I'm just curious for alternate ideas if someone gets really worked up or hostile about it. Having someone feel like they're getting attacked doesn't help the situation.",1
Why do straight (usually cis) women get away with fetishizing gay/bi men?,"I seriously do not get it, from those creepy yaoi fangirls to when you see the results on sites like pornhub (www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna894266) straight women just get away in any single setting with creepy fetishizing of gay/bi men, and nobody seems to take this seriously. Fetishizing gay people of any gender is wrong, yet there's this weird acceptance with straight women fetishizing gay men in society.

There's one argument that I've heard which is that straight erotica is usually centered around straight men and not women, so women use MLM erotica...but isnt that just trying to justify fetishization? Why not just make separate erotica centered around straight women than having to fetishize gay/bi men as a result.

Its not right that gay/bi men have to take a risk of getting fetishized by straight women, just because straight erotica is directed at straight men.",1
Seeking perspective on equality,"Feminism is a contentious topic where I live. It seems that many people have differing ideas as to what feminism is, what it's about, its goals, and its focus.

So here's what I want to know: What actually is feminism? I've heard from many that it was a movement for better treatment of women that evolved into a movement for inclusivity and equality for all. I've done quite a bit of reading, everything from the dictionary definition to various bloggers and self-proclaimed philosophers.

I make no opinions on those, as I'm more interested in what you, the redditors and lurkers of /r/AskFeminists have to say on this topic.

1. Do you believe it's a movement for equality for all?
2. Do you believe that the movement is focused on any particular goals?
3. Do you believe it is achieving what it set out to do? If so, how so? If not, why not?
4. How do you feel about the portrayal of the feminist movement by the mass media?
5. what do you think are necessary or beneficial qualities of a feminist or those who wish to align themselves with feminist thought patterns?
6. What do you think a person could do today that would be a good start in, for example, getting people to question their problematic beliefs and start a wave of questioning and change within themselves and those around them? 
7. What do people do that you think are harmful to the movement and why do you think such things are harmful?
8. Do you have any thoughts as to what might be good, bad, needs reinforcement, or needs improvement for the sake of the movement?

I want to hear your opinions, I wish to better understand my fellow human beings as well as learn and grow from your experiences. I cannot temper my thoughts, ideas, and beliefs in a vacuum.

Please enlighten me.

\[EDIT\]: In case you're overwhelmed, please feel free to pick any set of questions or even answer all of 'em if you feel like it. You don't have to answer all at once and I'd value your opinion even if it's on only one of the many topics I wish to gain perspective on. Any insight, whether it's to a question on this list or a subject that you feel needs to be heard is valuable.

So pick a topic, any topic within the scope of this post, I'd love to hear what you have to say.

How and why you think are just as important as the content of your thoughts.

Serious question from a guy who‚Äôs from a mixed race family about his little sister.,"Hey people, so I never thought I would find myself on a feminist page as I‚Äôm not very political but I have a genuine question concerning my little sister. 

My family is biracial and I look very white like my mother but my sister is dark skinned. Well recently she started dating this guy and when talking to my female friend she made the comment ‚Äúof course your sister had to date the only black guy in school.‚Äù 

The comment seemed innocent but it really rubbed me the wrong way. I have heard other comments such as ‚Äúguess she wanted to be with one of her own‚Äù. These are really bothering me because I have grown up with my sister and I know for fact that she chose the man she‚Äôs with because he‚Äôs an awesome guy and when I see them interacting he really knows how to connect with her. She didn‚Äôt choose him because he looked like her, my sister is a deep and intuitive person. 

I guess now that I‚Äôm older I‚Äôm having to confront the fact that society sees her and her decisions as that of a ‚Äúblack girl‚Äù and not as her own. 

How can I be there for her and what is a good way to respond to these ridiculous statements so I can defend my little sister. 

I love her and I hate seeing the box society tries to put her decisions into. Idk, I know this a long rant/question but I‚Äôm at a loss here. 

I grew up with her and now that she‚Äôs older I hate seeing people assume she‚Äôs a certain way because she‚Äôs a woman or because she‚Äôs black or both and If anyone here has seen or experienced the same thing, what are some good ways to shut down negative comments and ignorance without accusing the other of intentionally being rude/mean.",1

'Yeah but actually...' from Men when talking about sexual abuse of children (Trigger Warning!!!),"I think I need help here. 

Recently I have listened to the podcast 'Lolita' (tw: child sexual abuse, rape, grooming, violence) that discusses the original text of the book by Nabokov and how pop culture somehow twisted it into this forbidden love story and often frames Dolores as the seductress that knew what she wanted and so on.

I talked to my friends about it to get their opinion on it, and what just stands out to me is that every woman just simply agrees that an adult man and a child of 12 can not have a sexual and romantic relationship and that there's basically no grey area, neither in the book (that gives us the narrative of a pedophile who frames the grooming of a child in a certain light to sound less incriminating) nor in real life. It's abuse, it's rape, it's not morally debatable even if the child would later say (which Dolores did not!) that she has not been coerced etc

Now, a significant number of the men I talked to (3 out of 5 to be precise), all of whom I consider great people and all self-identified feminists, agreed overall, but started to do the whole 'yeah but' thing. Yeah but what did she feel, maybe she was alright with it, yeah but if she was slightly older, yeah but what if she was mature for her age etc.. In common they had that there seemed to be this assumption that, theoretically, a child could consent if the stars aligned or whatever. Now, I don't know how many 12 year olds people have been around, but honestly, am I just completely wrong here when I say that HARD NO, a 12 year old, even if they themselves at the time believe that it was consensual (something that I personally have never even heard of, and seems to be a rather absurd hypothetical situation in lights of the thousands and thousands of child abuse cases), CAN NOT give informed consent to sex with an adult, never mind to a relationship?

There has even been an instance where I wasn't even sure what we were talking about anymore or what exactly he was saying, just that there was a need for a 'but' there that just wouldn't go away.

I'm not sure if I just am very very biased, coming from a position of a woman who has been sexually harassed by a much, much older man that I trusted when I was 14, and from the position of a therapist who sees so many women who have gone through sexual abuse by an adult when they were kids. Maybe I'm not seeing the 'but' here. 

So yeah, I guess what I'm asking for is: have you made similar experiences with men on this topic and if yes, why do you think that is? Also, if you think I'm too undifferentiated and need to consider a different angle that I'm just not seeing, feel free to point it out.

Feminism &amp; Sexism activists in my social media bubble,"Update

Since I won't check reddit much more this evening: Thank you all so much for your responses and perspectives. I was searching for a place where I can have a healthy conversation about this topic and my feelings right now. My wife and I talked so much the last hours, but in the end, we have a similar idea about it, since we spent the last years together and gathered the same experiences. 

This here helped me a lot to get a better view for the bigger picture. I am more aware of my responsibility in my privileged life. 

Therefore: You people are amazing &lt;3 hope you get well, healthy and happy into 2021!



Original Post:

Hello everyone,

I hope this is the right subredit for this. In case not, feel free to advice me another one more suitable :) thank you

I really need your help on this. I was thinking about this all night long.

This is a very special and difficult topic for me. I use a throwaway account since I am highly insecure when it comes to the correct phrasing and possible negative reactions. Moreover, English isn‚Äôt my primary language, so apologize for grammar or spelling mistakes.

**tl;dr: Within my social media bubble, I get increasingly hurt by messages (mostly tweets) that are phrased very radically. There is no way to have a healthy and constructive conversation, since I am a man and therefore ‚Äúmansplaining‚Äù. By now I tend to think that I should accept this, swallow my hurt feelings and accept, that the overall topic is so important, that my hurt feelings less important.**

I am a man in my early thirties, and I am CEO of a company in social media marketing (thus making this topic extra important but also extra explosive). I am also married to a wonderful wife and we have a 3-year-old son. We are a couple for almost 14 years now and know each other for 17 years.

The reason I mention this is that in both roles of my life, I am trying to regularly reflect on my decisions and my own thoughts. On whether there is some underlying aspect of sexism, leading me to certain impressions or ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù decisions. I have the luxury of having a wife and colleagues who let me discuss this topic and therefore evaluate the situations. Sexism, like many other topics in our society, are moving an evolving which is why I think it is important to talk and discuss about them continuously. In my opinion, this is the foundation of change: A healthy, inviting and constructive atmosphere in order to discuss and evolve.

Switching over to my actual topic: My social media bubble is currently filled with mostly women who bring up the topic of feminism and sexism. Bringing these topics to the frontline of social discussion is important and I support it as much as I can with retweets and comments and shares among my friends.

At the same time, I see more and more posts that I agree with in their essence, but not in their phrasing. Just one example (rephrased the original tweet to make an easier example):

**‚ÄúOMG men in relations who flirt with other women are so disgusting. They should learn to treat their girlfriends with respect. Girls, get up and fight!‚Äù**

Tweets like this provoke a huge social media feedback and therefore reach.

Lying and betraying a partner (or any human) is bad. I agree. And women should stand up to such a behavior. But this isn‚Äôt the message of this tweet.

My wife and I are fine with the other person flirting with others. We openly talk about sexual desires and boundaries. So while the intention of this tweet is fine, I am put in the same box with people with bad intent. There are multiple tweets that go in the same direction.

I tried to reason with the person tweeting this per DM. I said that its not about the idea and message but about the phrasing that should be differentiated, since not all men are acting like this.

The response was, a link to this article plus a big text about why it was presumptuous to message her about her tweet, since she is an activist in this topic and way better informed and educated than I probably am.

[https://medium.com/@KirstyStricklan/why-men-should-stop-saying-notallmen-immediately-f657e244f7a1](https://medium.com/@KirstyStricklan/why-men-should-stop-saying-notallmen-immediately-f657e244f7a1)

I pulled back asap, apologized for the impression I made, thanked her long message (she explained her backstory) and wished her a good evening.

I agree, that it was presumptuous to confront her with my opinion, without her asking. Additionally, even though I think her reaction was highly defensive and destructive for every healthy discussion, she probably usually has discussions like this in a way more hostile environment, leading to her always having her defense up and running for every man ‚Äúattacking‚Äù her.

But in the end, I had another two thoughts:

1. I learned that in topics like racism, sexism aso. it isn‚Äôt about the senders intent, but about how it is received. This is why, when someone confronts one with something that might be received sexist or racist, one should (constructively) converse (especially when it is clear, that there was no bad intent), reflect and adjust ones thinking and acting.However, in the current case, I am not allowed to be the receiver who is hurt by this message. On the contrary. An article like the one above tells me, the receiver, that I am wrong. And the digital society even created the word ‚Äúmansplaining‚Äù, to not only take away my right to feel hurt, but to actively make it something bad.
2. As stated in my tl;dr: I don‚Äôt define myself by this stuff on social media. I can be hurt but it won‚Äôt affect me that much. As mentioned, tweets like the one above create a high reach by high interaction rates and therefore push the topic of feminism more and more in the spotlight. Based on the phrase ‚Äúthe end justifies the means‚Äù, I would currently tend to accepting that feminism and sexism currently is no topic I can participate in, but that the current dynamic will create awareness for the topic ‚Äì even if it is by creating insecurity

There are many more thoughts and layers I have with this topic but this would make this thread even longer and more confusing.

I would like to have your thoughts on this. Do you make similar experiences on social media? Should I act differently? In all honesty: I really want to learn and understand. And I can do that best by conversing with others.

Thank you very much for your time an effort. It is much appreciated &lt;3",1

Should affirmative action in Australia be rolled back in light of the findings of the 2016 Australian Beta report?,"The prominent feminist narrative that I often hear about is that women are being turned away from job opportunities particularly by men. So apparently, the Australian government in 2016 to simultaneously expose and rectify this problem with nameless resumes. By using nameless resumes and making the recruitment process completely gender-blind, they wanted to ensure that hiring outcomes will be more equitable and that women will no longer have to be judged by anything else other than their merit. They ran a trial to examine the results and found that:

*""The trial found assigning a male name to a candidate made them 3.2 per cent less likely to get a job interview.*

*Adding a woman's name to a CV made the candidate 2.9 per cent more likely to get a foot in the door.""*

Apparently making the recruitment process fair and impartial leads to less women being hired than before.

The report just redefines this information that shows discrimination towards men as evidence that affirmative action is working and recommends keeping names on resumes.

*Overall, the results indicate the need for caution when moving towards ‚Äôblind‚Äô recruitment processes in the APS, as de-identification may frustrate efforts aimed at promoting diversity.*

But since it's quite obvious that what the report inadvertently just demonstrated is that affirmative action in Australia is indistinguishable from discrimination, should affirmative action be rolled back so that hiring outcomes aren't biased towards women?

Thoughts on Perrault's Bluebeard,"Hi r/Feminism,

Bluebeard by Charles Perrault is my very favourite fairy tale. If you don't know it, here is the [wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebeard) to it. Considering most fairy tales, Bluebeard could be termed a 'feminist' (before the term existed) tale of a woman who kills (!) and escapes from her male oppressor.

&gt;While some scholars interpret the Bluebeard story as a fable preaching obedience to wives (as [Perrault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Perrault)'s moral suggests), [folklorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklorist) [Maria Tatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Tatar) has suggested that the tale encourages women not to unquestioningly follow patriarchal rules. Women breaking men's rules in the fairy tale can be seen as a metaphor for women breaking society's rules and being punished for their transgression.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebeard#cite_note-12) The key can be seen as a sign of disobedience or transgression; it can also be seen as a sign that one should not trust their husband.

If you have come across this tale previously (or just now through this post) what are your thoughts on the tale? Do you know other fairy tales/myths which give the female protagonist agency &amp; power?

EDIT: It's *really* surprising that Bluebeard has never been made into a Disney film.",1

But these posts are spread around by anti-feminists, they dont care about that person at all, its just an attack. And people even believe the fake news they spread about these type of posts. I checked a lot of posts like these and most of them turns out to be fake. And people believe them.

And what does more is that they say how it ruins the man's life and yeah they are right. But as a survivor of rape myself, it makes me mad and I know that is wrong. I think how most of the women never even report. And the ones that do, they dont really have a life after that. They will be called liars and whatnot for the rest of their lives. And the trauma it will leave... And how only just a few ever get justice and can live without much problems and thats good. And the male rape victims...they face the same stuff too coz of how men are not raped and those beliefs... So I just needed to know what would be the best way to tell people.

 If this post is confusing or anything, please let me know I will delete it. I dont think I even asked a valid question or something like that. Sorry. (Please moderators, kf this post was not enough or didnt make sense or anything like that, please dont block me, just tell me I will delete it)",1
How would the world change if clothing and beauty products didn't exist?,"This question is a bit out there so please forgive me.

Imagine you wake up tomorrow to find that all the clothing, beauty products, and other adornments have disappeared from the world, never to be remade. Instead of applying makeup in the morning, billions of women to out into the world baring the face they woke up with no matter the situation. Instead of putting together outfits for the day, we live our lives in bare feet and unclothed bodies, lacking jewelry or hair products as well.

Aside from having to deal with cold weather (just pretend everyone adapts to this), how would society change? How would the world react to these changes, and how would you deal with them personally?",1
Antifeminist analogy analysis,"I‚Äôve been talking with this guy about feminism. He‚Äôs a antifeminist (aka a bigot).

He sent me this analogy for feminism whenever i said that feminism does support mens issues.

‚ÄúIt's the classic motte and bailey tactic (medieval castle analogy).
The bailey is the part of the castle where most of the actual work is done. It's several acres, filled with people working at various tasks--weaving, brewing, blacksmithing, tending livestock, etc. There will be a wall around it, but because of the large circumference of the perimeter, it is hard to defend.
The motte is a tower, set on high ground, with strong fortifications that can resist attack.
When enemies arrive, the people in the bailey retreat to the safety of the motte.
Feminists, while in the bailey, perform the work of producing and pushing anti-male ideas. These ideas are hard to defend.
Then the enemy arrives, and points to what's going on in the feminist bailey.
At which point, all the feminists in the bailey retreat to the motte and start shouting the easier to defend idea that, ""feminism is just about gender equality! Look it up in the dictionary! Pay no attention to what people were doing in the bailey--those people aren't even real feminists!""
Black Lives Matter use this ploy, too. Their bailey is filled with anti-capitalism, a plainly stated intent to ""disrupt"" the allegedly white supremacist ""nuclear family structure"", demands to abolish the police, and other extremely radical and difficult to defend ideas.
When anyone calls them on the above, they retreat to their motte, wherein they characterize the criticism as a rejection of the defensible (and pretty much universally agreed upon) idea that black lives matter as much as white lives.
It's rhetorical chicanery, but it works on low-information people.‚Äù

Financial independence of homemakers,"I come from a conservative developing country where the major feminist issues are domestic violence and economical emancipation of women. So the idea of an adult without any independent source of income (may it be via employment or social welfare) seems scary to me.

Should lookism/desirability politics be taken more seriously as its own intersection? Should we consider ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù the way we consider other privileges?,"I have ofc seen these concepts discussed, yet not as heavily as other intersections.  Attraction bias, as well, isn‚Äôt considered a social justice issue in the way other biases/prejudices are.  Should it really be normalized to call people ‚Äúugly‚Äù as an insult, whether or not a person is problematic or a member of another privileged group?

Beauty standards are mostly discussed within the contexts of racism/Eurocentricity and misogyny.  I personally feel reducing it to those alone is an oversimplification (because members of privileged groups can *not* fit certain beauty standards and be subject to attraction biases), hence my question on recognizing it as it‚Äôs own intersection.

Edit:  I think to narrow such a broad discussion, we could discuss if shaming people for being ‚Äúugly‚Äù should be condemned just as much as say, body shaming someone.  Or why judging people by looks is normalized and should it continue to be? There seems to be good discussion already on the consequences of such judgement, and how severe they are.",1
Why are children always named after men?,"I've noticed how common it is for sons to be named after fathers, grandfathers, and other notable people in their family.

I'm not sure if this is a feminist issue, but I thought it would be interesting to bring up here. I'm not really into the idea of naming people after each other since my culture doesn't practice that, but I still find it odd how they're never named after women.",1

Should all social media have stricter verification?,"With all the Pornhub controversy going on, I thought this would be an interesting discussion to start.

It seems like a lot of the media focuses mostly on porn websites when there are much higher numbers of child sexual abuse content being posted on Facebook and other social media (Facebook has close to 100 million cases, and Pornhub had around 100 before they deleted all unverified content). Even on GoneWild subreddits I find myself wondering if some of the women (and other genders to a lesser extent) are even over 18, since this site doesn't require age verification. After seeing how Pornhub made the change to verification as a requirement, it made me think about how other platforms can implement this too. All sex worker platforms such as OnlyFans and ManyVids already required this, but why not apply it to general social media because of how many people lie about their age and all?

I feel like this wouldn't cause too much backlash either; I know Tinder currently has optional face verification but most people don't mind going through with it because of how simple the process is. Some people might have trust issues in regards to showing ID though, so I can see that being a problem.

However I'd love to hear what you guys think, and it's relevant to gender inequality because of how often the victims of these issues are young girls.",1
Does feminism really need Hollywood and A-list celebrities?,"I'm trying to read the signs and it seems to me that Hollywood and celebrities on the whole are losing relevance every year. It seems to be a clear trend.

Throughout the 2010's I've certainly seen more movies that tried to include feminism and more diverse representation but the format feels super old. The messages and ideas, okay sometimes but often very dumbed down and chronically behind discussions going on in social media. A lot of the time it feels like they are chasing ghosts, address problems to a show that's actually mostly dead already. Do gender switched remake movies even matter at all? 

I got concerned about how there's this new Wonder Woman movie which includes a man who's body is invaded by the spirit of WW's dead boyfriend and used for sex. So clearly, yet another wannabe progressive blockbuster that pollutes it's own intentions through glaring incompetence.

But then I thought, how many will even watch this movie? How many of those watching will do so without simultaneously fidgeting with their phones?  Superhero movies and nostalgia-trains seem to still have some hold on the Gen-X audience, but that interest is waning fast too. Nothing much else is being created.  

As for celebrities, it seems less and less people care or even listens to what they have to say anymore. Not in the pandemic, that's for sure. It's evident when we see how a couple of virologists over the world now enjoy positions as superstars. Something that couldn't happen in the past when that spotlight was reserved for actors. 

My question is, does it even matter? Does the death of movie mass entertainment and that collective culture impact feminism in any way? If so, is it in a good or bad way?",1

"My girlfriend is sexist, what can I do?","Me (27m)  and my girlfriend (26f) have been together for almost a year now, but recently something about her world view has started to cause conflict. My grlfriend is a Ukrainian immigrant who was raised in an extremely religiously conservative family and community with strict gender roles. As and teenager and an adult, she got away from it, moved on an evolved her perspective. The problem is, when it comes to issues of gender, it became uneven. What I mean by that is she doesn't apply traditional gender roles to men, really at all, and is incredibly progressive in that sense, but she still applies strong gender roles to women. She doesn't openly hate women, but deep down I know she is conflicted over some of those ideas that were taught to her, and it corrupts her judgment and leads to prejudice and at times self hatred.

 The majority of her friends are male, and she while she usually says that's just because she gets along with them better in general, she has admitted to be at times that it's because she doesn't usually trust women, even with female friends she has, she very obviously doesn't open up to them as much. She is also very quick to assume the worst of women in general, whereas she tends to give men the benefit of the doubt, and makes excuses for their behavior, something she basically never does with her women friends. Although she never admits it, I've noticed she doesn't like going to professionals who are women, I've seen her avoid female doctors, driver instructors, and lawyers. Although she has a sexually progressive outlook in theory, and is against marriage for personal reasons, I've frequently caught her slut shaming other women, and even herself. She's admitted to me before that she feels bad about having a sex life before she met me, even though she knows that doesn't make sense and I've made it abundantly clear that I don't have even the slightest issue with it and dislike the idea of chastity for my own personal reasons. 

I had noticed this all before, and addressed it a few times, but it had never become a real issue. I love her deeply, and I know trying to change someone you love is never a good idea, and also I understand that she has lived a life that makes breaking these perceptions incredibly difficult. In addition to the ""values"" she was raised with, she was abused by bother her mother and sister growing up. However, the other night things came to a head, and we finally got into an actual argument. She was telling me about how one of her guy friends (who is a card caring misogynist and serial cheater) broke up with his most recent girlfriend over, shockingly, cheating. She was defending him by saying that while cheating is bad, the women he's with should be smarter and know better. This was an especially glaring double standard since she found out one of her girlfriends was cheating on their boyfriend about a month ago, and they are still barely talking because she found that so morally objectable. During this argument, she openly admitted that she finds women cheating worse than men, which absolutely shocked me. 

I truly to love her deeply, but I just don't know how to feel. It's such a bizzare situation to feel so morally opposed to the views of your significant other. At the end of the day, I truly want what's best for her, and I believe the sexist views she holds aren't just social harmful, but also hurt her, because I've seen how she at times shames herself with them. I'm just not sure what to do.",1
"Should straight women stop calling each other ""Girlfriend""?","I was watching a Strange Aeons video (highly recommend this channel to every feminist) and she was talking about how her romantic relationships with women often aren't taken seriously. They get seen as best friends or even sisters, even when introducing each other as girlfriends (some people even ask, ""Like girl friend or girlfriend girlfriend?""). I checked the comment section and a lot of women seemed to have a common struggle when discussing relationships with parents and such. There were lots of complaints about how casual women can be when calling platonic friends ""girlfriends"", and it really made me think.

I've always found out odd when people call their friends ""Girlfriends"", because I'd never refer to buds as boyfriends. However, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this issue!",1
Why do you guys defend the child support system?,"Edit: The whole point of this post was so people wouldn't repeat the same arguments I already saw in past threads on this subreddit. Before you make an argument against one of the points in this post please read further down the post and see if I already responded to that argument.
____
I know questions about child support have been asked before, but none of the existing arguments made were convincing to me.

The main argument in favor of biological fathers paying child support is that without this system, the mother wouldn't have money to raise a child. That is, the law exists to support the child, not the wishes of the parents.

Well, public money can support the child instead, which wouldn't harm the mother or the child in any way. But wouldn't this be unfair, since the burden of paying shouldn't be put on the taxpayers? Well, if paying slightly more in taxes is such an unfair burden to the public, then it definitely isn't fair to put all the financial strain on the biological father.

That is, I think parenthood is a social construct; there's no reason a man should be considered a child's father (outside of a biological sense) just because he shares half of the child's DNA. Which why I assume it would be agreed that rape victims and sperm donors should not pay child support. But there are already documented instances of rape victims being forced to pay child support to their rapists.

The only way to avoid having male rape victims responsible for child support as the logical conclusion of the argument is to make an implicit underlying argument: that a man who has sex voluntarily is responsible for the child, and therefore deserves to pay child support. Which implies that when someone performs an activity carrying a risk of something bad happening, they're always responsible and to blame when the bad thing happens. I disagree with this.

If someone got into a car accident, we don't say they had it coming because they chose to drive a car in the first place despite being aware of the risks. In the same way, if a child is accidentally conceived even when both partners were using contraception, neither should be seen as responsible for the child.

Which is why I don't like the arguments made in this subreddit defending the child support system. To me it seems like the points typically made that ""it's only for the benefit for the child"" are disingenuous, and it's really just about punishing and blaming men for having sex using pro-life logic. I don't like that.

The child support system seems blatantly unfair to me. Women have a choice on whether or not they are considered a parent by the legal system, but men don't. The argument to this is that abortion is risky and can be a difficult choice. But it's better than not having a choice at all. And ideally a woman would be able to opt out of parenthood as well without getting an abortion. That seems much fairer than the current system, where one parent can opt out but the other cannot.

What are some arguments against this?",1
Thoughts around ‚Äúage appropriate‚Äù toys that seem... sexualized?,"So, LOL Dolls. My niece asked for these for Christmas. I didn‚Äôt get her one because they seem like dolls a pedophile would create as a means to help groom young children. My sister did get her daughter one of the dolls but is uncomfortable with it and is debating ‚Äúlosing‚Äù the doll.

I‚Äôm hoping I could get some input to help me organize my thoughts around these dolls, and maybe help me with how to talk to my sister about these dolls. I‚Äôm not going to offer her unsolicited advice - she‚Äôs genuinely conflicted about these dolls.

On the one hand, she doesn‚Äôt want her daughter to feel shamed for liking these dolls or to feel like it‚Äôs wrong for women to dress a certain way. On the other hand, these dolls are dressed in lingerie and that seems not age appropriate for a five year old. There was a line of the dolls that had lingerie appear when they were run under water. It just seems like it‚Äôs grooming children to dress sexy (not that it‚Äôs wrong for adult women to dress sexy, but even if these were dolls targeted at adult women, I don‚Äôt feel like these dolls are dressed in a ‚Äúyou‚Äôll feel sexy‚Äù kind of way, but more in a ‚Äúboys will think you‚Äôre sexy‚Äù kind of way). These dolls are for ages 5+.

I tried hunting around here to see if any discussion around these dolls came up previously and couldn‚Äôt find anything. I did find [this post on trashy](https://www.reddit.com/r/trashy/comments/ac2ql4/my_3_year_olds_lol_surprise_doll_she_got_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) on a reddit wide search, which I‚Äôve linked just so people can see what these dolls look like.

I really can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm being too uptight in thinking these dolls seem inappropriate for children, or if it‚Äôs probably not a good idea to give these to my niece.",1
What do you think about consent and a definition of rape regarding a problematic plot from later Wonder Woman 1984 film?(Spoiler),"The problem is that if the gender is swapped with Superman doing the same like wonder man, there will be a major outcry. The plot is that her death boyfriend come back into another man's body through some magic. Both main characters know that and have sex later.Worse thing is that the movie doesnt dive deeper into moral implications of that and brush off like nothing.
The  body owner come back later and doesnt know about anything, and diana doesnt show any remorse for that specific problem.
The movie is supposed to be a woman empowering one and also directed and written by a quite outspoken female director. Also, many in social media are saying like the guy should be grateful to be f#$ked by a literal goddess. I think this describes one of the major problem of society and also indirectly encouraging toxic masculanity like having sex is always a win for men.",1

She's only a ""submissive"" female character/female character without agency for around five or ten minutes of screen time. Then, she starts gradually gaining agency and assertiveness throughout the course of the movie and not letting the man who created her tell her what to do at all.  I get that some people would say that her being saved by a guy was supposed to send a message to the audience about how she shouldn't have became all independent and stopped listening to what the guy who created her had to say but after she gets ""repaired"" by him and given a new body, she goes right back to being a character with a ton of agency again who doesn't listen to what he has to say. 

Also, she does end up having to save her boyfriend in a way that does look like a gender reversal when it happens. In addition, I think it's kind of weird that anti-feminists love this movie so much since there's literally a scene when Alita beats up an entire room full of ""hunter warrior"" men which is the exact kind of thing that anti-feminists constantly complain about.",1

I Learn Something Very Valuable(At Least For Me) Today.,"As a heterosexual male... I have been trying to be aware and supportive of pro-women movements around the world.

Even if my girlfriend was not aware or wanted to see it, I would tell her. We watched the Birds of Prey movie... she didn‚Äôt enjoy it and neither did I. The story for me was bland, but the one thing the rubbed me the wrong way was the... (don‚Äôt know how to say it without sounding a dick or controversial, but here it goes) ‚Äúhate for men‚Äù. That‚Äôs the best way I can say it without going too deep. I saw it did not enjoy it but didn‚Äôt go out of my way to hate on it. 
NOW... fast forward to today after watching Wonder Woman 84, and I ended up with that same feeling. I sat down quietly and started to think about it. I came to the conclusion that those type of movies are the female equivalent to the testosterone filled action movies that have been out since the mid 70s. Dumb/fun movies with some sort of sexualization of women. WW84 made me see how women might‚Äôve felt when watching these type of movies.

If you say that it is because a person might not be fully informed about flu vaccine, it can also extend to you might not know the attributes of the product being sold, you don't know if you like the food until you try it, or you don't know if you like the sex act until you do it.

"Globally, the alt-right have been targeting Asian women on the dating market. What can we do about it?","There is this strange phenomenon which the supposedly racist, white alt-right dudes are obsessed with Asian women, and they have some very strange, fucked up ideas about us. If you don't know what I'm talking about, here's a good introduction from NYT: 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/opinion/sunday/alt-right-asian-fetish.html

I'm a first generation Chinese immigrant residing in US. Lately someone built an online community for Chinese female immigrants all over the world. Ideologically, this community skew highly educated feminists.

Someone in US posted about her experience of meeting an alt-right dude on a dating app, she discribed how she felt disgusted and terrified by the guy on their first date in person, and her thread exploded. 

Young Chinese women from all over the north america and europe shared similar experiences. We talked about strategies for identifying and dealing with these creepy dudes at length.

We started to realize this isn't some random bad luck but a global phenomenon. These dudes are intentionally approaching asian women. I've briefly looked into white supremacist communities out of curiosity. The Asian fetish and the mental gymnastics have been around for a while. I'm not surprised at all to see these Chinese women felt the real world impact. 

It's just the first time Chinese women start to actually talk about it, our conversation is both infuriating and fascinating.

Now we want to take actions to protect ourselves against racist and misogynist dudes. We want raise awareness and educate each others. We want to share our first-hand experiences with the broad Asian and feminist communities. We want to tell our side of the story and how we felt in these situations. We want our voices heard on this matter.

I'm thinking of taking this discussion to journalists. What media shall I reach out to? The ladies don't mind translate their posts into english. But before putting in all the work,  I want to find some media committed to publish them. Ideally they should have someone who can read Chinese.

Attacks towards white women in feminism groups.,"For the past few year, I notice a lot of attacks towards white women. specifically in liberal groups. the karen slur. becky, susan...

i also notice of a tendency of people calling white women privileged. or that white women are partially to blame for trumps presidency (despite more wm voting for trump), people bringing the 53% statistic of ww voting for trump (it was 47 in reality) people even blame white women for white supremacy. Despite white women not having mucb control under wm's leadership.

What aren't we saying about setting boundaries in relationships?,"This goes for every type of relationship. Workplace, friendships, parental, and romantic. It's come to my attention lately that there are a lot of people in the world who have no concept of how to set boundaries, or even what healthy boundaries are. People will invade their space, touch others, or ignore their words and feelings by dismissing or belittling them. It's sad and scary to think people are still believing that this is okay.

Given, relationships are all different. There are still some basics that should be covered. School isn't something that has done a good job educating people about relationships, so sometimes people only have familial relationships to start learning from. If they have a bad home environment there are some things that they might think are normal.

There are a lot of topics to touch on, however, the biggest I feel would be boundary setting and what is and isn't acceptable. Gaining joy, acceptance, and a feeling of safety are what many hope to get out of a relationship. Even if no one is perfect it doesn't take much to stop and listen to what someone you care about is saying. So it's alarming when a person mentions that they feel lonely, ignored, or scared in a relationship. Should a person stretch themselves too thin it can be very draining.

So, where would be a good place to start in learning to set boundaries? Ideally, this is something that people should learn from their parents. Not everyone will get this though. The line 'my house, my rules' comes to mind. People can make their own rules should someone be living with them. However, it doesn't make it right to take away the freedom and autonomy of another. It often leads to people being stuck in abusive situations.

Extending on this, should someone grow up in a bad situation it might continue on in friendships and relationships. Picking on a spouse or being treated poorly by a spouse and thinking that these things are normal and okay. Often times even in media it'll rear its ugly head. There are so many jokes about a spouse being trapped or chained down. This shouldn't be a normal feeling.

People can also be extremely possessive or draining on friends. Some people need support and that's okay. However, it's not normal to dread speaking to a friend for whatever reason. So, my biggest concern is how can this start being addressed on a bigger scale? An open dialogue seems to be the best place to start.",1
Can men talk about sex and not be considered sexist?,I‚Äôve noticed that there has been talk about something called ‚Äúlocker room talk‚Äù. According to the internet this is men talking about sex and some articles are straight up saying that it‚Äôs wrong for men to talk about sex at all. Aren‚Äôt there ways in which men can talk about sex in non degrading ways? I understand where these articles are coming from as sometimes men will use terms like ‚Äúpounding‚Äù that imply painful sex or use swear words to refer to body parts. But presumably is there is a moral difference between a man ‚Äúit felt so good when I Bleep bleep bleep‚Äù and a guy saying something like ‚Äúit felt amazing to have my penis inside her vagina‚Äù. I‚Äôm just very confused about the disctinruon between positive and negative conversation.,1
Why are men so obsessed with who women choose to date? And why do men so outwardly express resentment and hate for women due to loneliness and rejection while women deal with the same issues by internalising them?,"Being a fireman and spending a lot of time with men, and then just seeing groups and posts by men, it's clear men have a bizarre obsession with who women choose to date.

And these men are all over the map with their resentment and anger of the type of men women choose.  It ranges from women dating broke and lazy men who treat them bad to women choosing well off men that spoil them and then everything in between as long as it's negative.  It seems like as long as they're not being picked, women just must be picking bad or subservient weak men.

These men, which I don't believe are a small minority, don't just resent women, they also resentment the men they date and automatically assume they're shitty men.  

And let's be clear here, these men only resent and hate women they consider attractive.  Women they don't, who also go through rejection and loneliness, they don't even exist in their mind.  Because women they don't deem attractive are invisible, because they don't matter.  This is why you basically see men's groups, whether their alt right or menslib, you rarely see an acknowledgement that rejected and lonely women exist.  Because they really don't in their minds.

Then of course these men turn to groups that are nothing but terrorist groups aimed at harming women.  Many turn violent and commit terrorist acts like mass murder, abuse, harassment, threats of rape and murder, etc.

I know the catch-all for men's issues is men can't express their feelings.  The reality is, men have been incredibly proficient in creating massive communities of support to vent their feelings.  I don't think anyone is unsure of how these men feel because their dealing with their issues stoicly or suppressing them.  They're pretty much in your face and have caught societies attention.  And they rarely pass up a chance to express their feelings to women.   So, I'm not sure I can believe not expressing emotions or feelings is part of the problem.

Lonely and rejected women just don't go to the extremes men go to.  And women tend to internalize rejection, they tend to blame themselves and at times deal with self-hatred for being unwanted.  And they tend to keep to themselves.  Men on the other hand are the squeaky wheel that gets the grease.  And they're making sure as many people as possible know how they feel.

So why do you think men and women react so differently to the same problem of being lonely and rejected?  And why are men so obsessed with who women date and women aren't obsessed with who men date?",1

History Question: Gender politics &amp; social stigma in ancient babylon,"Also asked this on r/history.

Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I have trouble remembering the details here, but way back when I took AP World I remember reading something about social stigma in ancient babylon but I don't know if my memory is correct or if this is bs. So, I thought I'd come here for a fact check. Anyways, I remember reading about the history of gender in the ancient world, and I remember coming across something interesting. Basically what the article said is that because property was passed down through the man in a marriage, a stigma arose around women sleeping with lots of other men. So, basically the idea was that since we could be 100% certain about the baby's mother but weren't necessarily sure of the father, there could be confusion as to whose property the kid would inherit. This could lead to lengthy legal problems, and just add up costs over time. To avoid this confusion, babylonian society began instituting laws and had a stigma around women sleeping with more than one guy. This gave rise to a stigma that influenced society up and to the present day (and is one that many people still hold, though that stigma has certainly died down a bit). Anyways, is that true? Idk if historically that is true, so I thought I would ask. I can't remember where I read that, so if you know of a source, could you please provide one? If it's not true, where did that stigma come from? To me it seems kinda dumb to base our current thinking on the property laws of a society that existed over a millennium ago, but that's just me. I'm just curious as to whether or not this is true. Thanks for the info!",1

Why do women tolerate household disarray less than men in non explicitly sexist relationships?,"I was looking at the ""mental load/you should have asked"" comic and it seems the woman is doing the work because the man doesn't see all the problems the woman sees or is comfortable with those problems existing. It seems that this couple doesn't explicitly view housework or childrearing as the woman's duty. What causes women to generally not wait until the man gets fed up with the mess and cleans it up himself? And if this discrepancy is resolved, would that solve a lot of the second shift problems in couples where housework isn't consciously assigned by gender?

Edit: how can already adult couples change so the woman is more tolerant of the mess and men less tolerant of the mess?

Can women promote toxic masculinity?,"My mother is an ‚Äúold school‚Äù feminist and my father is an academic with socialist leanings. Most of the women I‚Äôve dated would call themselves feminists too. Despite this I feel I know little of the modern feminist movement and an trying to learn more. I started reading about toxic masculinity recently and it really got me thinking.

Most of the ‚Äòtoxic masculinity‚Äô I‚Äôve been exposed to are from women. My parents and my male friends never really forced me to adopt traditional male interests like sport or cars or violent video games. But I have been told I was ‚Äúgay‚Äù for trimming my nails by my first girlfriend, that I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt manly enough‚Äù because I was a vegetarian by another woman I dated, and that I was a ‚Äúpussy‚Äù for crying once, and have had many other similar things happen over the years.

I feel that I‚Äôve definitely learnt to suppress my emotions. If I feel upset or depressed I know there‚Äôs no way I can tell my partner
(despite her knowing all about toxic masculinity- she was the catalyst for me reading up about this stuff). At worst I‚Äôd be made fun of or have what I‚Äôve said be used against me in a future argument, at best it would just be awkward. Growing up I was told it was fine to express emotion, but as an adult I feel I‚Äôve been ‚Äútrained‚Äù by women to feel that it‚Äôs just not appealing or wanted. I‚Äôm in my 30s now and can definitely say that adopting a more traditional make traits like never talking about feelings has meant I‚Äôve had way more stable relationships (though it does suck sometimes - lesser of 2 evils).

Do you think women can perpetuate toxic masculinity? And where does normal masculinity   end and toxic masculinity start?

Edit: spelling",1
Do you think men have more to gain or to loose in ending the patriarchy ?,"I often read feminists writing things along the lines of ""men being in a dominant position in this patriarchy, they have no interests to question it"", and the likes. Though I agree that men have a dominant position and have therefore different interests, there certainly are antogonisms, this sounds a bit zero-sum to me. Many aspects of patriarchy are hurtful to men too, and if it's nowhere as bad as it is for women, it seems to me bad enough that ending the patriarchy is probably in the best interest of everyone.

This mindset seem problematic to me on several aspects, but mostly because framing most questions in terms of privileges men should give up, without emphasizing that they would also gain from giving them up, kind of makes feminism a threat to men when it doesn't have too, and a way tougher sell too.

I'm not saying this applies to each and every problematic, there are surely examples where this is false, but it feels to me that this is the case most often than not. I'd like to know if you feel the same.

There's probably a lot to say about the allyship vs. solidarity question here too, but I don't feel like I'm read enough on that question to discuss it (though my general feeling is that a synthesis would be good). If you want to comment on this however I would be interested too.

Another thing I think stems from this kind of thinking that I'm not too comfortable with: it gives the impression that men kind of have their common interests sorted out and this what guides their opinion and actions. But men just do what's seems best, or not too bad, for themselves in the context they are in, which happen to be patriarchy. It's not uncommon that when a man expresses certain opinions, arguments like ""of course you'd say this, everything to keep your privileges"", like this is part of mens strategy or something, and when women express the exact same thing suddenly it becomes internalized sexism or equivalent. Like women cannot understand how that serves a system, but men can. That's IMO both inaccurate, and troubling, how feminists are often prone to give an agency to men they're denying women...

If you feel like I got that position wrong, men having no interests in toppling patriarchy because of their dominant position in it, clarifications are welcome too.",1

Female Firefighters,"Hi all,

I recently checked out the percentage of female firefighters in the UK and it's [a measly 6.4 %](https://www.nationalfirechiefs.org.uk/News/new-statistics-show-an-increase-in-female-firefighters#:~:text=The%20increase%20in%20the%20number,and%20rescue%20services%20were%20women). In the US it's only [around 4%](https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/Emergency-Responders/US-fire-department-profile#:~:text=In%202018%2C%2093%2C700%20(8%25),30%20and%2049%20years%20old).

I have personal reasons for looking into this but I guess I had a bit of an inkling that the figures for female fire fighters would be quite low. The below is from [this](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/firefighters/#:~:text=Roughly%204%25%20of%20firefighters%20are,fitness%20standards%20needed%20for%20firefighting) article which looks at some of the reasons as to why the figures for female fire fighters are low.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**In their paper, Danbold and Bendersky argue that acceptance of women in the fire service is hindered by a clash between the collection of traits seen as essential to be a good firefighter ‚Äî called prototypes ‚Äî and the social stereotypes commonly assigned to men and women. If the prototypical firefighter is someone who carries people out of burning buildings, that‚Äôs going to fit more closely with masculine stereotypes. That, in turn, makes it harder to imagine a woman in that role.**

Looking at the stats for female police officers (29% in the UK, 11.9% US), which arguably also has traditionally been viewed as a 'man's job', the figures are much higher. I am now wondering why there is such a lag in the firefighting service compared to the police, which are both 'emergency services' with the purpose of helping people in distress.

(My theory is that image of the firefighter is akin to the  'knight in shining armour' and that a female firefighter would not fit that ideal of the masculine saviour. Just to reiterate this is just my personal theory.) EDIT: just realised that the excerpt above substantiates this

I am pro-choice and a preference utilitarian. I have asked this on r/askphilosphy but I wanted to ask y'all as well. Here is basically my thoughts on preference utilitarianism and abortion and I wanted to make sure that it made sense and was coherent. Thanks for reading it!,"Hello,

So I am a two-level preference utilitarian ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference\_utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_utilitarianism)). Basically anything on a system level (like how we should run government, etc) I tend to be more rule based and on an individual level more classically based. Anyways, the question of abortion inevitably invites extensive moral arguments (I come from a pretty conservative family and am a man (clearly the perfect voice for abortion  and women's issues /s), but I tend to be the only one who's pro-choice in family arguments and I wanted to make sure my thoughts make sense before discussing with family). Here's my take and I wanted to see if I had a flaw in my thinking (based on the initial principles, i.e. preference utilitarianism) and if what I say makes sense. So here goes:

I believe it is ok for a woman to have an abortion should she desire it because the vast vast majority of abortions take place when it's either in the earlier fetal stage or just a clump of cells (it is ok at later stages as well, it's just easier to discuss if we talk about a clump of cells). Those cells aren't sentient, and they don't have preferences, but a woman does, so her preference overrides that of the cells. Now, the counter to this that I have spent the most time thinking about is: Well doesn't that cluster of cells have a future to consider? Couldn't it have preferences that could be fulfilled? Yes, that's true, but the keyword is could. There is no guarantee that the cells would become a human being would on net fulfill the desires of those around them. They could be a fundamentally unhappy person who doesn't want to live the life they're living. They could also be the next Bill Gates, we have no way of knowing. You can't know that for certain. Personally, I find the first option more likely because by definition if a woman wants an abortion, she clearly doesn't want a kid, so she's not likely going to be the best mother she can be, it's just not really possible because deep down their preference to not be a mother would add up over time. That is a very strong preference and the kid would really have be guaranteed to satisfy a lot of preferences to overcome that. And frankly, we can't know if they will. Sure maybe, but we do know that the mother doesn't want to be a mother here and now, and we can predict this will likely remain true in the future. That's not even to factor in the preferences that would be satisified if we treated everyone like that had a right to personal autonomy (in perference utilitarianism this idea is where rights come from). This is all true of cases where the mother's life isn't in danger, but it is even more true in cases where her life is in danger (after all, she'd prefer to you know, not die), so that is an even stronger preference. Fundamentally, because there is a guarantee that the mother will have deep unsatisfied preferences that only add up over time (she may have to sacrifice opportunities and dreams she would've otherwise taken to be a mother), and the serious lack of a guarantee that the child would fulfill preferences, we have to treat the child's life as neutral and look at the negative utility that results from pregnancy, we find that the mother should be able to have an abortion should she so desire.

Also, side note #1. If we take the cells could live a happy life conclusion to its logical end, then technically every single genetically possible human should be created, and not only that, but we should engage in extensive cloning efforts because more people = more preferences met. Nobody is advocating for this, for good reason.

Side Note #2. Adoption. I will admit this one is trickier to address and may seem, from a ultilitarian point of view, a better option than abortion, however the statistics from adoption don't usually look all that good, and you have to factor in the negative utility that comes from pregnancy in and of itself and the negative utility from a lack of a right to bodily autonomy, as such, abortion is still a viable and good option to take in that situation. Plus if we see adoption as better because it allows the preferences of the cells to be met, clearly side not #1 is also true, so you and I shouldn't be arguing as you should be off making ever single genetically possible human and cloning yourself. Doing otherwise is hypocritical.

Anyways, is this coherent and does it make sense?

Thanks!

Edit:

Forgot to add, the huge number of abortions that result from sexual assault, rape, and truly tragic circumstances. It is even easier to argue for allowing abortion in those cases because of the strong preferences involved. Also, as many a feminist has pointed out, outlawing abortion inevitably lead to illegal abortions, which are always shadier, and riskier, but will definitely happen. ",1

Are women‚Äôs dating preferences problematic?,"What are your thoughts on women‚Äôs preferences for men that earn more than themselves and for men that exhibit benevolent sexist behaviours? There is a vast amount of literature documenting women‚Äôs preference for men that are [high earners](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40806-016-0048-6#Sec10), even for women with a [higher education](https://ifstudies.org/blog/better-educated-women-still-prefer-higher-earning-husbands) and income. Although according to [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/20/americans-see-men-as-the-financial-providers-even-as-womens-contributions-grow/), as of 2017, women earn more than men in 28% of married and cohabiting couples, which is promising progress. Yet, despite¬†the prevalence of this preference I do not see it discussed very much, if at all, by feminists. This is surprising to me as I would have thought feminists would be imploring women to prioritise other qualities in a potential partner, such as: empathy, egalitarianism, kindness, patience, etc.

However, what is even more surprising is a [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325153053_Benevolent_Sexism_and_Mate_Preferences_Why_Do_Women_Prefer_Benevolent_Men_Despite_Recognizing_That_They_Can_Be_Undermining) that found that women prefer men that possess benevolent sexist attitudes despite the [potential downsides](https://theconversation.com/why-women-including-feminists-are-still-attracted-to-benevolently-sexist-men-101067). This was true for ‚Äúhigh feminist and low feminist women‚Äù. Is it not a problem that¬†a significant portion of women, including feminist women,¬†prefer¬†benevolent sexist men?

*A review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million boys and girls who were students from 1914 to 2011 blows apart that idea. For 100 years, according to the data that included students from 30 countries, girls have been outperforming boys in all of their classes ‚Äî reading, language and math and science. And they‚Äôve been doing it throughout their academic careers, from elementary school to high school. Which also means that the ‚Äúboy crisis‚Äù ‚Äî the worry that boys have recently been falling precipitously behind girls academically ‚Äî is also a fallacy. They‚Äôve been getting lower grades than girls for a century.*

Even when sexism and misogyny cut off the vast majority of careers and the workforce to women, and girls could really only dream of becoming maybe a nurse, secretary or teacher, they still outperformed boys who had access to higher education, the majority of careers and the workforce.  Just based on that you'd think girl's would believe education was a waste of time, leading to resentment and there would be a ""girl crisis"" where girl's would get lower grades than boys.

So girl's outperforming boys, even in math and science isn't something new.  Despite the myth we so often seen propagated in alt right and even progressive men's groups that this is a relatively new phenomenon plaguing boys due to the ""feminization"" of academia.  And when it comes to higher education women get more scholarships so it's cheaper, despite the fact that women are on the hook for almost 70% of the [1.5  trillion dollar student debt crisis](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/13/american-women-hold-two-thirds-of-all-student-debt-heres-why.html).  Not to mention the fact that all women will statistically earn less money even with higher degrees than white men.

So what's going on with boys and/or the educational system for the last century and spanning 30 different countries where girl's have been outperforming them?",1

Internalised sexism as a female,"How do i deal with Internalised sexism as a female?

Hi, over the years ive delved into feminism a little more and it has brought me comfort and allowed me to grow as a person. I know this is only minor but i have recently noticed that as my perception of women has changed (and also of myself) i have started to look and women online and in person and think to myself ‚Äúwow shes really cool‚Äù not ‚Äúpretty‚Äù or any other term referring to her appearance merely her personality or talent. 

Not saying theres anything wrong with recognising someone‚Äôs attractiveness but due to my expectations and shame around my own appearance due to being bullied by boys my age and media standards i became obsessed. Now i am able to value myself in other areas and am more confident not feeling that i have to ‚Äúglow up‚Äù all the time as i see myself as my whole which i am proud of.",1

Marxist Feminism: What are cis white men supposed to be doing?,"Hello all and thanks to any and all giving their time to read or reply.

I'm a cis white male who has spent a lot of time studying Marxism, communism, etc... and have been trying lately to incorporate a lot of Marxist Feminism/Intersectional feminism into my studies. I've had a really hard time ingesting this material and an even more difficult time ingesting  more liberal/centrist feminism. I understand the need for spaces where men aren't allowed to communicate, nearly every podcast I could find on these topics was female-exclusive, but where is the bridge for cis white men to even understand the concepts that are being taught? Every five minutes is a random gut punch where a host, usually a PhD or Masters level white woman, takes a crack at cis white men (usually always random and for the purpose of some type of joke), and I find myself wondering how long I can listen before giving up. For context I've listened several hundred hours of Marxist content and probably 20-30 hours of Feminist Marxist content. At the end of every segment I am still left wondering what is wanted from me and generally just left with the impression that disappearing is the only desired outcome. Very rarely a white male makes an appearance, on the few podcasts where they're allowed, and there is always a lot of them just joining in on the bashing with little information on what the appropriate action is from a white male.

I'm just kind of confused. I could never share any of these podcasts with my brother or even male peers be they white or not because they seem uninterested in offering actionable content so much as just random ridicule. As a white male who grew up in a trailor park and still can't make ends meet, with a lot of abuse and trauma to boot, I guess I'm just not sure how modern or left feminism intends to overcome the struggles of a patriarchal or capitalist society without white men.

I apologize if I'm coming from such a narrow perspective but I'm just lost after a lot of time and research. I know we live in a patriarchy. I know we live in a white supremacist world. What I don't understand is how extremely well educated women plan on broke af white men ever gaining the perspectives and knowledge necessary to help be part of the solution. Thanks for any insights you can give and please give any critiques you want as well. I'm trying to gain thicker skin through all of this and my personal leanings are toward a socialistic/communistic end. I think the patriarch harms men as much as women if you look at the death and trauma boys go through, but I'm just not seeing a lot of compassion coming out of any of the places I seek perspective from and I'm having a really hard time figuring out how I am supposed to move or contribute to solutions.

Edit: I initially wanted to respond to every comment but I'm under some time constraints today so unfortunately I can't. (But I read and will re-read every comment several times as I come back to this thread over the coming weeks)

You've all been so patient and warm with the responses even when I've sounded (been) whiny and needed a perspective enhancement. I'm really glad I came here with something that has been bothering me and I really needed your insights to re-frame myself and my relationship with this kind of knowledge and improvement on my own thoughts, behaviors, and interactions.You're all amazing and God is definitely a woman.

How much would doing porn affect my future schooling and employment prospects?,"I kind of cant believe I'm writing this, but here we are :/

Like many people right now, I'm not doing so hot financially, my bank account balance is sitting at -$90, and anything I can do to make some extra money on the side is on the table.

I certainly don't have anything against anyone who's done porn, and I'm not embarassed or ashamed that this is something I'm seriously considering, im mostly angry that I as a young adult with a full time job don't make enough money to live on during this pandemic.

I'm in my early twenties and eventually would like to go to gradschool and hopefully publish some stuff, obviously I wouldn't produce anything nsfw under my real name, but I'm paranoid it could hamper the dreams I have for the future if it was found out.

Though who knows, I had to drop out of school due to monetary and 2020 reasons, so who knows if I'll even be able to get my undergrad much less my graduate degree...

A former male friend hates feminism in my DM's,"I post many different topics on my private Instagram account, from diet culture, racism, to the fall of patriarchy and personal experiences with men. A guy (23) from my former school class has been following me for half a year. We haven't seen each other for 3 years. He always seemed nice and harmonious and we got along great. No drama, no sexism, nothing. Since he has followed me, he has been answering my statements in the stories 3 times a week, accusing me of hating men and that a lot more people would listen to me if I were to formulate my feminist opinion ""nicer"". The usual talk.  But even when I deal with other topics that don't attack him as a man (e.g. ""Calorie reminder for the holidays: 1200 calories are the daily requirement of a toddler. Not that of an adult woman."") he texts me and annoys me. He describes my information as baseless and compares me to a flat earther.

He uses various manipulation techniques when I call him out on his behavior: ""I'm sorry that I questioned you. Maybe I'm just controlled by patriarchy and the diet culture!"" He is committed to misunderstanding me.

We text back and forth. Sometimes I think he has a romantic interest in me because he often attacks me when I've posted nice selfies beforehand. On the other hand, I'm taken and he has had a girlfriend for 2 years. And knocking someone down is not nice either. I don't want to block him because I've always liked him. On the other hand, it steals my energy.

Does anyone have an explanation for this behavior? Has that happened to you before?",1

Dismissing sexual frustration,"As a guy I believe the following statements are true 

1. Wanting romantic/sexual companionship and not having it sucks, and the longer you go without it, the more it sucks.
2. No other human being on the planet is obliged to provide you with such companionship, and there is no sure-fire formula for getting it.

Now, if a chronically single man agrees with me that both of these statements are true. The best we as a society can do is commiserate the tragedy of human existence. But from what I've seen, almost everytime someone says how much rejection/friendzone/unrequited love/etc, makes them feel horrible, someone else will make a rather unfriendly and dismissive comment about how ""women don't owe you sex"" or something about ""putting niceness in and expecting sex to come out"". Even when there's absolutely no indication that person thinks so.

Some people might say it's common enough to just assume they have these beliefs. But I disagree that this is how you justify being shitty to someone. It is presumptive, aggressive, accusatory, and rude. People can feel frustrated about it without also feeling entitled. I don't think it's unreasonable for someone to say ""I'm frustrated because I'm not able to start a relationship or have sex"" without being told they're an entitled twat for that.

And I think this is at the core of the problem of why male loneliness is at a record high. People are always ready to point out statement #2, but they don't really internalize the significance of statement #1. This is what leads to incel communities being made and the male suicide rate being 3.5x higher than women. Not only are lonely men not able to find satisfaction in their lives, they are constantly having there issues and feelings dismissed.

I'm honestly kinda ranting but I really want a feminist take on this. Sorry for any grammar or format errors, on mobile",1

What do you do when your family has non-feministic attitudes?,"I have just found out that my younger sister ‚Äôs teacher makes what I think are inappropriate and sexist jokes. My sister thinks it is ok for her (male) teacher to make jokes about a girl‚Äôs appearance (joking in a zoom class about her not wearing makeup and looking bad because of it), and inappropriate jokes about a fellow female teacher (on zoom this male teacher and a female teacher turned up wearing the same colours. The female teacher commented on the coincidence joking that they must share the same wardrobe, the male teacher ‚Äújoked‚Äù that they put on the same clothes/colours just after getting out of bed together‚Ä¶). My sister thinks this is funny and not gendered, everyday sexism hidden in the form of a joke to justify it. She says he does it to everyone but the only two examples she could give me where when he made jokes about the girl and woman (therefore in this instance, clearly gendered).

My mum‚Äôs attitude is that we just need to take a step back and let the world ‚Äúsort itself out‚Äù. When I push back on her attitude by saying, ‚Äú*We* have to sort the world out, it‚Äôs not just going to do it by itself‚Äù, she changes the subject and glosses over what I am saying. My other family members are basically the same, with the women in my family full of internalised misogyny, and I can‚Äôt seem to resonate with any of them for very long about feminism as a whole. Because of this I am finding I am distancing myself from them more and more as it just infuriates and frustrates me that they won‚Äôt see/aren‚Äôt willing to see how 3rd wave feminism is a good thing and how it is very much needed in our current society.

How do I reach them and teach them about the need for feminism in a way that they‚Äôll actually listen? How do I show my sister that feminism is good and that there is everyday sexism that she is shrugging off? Sadly, I really doubt that there is much hope of changing my mum and the other family members as they‚Äôre stubborn and their believes are deeply ingrained in them, but I really want to try to reach my sister even if it is just to get her thinking about everyday encounters from a feminist perspective. Obviously, I don‚Äôt want to push it on her if she really doesn‚Äôt want to listen, but I want to try as I don‚Äôt want to distance myself from her too. I was thinking of getting her a feminist book for her birthday, but I don‚Äôt think she would appreciate it let alone actually read it. So I‚Äôm not really sure what to do. Any suggests or ideas would be greatly appreciated!",1

Question about abortion,"I am 100% pro-choice and I believe, that abortion should be legal until the fetus is able to survive on its own. However I am very concerned with the trend, that many cis women decide to abort fetuses with traits they deem as undesirable (we see this trend in iceland with down's syndrome fetuses).

As more scientific progress occurs, I fear that cis women will choose to abort other fetuses, that they deem undesirable (like gay people, trans people, people with autism) as soon as it is scientifically possible to detect these things in a fetus. There would only have to be a minor cultural shift and cis women have the choice to exterminate any group of people they want.

My question is how can we ensure, that trans, gay, autistic and other people will not disappear like down's syndrome people in iceland, as soon as these traits are detectable?",1

***Arguments for why feminism has failed:***

Men still -

1. run 91% of countries (175 out of 192)
2. run 95% of companies [https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-so-few-ceos-are-women-you-can-have-a-seat-at-the-table-and-not-be-a-player-11581003276](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-so-few-ceos-are-women-you-can-have-a-seat-at-the-table-and-not-be-a-player-11581003276)

4. are 88% of billionaires [https://www.statista.com/statistics/778577/billionaires-gender-distribution/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/778577/billionaires-gender-distribution/)
5. see 22% of their workforce make $100,000 or above in the United States compared to just 9% of women [https://dqydj.com/2018-income-by-sex/](https://dqydj.com/2018-income-by-sex/).

* The gender pay gap remains stagnant. In the US for instance, men earned $66,000 on average pre-tax in 2017 compared to women making $45,000. In 2020, it's $72,000 to $51,000. The pay gap is larger in other first world countries and of course much larger in second and third world territories, and it's expected to RISE rather than decrease in the future due to the effects of the pandemic.
* Violence against women is at it's highest rates in decades, in the US, Europe and elsewhere around the world. Femicides in particular are surging at levels rarely seen before. Some of the sources on the growing violence can be seen here [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-games/201909/the-number-women-murdered-partner-is-rising](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-games/201909/the-number-women-murdered-partner-is-rising), here [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/domestic-violence-international.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/domestic-violence-international.html) and here [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-latam-violence-trf/rising-violence-against-women-in-latin-america-confirms-fears-of-abuses-in-lockdowns-idUSKBN23G2X6](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-latam-violence-trf/rising-violence-against-women-in-latin-america-confirms-fears-of-abuses-in-lockdowns-idUSKBN23G2X6).
* Female employment on the whole is at its lowest levels since 1988 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/2020/11/06/women-workforce-jobs-report/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/2020/11/06/women-workforce-jobs-report/) and the figures could well struggle to rebound for a generation [https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-55016842](https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-55016842).
* Women continue to struggle to break into high-paying male dominated fields, comprising a majority in low paying professions like nursing, teaching and healthcare while struggling to climb above 10-15% of money making jobs in engineering, finance, law or as doctors etc. An example of this can be seen in a gender breakdown of doctors by speciality [https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2018/10/men-outnumber-women-3-to-1-in-some-specialties-in-the-u-k/](https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2018/10/men-outnumber-women-3-to-1-in-some-specialties-in-the-u-k/).",1

I'm a guy. I saw a post on here today about someone being unsure of what to do when they are catcalled. I realized that had I been in the situation the poster there described, I wouldn't have known what to do. So, I thought I'd ask: how should I respond when I see someone getting catcalled or harassed? Like say I'm at work and I notice my boss being too touchy-feely with a female co-worker and she has expressed to me it makes her uncomfortable. What should I do in that situation? Should I even intervene or should I leave the situation alone, I want to help but I don't want to make things worse. I don't know, as a guy I've never been catcalled or harassed. I don't really know how to respond if I see it happening or even if i should for fear of making things worse for the victim. So yeah, how do I respond?

Why there are women who aren‚Äôt feminists?,,1
"Is saying America or Canada have a problem with femicide as well as it being unsafe for women an insult to other nations like Mexico, SA, etc?","I see American/Canadian feminists claim that we have a problem with 'femicide' in America or Canada.

I personally dont know any woman who's been murdered. Hell, in my state of colorado, with a pop.of 5million, the number of murders was what, 32 in 2018? In my very safe city, not sure the number, I'd wager it's LESS than 10.

My neighborhood is also safe. I see girls out all the time, day and night. None of them seem to be in any fear. Hell, my sisters and mom used to go out all the time b4 covid. My sister doesnt fear going out at night at all.

It's been like this everywhere I've lived. Not sure if it's just the girls I interact, but none of them seem to fear going out at all in night. None of them seem to be as scared as you would think when you read feminists comments online (that women fear going out aline at night). It's like this here, as well as back in AZ. Or when I visit fam in Xanada.

My main question is, is saying America (or Canada) has an issue with femicide an insult to other countries like Colombia, SA? Also, I've seen the 3women/killed per day in America. That amounts close to 1100 women murdered per year in America. With a pop. of 320mil. Compared to others nation with a MUCH lower population, as well as more women being killed. Is this diminishing the meaning of femicide?",1

This blogpost is what made me want to ask this question, so please read through it if you'd like. But it's basic argument is that there are a hell of a lot of people attracted to women who seem to have internalized the message that their attraction makes them sick and wrong and evil and creepy, that basically any interaction they have with a woman is coercive or harmful on their part, and that initiating a romantic interaction makes them a sexual predator.

I relate to this post quite a lot. I internalized these messages from exposure to feminist memes, norms, and communities. It was feminist messages, not catholic or religious ones, that made it hardest for me to come to terms with my sexuality. It wasn‚Äôt intentional. But it happened. And it has happened by now to enough people that 'well obviously you‚Äôre misinterpreting it‚Äô is starting to wear thin as an excuse. Lots and lots of people are misinterpreting the way I did. By and large, we‚Äôre vulnerable people. I suppose the response I expect the most is a denial of the existence of this phenomenon, or even the possibility of it. But that would just prove to me that the male experience will always be invalidated in the face of the dominant narrative, irrespective of how much it matters.",1
"What do you think about this statement from 'The Palgrave Handbook of Male Psychology and Mental Health' regarding the phrase ""toxic masculinity""?","&gt;There is a serious risk arising from using terms such as ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù. Unlike ‚Äúmale depression‚Äù, which helps identify a set of symptoms that can be alleviated with therapy, the term ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù has no clinical value. In fact it is an example of another cognitive distortion called labelling (Yurica et al. 2005). Negative labelling and terminology usually have a negative impact, including self-fulflling prophecies and alienation of the groups who are being labelled. We wouldn‚Äôt use the term ‚Äútoxic‚Äù to describe any other human demographic. Such a term would be unthinkable with reference to age, disability, ethnicity or religion. The same principle of respect must surely apply to the male gender. It is likely therefore that developing a more realistic and positive narrative about masculinity in our culture will be a good thing for everyone.",1

What are your issues with pornhub? What are some alternatives?,"Recently porn hub has deleted over 1 million videos created by unverified users to try to remedy some recent complaints about videos that have violated their guidelines.


 A lot of people have been critical of this move but I personally like that they‚Äôre attempting to pay CLOSER attention to abuse and general fucked up shit on their site. 

 I‚Äôve abstained from a lot of the mainstream porn sites these past couple of months. My main Hang ups about most of the sites is that they seem indifferent to abuse on their site. 

Due to the vast nature these that are inherent to these YouTube-like platforms, I don‚Äôt expect EVERYTHING to be clean. Even on YouTube there are some pretty fucked up corners, just because there‚Äôs some illegal shit on their site doesn‚Äôt mean they support it. But I also think that porn sites are a lot more vulnerable to illegal fucked up shit cuz it‚Äôs to appease the viewers sexual hunger. So I think it should be a high priority to moderate these sites for the safety of people all over the world since they‚Äôre inherently MORE LIKELY to contain that content.

Again, this isn‚Äôt a fool proof method. But I do respect that they‚Äôre directly addressing this issue.

I came back to the site to give it my, let‚Äôs say ‚Äúviewer support‚Äù but my question to y‚Äôall is, what are some of your hang ups or criticisms with specifically pornhub. I don‚Äôt think porn is inherently misogynistic, but I don‚Äôt wanna enable some misogynistic tendencies (if that wording makes sense). I dont wanna lean on ONE THING I respect about pornhub to justify all the other BS that goes on behind the scenes. Porn is nice, but some things matter more than momentary fulfillment.

Another question, what are some good alternatives to the mainstream porn sites? Mainly, porn sites with a feminist mindset or a site that‚Äôs heavily moderated to prevent abuse from slipping under the cracks. 

Bellesa was a pretty nice one that‚Äôs free. Other sites I‚Äôve searched have only had a paying option. Maybe it‚Äôs just the reality that you have to pay to support some of these underground sites, but any feedback would be appreciated.",1

Is there common ground to be found with someone who rejects modern feminism? And if so what?,"Mutual beliefs or assumptions are essential in having any sort of real communication with another person. This is especially hard to come by when their viewpoints start out as polar opposites.

Hence my question. Have you ever found common ground when going into a discussion about feminism with someone who turns out to be completely against current day feminism (just the ideology of whatever wave we're at now in the western world)? And if so, what did that turn out to be? Or if anything the points you'd take away from such a conversation.",1
Why do people forget that the FGM ban declared unconstitutional - because of male circumcision,"So First off I am strongly against all forms of genital cutting, which makes me a subject of ridicule in the United States, where most people support male circumcision and body shame people like me who are intact. So recently I found out that FGM became legal in the United States because the ban was ruled unconstitutional because it included a ban on all forms of FGM, including the rare minor form Called hoodectomy, which is directly equivalent to male circumcision. I am aware that most of you are against circumcision and I am grateful to know that. I am wondering why people haven‚Äôt realized that to eradicate all forms of FGM we constitutionally must ban male circumcision and intersex surgeries as well. The only way to ban hoodectomy is to ban male circumcision with it. Do you have some ideas why people didn‚Äôt pay attention to the fact that male circumcision is causing FGM to become legal? I‚Äôd like to have some insight and figured this would be a good place to share ideas to spread awareness about circumcision and how it is keeping FGM from being banned like it should be.",1

 New law says that without explicit consent, it is rape.

Are men more driven and career-oriented?,"Do men derive more pleasure from career fullfilment than women? For example, women want equal representations in top positions etc., but they tend to want work life balance, and men at the top don't want to give in to that/can get away with not taking time off for kids etc., thus they can put in more work and continue to dominate top positions.

I think even women who are committed to their work and their professional goals, who want to contribute something to the world, are interested in pursuing other things/interests, making time for family (not neccesarily children), making sure that a household runs smoothly and that everyone around them is taken care of etc., more than men are.

Is this because of how men and women are raised, or because of our biological make-up, or both? Should we try to change this? if so, in what way?

"Even though it happened a couple months ago, what's your opinion of 'Naked Athena' that happened in Portland?","This has been bothering me lately. Like, a protest that occurred in Portland about BLM. Black ppl getting killed by cops and all. And some white woman decided to undress herself and stand in front of the cops. Butt a$$ naked. Flashing her genitals. Like what did she achieve with that? I dont see any correlation between BLM, and getting naked in front of cops? I'm just curious to know whats your opinion on that.

Women/Girl's pain treated less seriously than Men/Boy's pain.,"[Study's have found that female patient's pain is treated less seriously as male patient's pain.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/31/americans-take-pain-girls-less-seriously-than-that-boys-new-study-finds/)  This article is dealing with young girl's pain but there are studies that show that [women's pain is taken less seriously than men's pain.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/is-bias-keeping-female-minority-patients-from-getting-proper-care-for-their-pain/2019/07/26/9d1b3a78-a810-11e9-9214-246e594de5d5_story.html)  Women are not only have to wait longer to receive medication for pain, they receive pain med's less than men.  And women are given psychiatric medication for pain at a much higher rate than men.  

As a first responder it wasn't unusual for EMT's to assess women for mental conditions before treating them for pain.  It also wasn't unusual for EMT's to question whether women were exaggerating their pain because of course, women are more emotional and neurotic than men.  Men are strong, stoic and reliable when talking about their pain, so if a man says he's hurting, get him some pain meds stat because it must be serious.

The biggest myth I see in progressive men's groups like menslib and alt-right groups is that the medical community ignores men and caters to women.  This must be why women access medical help more often than men?  But the truth is, women are not rewarded for being proactive about their health.  They're stigmatized as being dramatic and emotional attention seekers.  Whereas men are brave and stoic and only access help when absolutely needed.  

Just because the medical community targets women in ads doesn't mean women or girl's are treated well once they try to receive help.  Women are targeted for monetary gain because they know women are more likely to access help which means more money for hospitals and doctors.  The myth propagated by men's groups that the medical community just loves and cares about women more than men is laughable in the face of studies done in regards to the different treatment men and women receive. 

I'm interested in hearing feminist's thoughts on this subject.  How women are treated by medical professionals and why it's such a common myth that when women enter the medical system that they're needs are catered to, when studies show the exact opposite.",1

What were the various reasons for preventing women from intellectual professions?,"I recently posted a question regarding JBP's ""Patriarchy doesn't exist because men are more likely to end up in prisons and they had to die in war"" 
and I came to the most logical conclusion that patriarchy isn't necessarily a function where men aren't always ""on top"" of the social hierarchy, but its a function which puts men in charge of socitey, regardless whether they do it reactively or proactively (ie. Becoming a respected leader non-violently vs. Turning into an infamous criminal), and women having little say on the matter. Denying patriarchy existed is a shameless attemp to revise history and sociology where there are literally historical texts and ""thinkers"" not having anything favorable to say about women except for being mothers.

So when it came to educational institutions historically banning women from entering school, they could attribute it to schools being more likely to teach about fighting and therefore girls weren't allowed in schools. There was a point where these institutions no longer required to teach students solely about fighting yet they still demanded to latch onto those traditions and justify preventing women from entering .

But what about intellectual professions? What were the various reasons why women were prevented scholarships and reading?",1
So here's a question and I hope that its appropriate‚Ä¶," 

If  some male actually did the awful thing of sexually approaching a few or  couple of females inappropriately and uninvited or sexually harassing  them when he was too drunk (not that that's an excuse,as he chose to get  that drunk) before in life (and he stopped after the no and/or more  clearer -perhaps including even physical- no's to his absolutely drunken  mind at the times and then that was it as in he did not do something  like that again after those times, to whoever)‚Ä¶

Does  that mean that he deserves to be falsely accused (either officially to  the authorities or while being the victim of false rumors,gossips and  slander) later on in life by another female or other females of sexual  harassment or assault or rape or having sex or doing something sexual  with or to them when he did nothing of the sort with or to them? It's an  obvious no to me but would some people perhaps think that he deserves  it? I think that even if one not only approached and stopped after the  rejection but actually insistently sexually harassed someone or raped  them then that doesn't mean that that person deserves to be falsely  accused of other things by whoever‚Ä¶",1
Why are sexist characters on television always written to be charismatic?,"The ones that immediately come to mind are Joey from Friends and Barney from How I Met Your Mother, as they have a tendency to objectify female characters on their shows and lie to women when pursuing sex. I notice how popular these characters are among their fanbases because they're seen as ""cool"", but I see them as problematic especially considering that these shows are PG and can leave an impression on young boys.

Is it a byproduct of what the writers aspire to be, is it a type of character that male audiences find entertaining, or something else?",1
"Why have single motherhood, divorce rates and bastard children risen with the advent of modern feminism?","I see and every one knows that since the 1960's the sexual revolution, feminism, access to birth control, female sexual liberation and abortion have increased; with the latter two being subsidized by the government to some degrees. Why is it then that despite increases in medical technology to prevent unwanted birth which has granted women control over their sexual reproduction has out of wedlock births, teenage pregnancy, single motherhood is increasing and continues to increase? 
This mainly effects lower class people than upper class as is seen with the increased calls for welfare, food stamps, government subsidized child care among other things.",1
Does using products/services made in a toxic work environment make me a hypocrite?,"So just for the record I wouldn't exactly label myself as a feminist activist, but I do have strong feminist leanings and I believe women should continue to fight for equal rights in order to bring an end to sexual harassment, the glass ceiling, and an end to the toxic work environment.

From what I understand a toxic work environment is where minorities, disabled people, LGBTQ groups, and especially women are harassed, there is a culture of nepotism, and a majority of employees are constantly overworked and underpaid. When I learned about this concept I promised myself that I would not work for a company that has a toxic work environment or buy any products or services that are made by a toxic work environment.

Hopefully the first one won't be too hard, but it's the second part that worries me. I looked up some companies that have toxic work environment and I was surprised that some of my favorite companies like Disney has a toxic work environment. I know this sounds superficial but some of my favorite stress-relieving media comes from these companies like the marvel comics and movies, the pixar movies, the Studio Ghibli films, and so much more. I'm sure it may sound like peanuts to some people but these things from Disney help me have some thing to look forward to at the end of the day.

The problem is that well I feel like I'm not being true to myself because a lot of the work that the employees put into these products, are overworked, underpaid, and sometimes harassed by the upper management. I feel as if that by buying/using the products of a company that has a toxic environment I'm betraying a part of myself.

Does using a company's products and services really make me a moral hypocrite? Is there anyway to rationalize my choices?",1
"Several women in the US have recently been charged with murder after giving birth to stillborn babies.

Why is feminism becoming increasingly hostile towards queer people?,"Over the last couple of years I have observed what I perceive to be a significant increase in hostility towards trans people among self-identified feminists. This is especially evident in countries like the UK where transphobic feminists have a lot of institutional power and are being portrayed by the media as the dominant type of feminism. I get that a lot of this is astroturfed by conservative lobby groups like the heritage foundation and Alliance defending freedom, but I am fascinated and shocked by how so many feminists are so easily influenced by rhetoric that mirrors the hate other minority groups and women have been victims of in the past. What fascinates me even more is the increased willingness of these people to not only attack trans people, but also the broader queer community. To add even more confusion to the mix, many of these people hold positions that are very similar to mine on the overwhelming majority of feminist issues, but have seemingly bought into anti-queer propaganda for no apparent reason.

Any hate or discrimination towards minority groups is incompatible with my feminism, but I am afraid that simply brushing them off as not being feminists, is actively ignoring a growing problem that is increasingly seeping into broader feminist discourse. Why do some feminists have a propensity towards queerphobia, and why do so many seemingly progressive and reasonable people buy into regressive social ideologies that are better left in the past?",1
Do Radical Feminists consider Queer Theory to be liberal feminism?,"Do Radical Feminists consider Queer Theory to be ""liberal feminism?""

It should come as no surprise that many radical feminists like to disagree with what they term ""liberal feminists."" Those that do also tend to disagree with a lot with 3rd wave feminists, often describing third wave feminists as ""liberal feminists."" Well, queer theory is largely recognized to be part of the third wave; it tends to be sex positive, largely propelling the sex-positive feminist movement forward, and in that aspect, tends to emphasize the importance of sexual choice.

But queer theory is grounded in continental philosophy (as is a lot of third wave feminism like intersectionality), and queer theorists like Foucault have been very critical of liberalism in general. They probably wouldn't describe themselves as the same kind of feminist as Martha Nussbaum who identifies as a liberal feminist and bases her philosophy on liberalism (Locke, Rawls, Sen). And just from my personal perspective, I am not sure radical feminists disagree with Martha Nussbaum and let's say a first wave liberal feminist like Mary Wallestonecraft as much as they do queer theorists. So do radical feminists consider queer theory to be liberal feminism?",1
"Why is there such a negative connotation behind ""straight white cis males""?","I identify as a straight white cis male, and I like to think that I'm extremely progressive in my views. However, I feel like a lot of the feminist community has made ""straight white cis male"" a dirty phrase, like I should feel bad for being one.",1
How did you experience your first periods and what did you wish you were told?,"I'm doing a project on menstruation aimed at figuring out a way to make it easier, safer and less scary for young girls to learn about and deal with their first periods. For this I'm looking to gather information on how women of all ages experienced their first periods and that stage in life. I'd like to know how you learned about it, when you learned about it (before or after your first period, if, what and how you were explained on the topic, whether you received external help at all,...). Whether you experienced it as a frightening thing or if you felt safe and understood. And specifically what you feel could have made it easier on you.

For me there was a certain taboo that I felt around it. We had one sex ed class which was very graphic and confusing, and that sudden information, coupled with the embarassement I felt with all the boys in the room joking and being grossed out literally made me vomit and cry. In my family the conversation was pretty limited. Both my mother and father tried to be positive and supportive about it, yet seemed to want to end the conversation quickly. I felt like I went through it pretty much alone because of that and would only talk to my mother about it if I was really scared about something. I'd love to have had the relationship back then (that I do have now) where it was just a normal conversational topic.",1
"Is being ""Cis"" a priviledge?","I had a discussion with my friend, she told me ""cis priviledge"" doesn't exist. Its weird because while they recognize that a cis man has priviledge over a trans man they don't think a cis woman has priviledge over a trans woman for being cis. What do you think of this analysis?",1
What's your local music scene like? What are your experiences?,"I suppose this is more of a pre-pandemic question, but how would you describe the music scene in your area? Are there other feminists? Are promoters clear about their stance on abuse and harassment, and do venues have safer space policies? Are there people who initiate or attempt restorative justice after something has happened?

I was involved in the local punk/metal scene for almost 10 years and was on the receiving end of misogynistic bullshit from both men and women. Hating on women for how much sex they had and what kind of sex they had was the norm, and it was very much a huge clique. People talked shit about other women behind their back then would turn around and be super friendly to them at shows‚Äîit was sickening. 

One white woman would make comments to me, a eurasian femme, about how small my tits were, and how she could never not shave her pits like me, or not remove her upper lip hair, all the while holding events for ""women supporting women."" 

I was touched inappropriately countless times at events and would post about it on social media, telling people to keep their hands to themselves.  Others did this too. It seemed like every six months there was some musician being called out for being abusive, but nothing changed. 

One prominent metal promoter never spoke up about how harassment wouldn't be tolerated at his events, nor attempted to implement a safer spaces policy. In fact, he still supported a band even after the lead singer had groped a woman at a show of his. I guess it's not surprising behaviour considering he played in a band with a rapist.

I had to remove myself from the scene entirely. It's super disappointing to love a particular genre of music but be driven out of a community for it's hatred toward women and bro-code culture.",1
Is it appropriate to compliment a woman at the beach?,"I was talking to my boyfriend earlier cause he brought up the subject, we were talking about complimenting women in public, he said if he saw a woman on the beach and thought she was good looking (and wasn‚Äôt dating me) he thinks it‚Äôs appropriate to go up to her and tell her she looks good. I told him if I was at the beach in a bikini and some guy I don‚Äôt know came up to me and complimented my body I would be very uncomfortable. He said if it‚Äôs in a public place (including the beach) then it‚Äôs okay, I said I would feel uncomfortable if I‚Äôm wearing bathers, I should be able to go to the beach and wear bathers without being looked at and commented on. If I‚Äôm at the beach and everyone else is in bathers I‚Äôm good with that but once I‚Äôve been singled out by a stranger I feel vulnerable and uncomfortable.

He also asked if a woman came up to me and complimented me how would I feel and I said I‚Äôd be fine with that, he said that‚Äôs unfair and that women can be just as dangerous as men to other women, I said sure, but it‚Äôs a whole lot less likely so I‚Äôm comfortable with it.

Detaching from the male gaze,"Does detaching from satisfying the male gaze mean we can never genuinely like skirts, shaving, and all things male gaze-y as these choices are rooted in patriarchy?",1
What do Feminists think about sweet yet sexist people?,"I know this sounds like a oxymoron. What I mean there are people out there that are genuinely more friendly and caring than the average person, but then say some sexist stuff as well, because of the culture they grew up in. I usually see this in older people.

Further doubts(edit)

Assuming this person is irrational(cannot conceive of stats, makes blissfully fallacious arguments), yet ""good natured""(hardworking, sacrifices a lot for their loved ones, no malicious intent).

"Informed Consent matters, why aren't minors who lie about their age considered rapists?","Informed Consent is an important factor of consent that both parties know what they're getting into and who they're getting intimate with. Someone who had sex with someone under the pretenses of a condom being present, did not consent to sex with the condom secretly off. Likewise for impersonation of another person.

The issue of a minor lying to get with an adult they're attracted to is an issue for adults of all genders and sexual orientations. Gay men and lesbian women also suffer from this issue as there are [reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/j8z9qs/psa_dont_lie_about_your_age_i_almost_hooked_up/) about it being an issue on their respective dating apps as well.

In these cases the adult consented to sex with someone who they believed to be an adult, they would not have had sex with the minor otherwise. Adults who are victim to this genuinely feel sickened and violated that they were manipulated into having sex with a child, an entirely different persona than the one presented.

The adult did not have informed consent, so why is a lying minor absolved of rape? From a feminist perspective, would lying about age dramatically changing one's personhood from minor to adult, violate informed consent?",1
Workplace Advice,"I have read the rules to advice and hope that I have followed them correctly.

I work for a company and I am the only female (management role) besides a managing partner. I have been there roughly 9 months and from the start encountered issues with male employees undermining my requests.

Additionally, I share an office with him and have asked that he keep his side clean. We have actually had an ant problem do to him leaving dishes on his desk, and we have lost important information because he places it in the mounds of randomness that has taken hold of his desk. I have spoken to the managing partner concerning his cleanliness. At first she addressed it but as time has gone on she has resorted to ‚Äúyeah, it probably won‚Äôt happen.‚Äù As I am writing this, I understand that leaving will most likely be the best option.

Dealing with body hair,"Hey gang!

I need help. I‚Äôve been going back-and-forth when it comes to my hair confidence. I am of Mexican heritage and my body is a lot thicker and darker than most of the people around me. I‚Äôve grown out my hair for multiple weeks, occasionally even a couple of months, and felt good about it; really good about it. 

No matter how long I go and how proud I am of my beautiful hair, there is always something that makes me feel that I need to shave. I realize that I haven‚Äôt really gone into public without shaving and I‚Äôm scared of being made fun of, but I also want to help other people by motivating them and showing them that it‚Äôs possible. 

Any advice or personal stories of how you overcame this feeling?

Edit: I originally opened with ‚Äúhey boss bitch gang‚Äù which is something that I take as a token of defiance against the original use of the word bitch.

Is it inappropriate to note someone's pronouns before using them if you think they would cause confusion?,"There is a person in my extended social circle who uses he/her pronouns.  This can cause a modest amount of confusion for people who don't usually interact with him, as when we talk about her and he goes from the subject to the direct object of a sentence, people think that the ""her"" we are referring to is a different person.

This has lead to a weird situation in which we've found it helpful to clarify the ""he/her pronoun"" situation before talking about this person, but others have objected saying that it's kind of rude since we would never go out of our way to mention someone else's pronouns instead of just using them naturally.

I know feminist circles tend to have a good sense of the best practices with regards to pronoun usage, so I was wondering if anyone here has come across a similar situation, and if so, how did you approach it?",1

""I am happy to announce that we have been fined,"" Hidalgo told a city council meeting, adding she had been filled with ""joy"" when she learned of the penalty.

**Hidalgo said she was faulted because 11 women and only five men were named to management positions in city hall in 2018, meaning that 69 percent of the appointments went to women.**

""The management of the city hall has, all of a sudden, become far too feminist,"" laughed the Socialist, who was re-elected for a new term at the helm of Paris last year. According to the text of the ruling cited by Le Monde daily, city hall violated a rule dating to 2013, which stipulates said one sex should not account for more than 60 of nominations to management positions. Hidalgo said that she would take the cheque for the fine to the government in person, along with her deputy mayors and all the women working for her.

Taking a more serious tone, she added: ""Thi**s fine is obviously absurd, unfair, irresponsible and dangerous**"", adding that women in France should be promoted with ""vigour because the lag everywhere in France is still very great"".

""Yes, **to one day achieve parity, we must speed up the tempo and ensure that more women are appointed than men**,"" she said",1
Is Toy Story a good allegory for the loss of privilege?,"I know it isn't a perfect 1-to-1 because ultimately Andy is trading one masculine symbol for another buuuut in regards to Woody it seems actually pretty fitting. He's in an unchallenged position of leadership. when the move is happening he points out that he isn't worried about being replaced or abandoned therefore others shouldn't be  and it is rightly pointed out that...no shit Woody has no reason to be afraid. He's Andy's favorite. He is the basis and hero in all of Andy's stories. The other toys are but a part of his story and their importance is only in relation to how much they serve that purpose. He gets more representation than anyone else as Andy's room is full of his merch. So he will naturally walk around secure in the knowledge that he'll be okay. 

Enter Buzz who suddenly becomes the new toy on the block. Woody gets played with less and when he does it's in service to Buzz's story. Andy's room is redecorated to a new aesthetic that is in direct contrast to the old southern wild wild west. More people are excited to listen and defer to Buzz. Woody still has authority but it's not nearly as prevalent and it drives him up the wall. He's no longer special. He's ""just another toy""  

Strange things are happenin indeed. Just something I was thinking on. wondered if you agreed or if there's some flaw I'm not seeing. (as an aside, ""Woody"" and ""Buzz"" are pretty sus *toy* names. Had to get that off my chest too)",1

And men are different.  We need to compliment each other more.  I tried to this once, but all I got were odd homophobic ramblings.

All of this is assuming perfect strangers or at least no extenuating circumstances like bosses or anything inappropriate.

What's your view of single-sex schools? Why are they legal?,"Hi :)

I'm from the UK and we have many more same sex schools than across the pond, but I've never really understood why tf we have them. I've always hated them -  there not representative of the real world and your at risk of producing some really weird personalities that are alienated from the real world (particularly private same-sex schools) - and I've always assumed that feminists hate them too, given feminism is all about sex equality. It's weird because it's literally segregation so I don't really see a moral case for them, but I'd really like to know if there are any feminists (or anyone at all, for that matter) who genuinely agrees with them. And what's really baffling to me, is how they are legal?? In the UK, we have the Equality Act 2010, which reads  'A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if, because of a protected characteristic, A treats B less favourably than A treats or would treat others. '  Now if I'm not wrong, don't same-sex schools do literally what's described there e.g I can't go to an all-girls school because I'm male, and sex is a protected characteristic so...? I know in the US you have your constitution, and surely US same-sex schools (albeit the small amount) are unconstitutional - 'all men (bit dodgy, but I'm interpreting it as everyone) are created equal'. So, particularly any lawyers out there, how are they legal/constitutional? Is there an exemption or some weird loophole?  


I'm genuinely interested in any answers to both of my questions, so any responses would be much appreciated :) Thanks",1
Some advice about how to deal with men purporting to be feminists.,"I‚Äôm close friends with a woman whose husband has been physically, emotionally and sexually abusive for the vast majority of their relationship. To meet the man, you‚Äôd never suspect he‚Äôs capable of such awful things, he‚Äôs charming and funny, most people seem to like him. 

He‚Äôs also a vocal supporter of feminism and likes to tell anyone who‚Äôll listen how progressive and open minded he is. 

What I‚Äôm curious about is if anyone has had similar experiences, and how you‚Äôve  decided to deal with that? 

Is it common that people might profess such liberal views publicly, and act against them so disgustingly in private?

what should I do if I recently realized that I disagree with a lot of what feminists say?,"I usually would think about myself as being a democrat, even a socialist, and agree with many liberal ideas. But, deep in my heart, I do not agree with much of what feminists say, even though I say nothing about it, it is still strong enough to vote the other way.

It is not because I have not been self critical, or have not reflected about my own biases.

I disagree about the full spectrum of what privilege means, and I cannot find myself upholding standpoint epistemology. I take on my own emotions, and I have gone to therapy.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, I am saying that, even after deep introspection, I do not agree with many points in feminism beyond these ideas, but that is not really the point. My question is, how does feminism address the existence of someone like me?

edit 2:

I am asking whether it is even possible to give the benefit of the doubt. whether democracy can work. I am questioning standpoint epistemology. I am wondering if communication is possible.

I do not want to get into the arguments. because, this is besides the real point, and I don't want to get into people flinging trauma at each other either. the point is, I am introspective. I am educated. I have gone to therapy. But I disagree.

It is a problem I myself am wrestling with. a problem of commensurability. a problem of censorship. a problem of being able to participate in civic space.

What is the response to this? Because if we can't figure this out, and we go on as we are, in society... water wars, will not just be between india and china.

I want to be on the side of democracy. But it seems as though it is not working. as with Kalithecat's response, I think it was Simone Veil that said something like ""recognition is the rarest form of compassion""

nobody has even addressed the problem with standpoint epistemology. ",1
How do I deal with my ex wanting to date women?,"Hello, I identify as male with he/him pronouns, and a few months ago my ex broke up with me because she felts like she wanted to start seeing women. It was certainly difficult to leave, but if that's what makes her happy than I support her efforts. You only have one life, right? However, as time went on I've felt sort of scared of the idea of seeing her with someone else. I know that we're over and she wants to explore her sexuality and all this stuff, but I keep thinking of scenarios where we would hang out, and then she'd find someone, and it would be very awkward. I'm scared this awkward feeling is homophobia. If she were to start dating a woman, I'd think it would be hard for me to get used to the idea right away. I've never had a problem with people who have sexualities outside of the heteronormative practice, nor ever felt any animosity towards them. And I still love my ex very much, as both a human being and my best friend. I keep vacillating between whether my feelings are valid or not, and if they are prejudicial in nature. I keep wondering if its a result of implicit bias that makes me uncomfortable. If this is a case of homophobia, I want to do whatever it takes to get over it because I still want to be her friend, no matter the workload and harsh truths that I will have to go through. Its difficult to know their is a prejudicial side to myself, but I know prejudices can be overcome and my relationships will be much more closer because of it. I just find it difficult to accept my ex being with someone else while I still would like to be her friend. How should I think about this situation, and what can I do?",1
Slut-shaming other women - how do you react?,"A short backstory: Recently I have watched some videos on YouTube why feminism is still needed. I have been always aware that women around the world are treated unequally. However, as a young teenager living in Europe, I somehow though that there is no discrimination towards women in my country, at least in my environment. Oh boy, I was so wrong on so many levels.

But what recently caught my attention was how people treat women who are promiscuous. 

The first time that I really thought about this aspect was when I was around 16 years old. There was this ‚Äúconservative‚Äù female friend who was telling me about party she went to during weekend. She simply slut-shamed one girl just ‚Äúbecause she went with a random boy alone to the bedroom‚Äù. I really felt that what she said was inappropriate and disrespectful. Firstly, she didn‚Äôt know what they were doing. Secondly, it‚Äôs still none of her business. And thirdly, she named this girl ‚Äúa whore‚Äù while not mentioning the boy at all. Back then I couldn‚Äôt really understand why I was so upset by her words. Now I know it is the fact that she used such words to describe other girl, only because she potentially could have made out with someone. 

What is even more worrying, I know many girls from my school who claim themselves to be feminists and to fight for women‚Äôs rights. The problem is their attitude towards other females who are promiscuous. I‚Äôve heard many times as they said -  ‚Äúshe is slutty‚Äù or ‚Äúshe‚Äôs whore‚Äù. As long as you don‚Äôt do harm to the other person (meaning someone didn‚Äôt force themselves or didn‚Äôt cheat on somebody), I don‚Äôt understand the need for calling other women in such way. 

Two year later, I remember being on parties in which there was a particular boy who liked to flirt with other girls. Each time there was a party, he would get drunk and try to make out with someone. I didn‚Äôt think of it much as I believe it is none of my business. However, several weeks after one party he told how one girl was slutty (she and him were only kissing each other). I laughed in my mind because I couldn‚Äôt believe what he had just said. It was fine for him to call a female in a harmful manner, while he‚Äôs doing the same thing on every party. It was sheer hypocrisy, and this was the moment that I realized women are certainly not treated the same way that men are, even in those smallest aspects of social life. 

No one would call a male being slutty but rather as a player etc. Somehow for males being promiscuous equals to being successful (and btw I think that it‚Äôs toxic too). But when a female is promiscuous, she is described with extremely negative words. It is worrying that not only males make such comments, but women too, even though we are supposed to support each other. 

I have questions to you. Have you experienced situations in which promiscuous females were treated or talked in a negative way? How did you respond? How do you react to people who talk this way?

I think this issue is quite important because calling a female ‚Äúa slut‚Äù can drastically changer her change, especially for teenagers who are entering some part of adulthood.",1

I would like to add these are cases in which the joke/ remark actually was offensive, rather than grey area. 


I see two issues:

1. Possibly women not being honest with male friends / family members and claiming to be okay with things they aren‚Äôt okay with. 

2. The unfortunate belief that a women can‚Äôt be a misogynist or sexist because she is a women. 

I wonder if the men using these excuses genuinely believe ‚Äúoh a women has said it‚Äôs okay therefore it is‚Äù, or if it‚Äôs just that, an excuse that sounds more credible, a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù?

How to change parents views on their daughters? (I am male homeroom/science teacher),"So I have been working in a girls-only school for the last three years.

Shouldn‚Äôt masturbating / fantasizing about someone require consent? [LONG READ],"A NOTE ON CONTENT: Nothing sexually graphic is mentioned, though there is discussion of sexual activities and consent. 

**TL;DR - When someone other than yourself is involved in a sexual act with you, that other person must provide consent. Masturbation is a sexual act. Masturbation fantasies involve a person other than yourself (albeit indirectly) in the sexual act of masturbating. Since there is another person involved in a sexual act, shouldn‚Äôt that person give their consent to be masturbated to / fantasized about?**


Full disclosure: I‚Äôm a cishet male. My own understanding on consent is limited and still growing, and I think this is one of the best places to ask. If there‚Äôs other places on Reddit or the internet that such a question would be better directed, please let me know, and I apologize in advance if I‚Äôve crossed any lines. 


EDIT: I‚Äôve looked at other posts on this subreddit and just thought I‚Äôd clarify this from the start: I‚Äôm not talking about masturbating to photos or videos of people but just fantasizing about them to yourself. Masturbating to pictures, if those pictures were not taken with the explicit intention of providing a template for sexual fantasy, is an act of objectification and is thus inherently demeaning. My question just regards fantasizing and masturbating to oneself, no pictures or any other materials present, and the extent that consent should apply. 

With that said:

[Healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/health/guide-to-consent#what-is-consent) has, what I think to be, a sufficient definition of consent, that is ‚ÄúConsent is a voluntary, enthusiastic, and clear agreement between the participants to engage in specific sexual activity.‚Äù 

Further, I understand masturbation to be an inherently sexual act (and I think others would agree with me on this stance). 

Masturbation is also an activity that often, if not always, leads to fantasizing about someone in a sexual manner. Because masturbating is an act of self-stimulated orgasm, by definition, the person being fantasized about during masturbation not be *directly* involved in the act itself. That is, the person being fantasized about is not physically causing nor stimulating the orgasm. **However**, they are still *involved* in the act, are they not? Their involvement is indirect, in the form of being fantasized and thought about during masturbation, rather than physical involvement, but it‚Äôs involvement nonetheless, right? 

**With that in mind, since masturbation is a sexual act that involves another person, shouldn‚Äôt the other person have to consent to be masturbated to / fantasized about (as per the definition of consent)?**

I‚Äôve read stances along the lines of ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre masturbating to them, then it‚Äôs alright.‚Äù But then again, what if someone were masturbating to someone else in a public space, without the subject of the masturbation knowing they were in the center of someone‚Äôs fantasy? Though the person doesn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre being masturbated to, surely such an act violates consent since the subject‚Äôs lack of awareness of the situation prevents any consent from being given?

Now, I‚Äôd just like to personally add that I‚Äôm asking tjis question because I‚Äôve masturbated to both people I know, and celebrities that I find attractive. Yet, regardless of if I know them or not, I do not want to deprive them of their consent, even if they don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm masturbating to them. I try not to masturbate to any pictures that I find on the internet, as most of the time such images were not taken with the intention of providing a source of sexual fantasy, and I don‚Äôt want to reduce their identities by disregarding the photo‚Äôs intent and looking at it only in a sexual light. Any fantasizing is kept to myself, though, again, even if it is kept to myself, I don‚Äôt want to deprive anyone of consent with my actions. 

Thank you for reading and any an all responses are appreciated.

EDIT 2: To be honest, I was expecting this to get no comments. So even the few I‚Äôve received I‚Äôm very grateful for, and all with incredible insights. Thank you all!",1

Misuse of verbage.,"Why is it that on most pages or posts involving feminism, the terms misogyny, sexist, oppressed, etc. are all used either incorrectly or simply as an attack on any males who dont agree?    (Im not saying all feminists are like this, i just tend to see alot of them).",1
Are the events of 2020 throwing us into the fourth wave of feminism?,"As far as I understand, basically: first wave is suffragists around 1910-1920, second wave is around 1960-1970 with the womens lib movement, third wave is 1990s(ish?) with more intersectionality, and the only thing ive heard about fourth wave is that its pretty much the same as third wave but with social media? 

At first I thought if its the same how does adding social media make a whole new wave when we already had the internet when the third wave started? I know social media has had a strong affect on our society both good and bad. Is it because of the #s? #metoo and #blm are obviously very important in as historical social movements

But now in 2020 we are kinda forced to use only internet based/social media platforms during quarantine? So Im thinking that fourth wave might be a more relevant label for whats happening currently after coronavirus.

I also want to acknowledge the fact that I'm in the US, my historical knowledge and current situation is based on that. In other countries apparently its like the pandemic never even happened haha.",1
Where to stand on women that men cheat with?,"To me personally, if the woman didn‚Äôt know, then the man who cheated is definitely solely to blame.  If she knew, then I go as per the saying ‚Äúit takes two to tango.‚Äù  As the saying literally means that-they both dug their grave.  

Blaming *only* the woman (or multiple women) in either instance while letting the man who cheated off scot free is no doubt internalized misogyny (hello Cardi B).  However, despite that being the common case for long, I am at odds with the idea that the woman a man cheated with should be scot free even if she knew because she didn‚Äôt owe the man‚Äôs gf/wife a commitment.  I‚Äôd argue she still owed the gf/wife basic decency/courtesy and empathy/consideration.  

I also don‚Äôt believe feminism means excusing selfish behavior of individual women.  Plus, in instances where the gf/wife knew the other women well, it‚Äôs understandable that she feels betrayed by both her bf/husband and the other woman.  In my experience, women who knowingly engage in affairs with other women‚Äôs bfs/husbands tend to have the most internalized misogyny along with all other sorts of bigotry (personally my own stepmother is a prime example).  

I‚Äôve seen different feminists have different views on this, so I‚Äôd like to see where the feminists of Reddit stand.",1
"What do Feminists think of the ""Silver Bullet""?","What is the, ""Silver Bullet?""

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I guess that answers that question. Feminist would rather ignore the problem and claim anyone suffering from sexism in the divorce industry is biased themselves. Cool. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It goes like this: At the inception of a divorce, one parent falsely accuses the other of abusing them or their children and claims they believe it will happen again. Depending on the country and jurisdiction, it might only take an affidavit of a couple of pages. No evidence or corroborating witnesses are needed, due process be damned. Now the police will arrive and haul the targeted parent out of the matrimonial home with protective orders, offering scant access to immediate legal recourse. What he or she says in their own defense is rarely of any significance. From this point forward, they are unlikely to see their children again for days, weeks, months, and sometimes [years](https://vancouversun.com/news/crime/father-seeks-justice-after-sons-abduction?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR2ng_h5Uz8DUA4LW0zbm0zgETve6uAIHrEUtcnHl60BFD1gyRymhbM7fwA#Echobox=1554675661).

Is Grayson a non sexist way of doing power fantasy/spy fiction?,"Hey I want to write a spy story and most of my influences come from Bond.  And I'm kinda realizing how problematic that is.  But I've recently read Grayson which I'm thinking I can draw from a bit less problematicly?


Like the issue with Bond is:

The use of Bond Girls as just eye candy with no characterization 

His treatment of said women 

The lack of female rep until like Quantum of Solace

The racist and homophobic caricatures of the villains ect.

Probably some transphobia there too

Alot of imperialism 



I dont think Grayson has any of that and hope to God I dont write any in, but is it a better place to draw spy fiction from, especially escapist spy fiction.

Also the sex between characters is that better suited?

Like what's a better way to write no strings sex or a better view of sex in spy fiction in general?

Thank you for the time.",1

Arguments to support believing victim.,"My high school had a MeToo recently. Many boys getting called out did not sit well with most of the male population. Their foremost argument, as always, was that anyone can make allegations without evidence. Most of the posts were self anecdotal cases. There were a few anonymous posts as well where someone would send first or second hand accounts, the poster will label them as such. While discussing the whole thing with my friends, the arguments that I brought up for believing the victims were:

*  No. of false allegations as a percentage is so small you can ignore it, especially if you take into account the number of cases that go unreported.
* You can't prove a lot of cases as there is no hard evidence but that doesn't mean the victim is lying. I gave the analogy that if I'm alone with one of you and I hit you hard without leaving any marks. You go complain to the authorities, who ask for evidence which you can't provide so you're obviously lying. Do you see the issue? How difficult it is to always produce evidence? Then there's also the mishandling of evidence.
* Victims have a lot to deal with when calling someone out. Recalling might trigger unpleasant memories. They have to face societal pressure. They are slut shamed. They are called liars and attention seekers. They are gaslight. They got more to lose than gain by falsely accusing someone for personal benefit so highly unlikely someone will suffer all that.
* ""Anyone can bring up an allegation against me"" To which I said, if you haven't done anything, you shouldn't be worried. Nobody has falsely accused me or you guys means they aren't on some sort of agenda to defame all men.

After a few posts, anonymous posts were stopped as the authenticity of such posts couldn't be completely determined and a few doubtful cases did slip in so the girls said they won't be taking anonymous posts, even though it does silence those who want to remain anonymous, as they can't do due diligence. These cases were used to bring up the whole false allegations argument and counter victim having to lose as they were behind a virtual wall now.

1) What other reasons can I provide to further bolster my argument? If anyone of the reasons I provided above are problematic, please explain how to correct them.

2) What are your views on anonymous posting? Should they have continued to be allowed despite the authenticity issue? 

3) Many boys argued that judgement was already passed without allowing the accused to defend themselves. Should the accused be allowed present their defence? 

4) In some cases, the accused provided very private conversations and digital evidence in their defence. Many argued that is a violation of privacy of the victim, while others said the accused have a right to defend. Views on this (I personally agree with the former)?

5) Extending (4), there was one particular case where a guy was accused on an all girls group but the whole student body got to know about it. He posted above type of evidence in the bigger group. The argument against this was that since the victim never posted on the bigger group, he shouldn't have either. His defence was that doesn't matter as everyone already knew by then. Can his reason be justified?

6) A bit unrelated to the post, but I read that we should call victims, survivors instead. I have seen the use of the term 'victim' here, so what to understand if it's okay to use it?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, please suggest some reading materials related to the MeToo movement, to understand it from the victim's perspective.",1
"The danish law against FGM is much harsher than most other countries, in that it bans any type of labiaplasty even on consenting adults. The argument for this is to protect FGM caused by coercion and social control, but is removing the right for all women a reasonable approach?","Hi again. I'm the one who asked [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/kcfpd0/denmark_is_currently_considering_a_ban_of/) and the great responses made me think of this other potential issue as well.

I apologize that one of my sources will have to be in danish, but it seems like google translate does a decent job at turning it into English.  
The law I'm talking about is [this one.](https://danskelove.dk/straffeloven/245a)

As it is now it de facto makes it illegal to make any sort of [labiaplasty](https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/blog/what-is-a-labiaplasty-and-what-does-it-involve) on women in Denmark regardless of their age and ability to make an informed consent.

Allegedly there is a sort of loophole in that it is somewhat easy to get a  medical certificate from your doctor to get it done anyway, but this requires you to go and say that you feel either physically or emotionally impaired by your genitalia.

It's also important to point out that even without this law, FGM would still be completely illegal due to other laws against mutilation, which also would prevent anyone from getting their testicles or hands cut off regardless of their age and claims of consent.",1

Interrupting Harassment,"I'm a white man in the USA and slightly larger than the average american man (whether or not this matters, I'm not sure).

Getting married/Having a child as a feminist?,"Hi all,

I am a feminist with a radical leaning and also an environmentalist. I am in my early 30s and about to get married (humanist elopement) to my SO. I never dreamt of getting married nor having children, even before I identified as a feminist. I am still not 100 % sure about why I am getting married as I am also not religious (surprise, surprise) but I guess it's because my partner asked and I am willing to make this commitment to him. I am not taking his last name though.

As mentioned I have almost zero desire to have kids. Pregnancy, child birth, losing my independence, climate change, feeling like I'd be conforming to patriarchal ideas of what it means to be a woman etc.  just make me extremely reluctant to having a child. But then there is a tiny part that thinks what if I'll regret it? It doesn't help that historically I am the kind of person who just really hates conforming and likes to rebel - the more people talk to me about having children and how that will give me purpose and meaning (I have an extremely purposeful and meaningful career and helping the planet is more important to me than perpetuating my genes), the more I will dig my heels in.

I am aware that feminism is about giving women the choice to do what they feel is best and I rather dislike the fact I am so antagonistic toward motherhood.

So feminists of r/askfeminists what are your feminist perspectives on motherhood and reproduction?",1
"The ""divorce financially destroys men"" myth - where did it come from?","I still see the idea that divorce financially ruins men (and the implication: it doesn't hurt women) come up *a lot* despite the data showing that [men are financially better off after divorce than women are.](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/25/divorce-women-research) People seem to treat it as some sort of conventional wisdom without any evidence to support it. To be honest, divorce sucks for a lot of people, but the financial aspect does not disproportionately impact men; the opposite is true. 

So where do you think this whole trope comes from?

Oh, and the other thing that's always thrown around: ""The man loses half of his stuff in divorce!"" Like... that's not how it works. Joint assets in the marriage are divided. Not just ""his stuff."" Not just ""her stuff."" It's like some men fail to see marriage as a partnership at all.

I am misogynist for stopping my gf from meeting certain men?,"The reason I chose to post this question here rather than an advice subreddit is that I want to understand if my thinking stems from misogyny, which I doubt I'll be able to understand there.

To give you some context, my gf is a very friendly and kind women. She manages to see good in people who don't even deserve an ounce of kindness. Over the years, I've stopped her from going to some events, like going out for drinks with co-workers where no other girl is present, and meeting certain guy friends/co-workers alone.

The reason behind this isn't that I'm insecure, there are a few guy friends of hers that I can blindly trust to not hurt her. Even if they have feelings for her doesn't mean she feels the same and will end up cheating on me. I don't fear her catching feelings for someone else, if that's going to happen then though luck for me but the mature thing is to accept that people fall out of love and forcing someone to love you is toxic. Besides, since I love her, I'd want what makes her happy, not miserable.

I tell her not go to these things or meet these men for her safety. Given how rampant harassment and violence against women are, I fear her getting hurt. Even if she takes care of her self, these men can take advantage of her, spike her drink, force her, physically overpower her. I don't stop her from going out in general, even if at night, or even with some guys I trust as I aforementioned. I won't say the only way to stop harassment/violence is to not go out, that's not a solution. It's just better to avoid certain people you think can hurt you. Moreover, it's just certain men that I think are creepy that I don't want her meeting alone, heck, I'd trust strangers more. I'd be okay with her chilling with them if, say, I am around or some of our trustable guy/girl friends are.

I don't forcibly stop her, ~~I just tell her not to go and she listens~~ (I tell her these people aren't good based on the evidence I give for the claim. She agrees with how that is indeed bad. I am well aware she can go if she wants to and won't stop her.

Recently I was explaining the same to a friend of hers who said that my reasons stem from a misogynistic way of thinking as I am another guy trying to control his female partner.

Edit: correct title should start with ""am I"". Currently it looks like I am been sarcastic.

Edit2: changed some wording which made it look like I was commanding her.

Edit3: I am going to set away now. Despite my post not being able to properly explain what I was trying to say, I did see some issues being highlighted in the comments that I was missing. I will reflect on those. Thank you for your responses! ",1
Question regarding boundaries and other people's kink,"I was just reading a post on AITA about a girl whose mother would wear a BDSM collar and call her husband ""Sir"" in front of her throughout her childhood, and the mom recently informed the daughter (20) that this was part of a Dominant/Submissive lifestyle. The daughter was repulsed to learn about her parents kink and felt that her boundaries have been violated. Most of the commenters were calling her an asshole for kink shaming her mom. 

I don't know how I feel about this situation because to me it seems like the parents were exposing their child to  their kink without her consent, especially after the daughter found out the signification of the collar and express extreme discomfort with it. That being said, some commenters were comparing it to a wedding ring, saying the kink is not inherently sexual. I'm wondering what you guys think is the line between respecting people's boundaries, vs respecting people's freedom to express their lifestyle.

(I know this isn't a specifically feminist issue, but since sexual consent is often discussed here I thought I'd ask)",1
How can a guy convince his fiancee not take his name?,"So, I have a buddy who is engaged to be married and he believes that it is oppressive a woman to take her husbands name. 

He feels strongly about it and im not sure that there's anything that can change his mind on the issue.

The problem is that his fiancee absolutely wants to take his last name and is offended by the suggestion that they should each keep their family names. Apparently, she had a mug custom made with the words Mrs. [His name] printed on it. 

From my understanding, she is a die hard feminist. So it's super confusing that she would want to take his name. 


Anyways. I can't seem to come up with any arguments for why they should keep their own names besides the ones that he has already offered to her. 

He doesn't like the history of the practice and what it represents. I've suggested that he offer to take hers but he likes his last name and doesn't want to change it.  He's also is kind of a stickler for fairness and thinks that it is unfair for one spouse to take the others as it creates a ""Power imbalance"". 

I don't understand relationships in general. So I'm making the smart decision and looking to Reddit for answers lol

Any advice on how a man can convince his fiancee that it's not right for her to change her name to his?

Some questions.,"Is it okay to accept an engagement ring from a man which he has paid for? And to live in a house that is completely paid for by the man, and have the privilege to take the whole house in case of divorce. If the man also hires and pays for a housekeeper \[thereby eliminating the unpaid labor \] in that case isn't marriage a system only beneficial for women?

Then, are pre-nups offensive to women \[Statistically it is women who almost exclusively practice hypergamy, so only a small percentage of women would be richer than their males spouse\]?

If there are such extreme failings on part of men, why don't women start dating women and marrying women, since feminism says that sexuality is a spectrum? I mean, why spend so much time crticising and analysing things instead of becoming bisexual, nobody is stopping you from doing that now.  Also women would know how to pleasure other women better and since penetrative sex does not guarantee female orgasm, so wouldn't you be better off with a woman?

Also, why do you think asian countries don't care about feminism?",1
"Why should I not be offended by the statement ""I've got 99 problems and the white heteronormative patriarchy is basically all of them""?","My feminist sisters are frequently posting this sort of thing on their Facebook stories and news feeds and I am told that I'm not supposed to take this personally. Being that I am white, straight, and male, I don't see how I could take this as anything other than a personal insult.

Why don't we have stricter penalties for rape?,"Increasing prison time will bring down the number of rapes, as men will be more afraid of committing rapes and going to jail for a long time. I think some countries also have death penalty for rape? Some Islamic countries cut off arms or something - but they also oppress women so we should not follow them.

Also, I am curious about difference between rape culture and like murder culture? . Obviously like making punishment severe will bring number of rapes down, but can we completely eradicate it? \[Like even in advanced countries people still commit murder even if jail time is very high\].",1
"What, as a feminist, is your view on NSFW games?","I have found myself playing a lot of lewd/erotic visual novel games lately. I've realized that most of them are terrible, but there are a few that actually have a very fleshed-out story and interesting characters on top of the sexual content.

Diversity and Entertainment.,"I do not understand why people want to force diversity everywhere?  Like just recently with Netflix's Winx Club adaptation - they do not even look like teenagers. . Also other things too like Enola Holmes \[why ride on the coat tails of an already iconic character? Arthur Conan Doyle did not mention an Enola?\] Like create your own female detective or something instead of marring Sherlock Holmes legacy \[I think the Doyle estate have sued Netflix\]. 

Like, actors/entertainers are paid so much because they act in works of fiction that allow you to move away from the boring realities of life, so I think it made logical sense that so many people in the entertainment industry were extremely good looking. Because otherwise - why the hell would I pay money to look at people who look exactly like me and behave exactly like I am - I already am living that life.

I think the next step would be to pay fat salaries to the people graduating at the bottom of the class then, because if rewarding genetic gift of beauty is problematic, it would be hypocritical of human society to reward the genetic gift of intelligence?

Why does feminism require one to be anti-racist?,"All feminism says is that men and women should be treated equally. It says absolutely nothing about treating all races equally. Theoretically one could support slavery and still be a feminist, as long as they treat the black men slaves equal to the black women slaves, right? Of course, most people would consider such a person deeply immoral, but I don't see how their racism makes them less of a feminist.",1
Does intersectional feminism mean that conservatives like me aren't allowed to be feminists?,"I am a Trump/Brexit/Le Pen supporting type, and also very sympathetic to feminism.  But every time I read feminists online, they seem to keep saying that I'm not allowed to be a feminist, because you can only be a feminist if you believe in radical left-wing social politics, multi-culturalism, etc.

For German speakers, I refer you to this speech:

"" [Teresa B√ºcker √ºber eine feministische Zukunft | 05.02.2020 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyIs3UoUVs) ""

Literally the first line is, ""we can't have anything to do with the AfD or other right-wing parties"", and the general theme is that in order to be a feminist, you have to be left-wing.

This article describes French feminists disavowing Marine Le Pen, saying that she is not allowed to support feminism because she's a fascist:

"" ['We feel very close to her': can 'fake feminist' Marine Le Pen win the female vote? | Marine Le Pen | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/18/front-national-anger-marine-le-pen-female-supporters) ""

I believe that sexual abuse and domestic violence etc are evil and widespread crimes and want to support feminist campaigns against them, but I don't feel able to do so because feminists seem to say that you can't be against those things unless you also support open borders, amnesty for illegals, Remaining in the EU, BLM, anti-capitalism, etc.  So what does that mean?  Am I forbidden from being a feminist?

I think that this is really dangerous.  It seems to me very dangerous to link the campaign against, for example, sexual abuse (which I'm personally a survivor of) with partisan, sectarian politics like immigration/anti-racism - because this is simply a terrible human evil which, like slavery or child labour, every sane person in society should be against.  But it sounds like contemporary feminists demand absolute compliance with a radical left-wing way of thinking as a precondition for supporting any feminist campaigns, like opposition to rape culture and abuse (which is an issue which affects men, too).  So does this mean I can't be against rape?

So what does this mean?  Am I banned from supporting #MeToo because I'm a rightie?  Do I have to oppose equal pay for women?  It sounds like this is what you keep saying to me.",1

So, what is the right thing to do if you have to interact with someone who wears revealing clothes without offending them?
