Black men matter,"Now before you read the title and downvote, let me clarify something. Yes, I know that the male experience is not exclusive to black men. I‚Äôm a white guy myself. But the hardest hit group by the modern war on men is almost certainly black men. Think about most of the issues that negatively affect men more than women: disproportionate sentencing, capital punishment, police brutality, fatherless homes, false rape accusations, homelessness, homicide, suicide... the list goes on and on. These issues, be they societal or legal, are often exacerbated for black men. Take sentencing disparities for example. In the US, 1 in 111 white women are in prison. Meanwhile, 1 in 17 white men are in prison. Pretty bad disparity, right? Now get this: 1 in 3 black men are in prison.

What are the reasons for this? Well above all else, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs all about being perceived as a threat. Men are more likely to be seen as threats than women. I think the fine folks here understand that well. For black men, this issue is once again exacerbated. Nothing pleases a racist, misandrist judge more than seeing a young black man being ‚Äútaken off the streets‚Äù because he‚Äôs seen as a threat. And this perception also frequently manifests itself in the form of police homicide. It‚Äôs how a police officer can walk into a random, law-abiding citizen‚Äôs own apartment and [shoot him to death](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Botham_Jean) while he‚Äôs sitting on his couch because she thinks he‚Äôs an intruder. Btw, that police officer will be eligible for parole after just five years, and she‚Äôs currently appealing to have the murder charge dropped altogether. How‚Äôs that for ‚Äúmale privilege‚Äù?

Anyway, the point of this post is not to create division. Once again, I think that white and black men both experience hardships due to our sex. And I‚Äôm not trying to imply that every woman is racist against black men, or misandrist as a whole. My point is just that we should be aware of the experiences of our black brothers, and stand with them as they battle racial inequality in addition to misandry.",1,0

Have you guys ever faced discrimination from the healthcare system that you felt was because you are male?,"I was doing some research on healthcare discrimination recently, which is when certain groups of people do not receive the same diagnosis as other groups, or whose symptoms are not taken seriously, which could lead to further complications.

When I was researching, however, I noticed that it was mostly focused on discrimination that women face in the healthcare system, which basically boils down to them having a hard time being taken seriously by doctors and receiving wrong diagnoses or no diagnoses at all. Even wikipedia's article on ""Gender bias in medical diagnosis"" only talks about how men are taken more seriously than women.

When I read that, I was like ""wait, that can't be right..."" There is no way men are more privileged in the healthcare system than women. To say that would also imply that people take the emotions of men seriously, their problems seriously, or just overall giving a shit about the well-being of men in general, which society has proven time and time again that it does not.          

For me, personally, I broke one of my toes in a basketball game. Even though I could clearly feel that it was broken, and I told the doctors how much it hurt, they just simply thought I could tough it out with an icepack and some rest. Walking on it for several days after that made it even worse, to the point where I finally needed surgery that I might not have needed if they took it seriously in the first place. 

So I wanna ask: What forms of medical discrimination do you face in the healthcare system, such as doctors appointments, hospitals, or getting a diagnosis in a disease or mental illness. Can you tell that that discrimination was from the fact that you are male? Do you feel that issues pertaining exclusively to us men, such as testicular complications, testosterone problems, erectile dysfunction, or even kidney stones (yeah, I know women get them too, but men statistically get them at a higher rate).?         

For the sake of simplicity, lets not talk about male genital mutilation (ahem, I mean ""circumcision""), since we all already know how big of an issue that is.",1,0
Sexist Training in the workplace,"So I work for a very large global company. I was part of a training session that included a guest speaker who was a woman in a very senior role. It was a fantastic presentation, very insightful and forward looking.


In the Q&amp;A afterwards, an audience member decides to ask the ‚ÄúAs a woman leader...‚Äù question, which just ended up leaving a bad taste in my mouth.


The point this leader focused on was essentially ‚Äúwe allocated 30 mins for questions after my presentation. The first 6 questions asked were asked by men. Women wait to ask questions. So to women: don‚Äôt wait [good advice] and to those who tend to ask questions quickly, try waiting before speaking up.‚Äù

Do you think it‚Äôs possible that women are actually the perverts of society?,"How did men‚Äôs value come to be only what he can provide for a woman?

I think it‚Äôs funny cause this girl I was talking to who was super Christian was completely astounded at the fact that I wanted an emotional connection with my partner before having sex.

Men who believe that masculinity is toxic or harmful have lower self-esteem and worse metal health than men who embrace their masculinity as a good thing,"Psychology has historically done a poor job studying men and masculinity.  At best it strives for a one size fits all approach, and at worse it has tried to contextualize everything through the eyes of women and femininity.

In such a model, men are treated as if they were defective women.  The belief is that they suffer from mental health problems in part because they are men, or because masculinity has harmful or toxic elements to it.

It turns out though that men who adopt these beliefs actually have worse mental health than men who embrace their masculinity and see it as a good thing.  In addition they have worse relationships with women, with their families, their friends, and they engage in drug use and alcohol more often than men who reject this view.

Obviously this is just a correlation. But given the APA's [formal (and dare I say *toxic*) stance on masculinity](http://empathygap.uk/?p=2735), I think there are things that we're not looking at right now.

Men cry less because they deal with things differently than women, not because they're repressing their emotions. And those differences might be productive and healthy for them.

The key to better mental health for men might be a healthy respect for masculinity, not a shunning of it.  Instead of trying to redefine masculinity, we should work to understand it better, and offer better services for men based on an honest acknowledgement that men's and women's mental health might require different approaches.

Men are not ""defective women"", and treating men's mental health in that context does not seem to be working very well.

A few sources (with quotes):

&gt;The other dogma, Pinker argued, 'is that repressing emotions is bad and expressing them is good ‚Äì a folk theory with roots in romanticism, Freudian psychoanalysis, and Hollywood, **but which is contradicted by a large literature showing that people with greater self-control, particularly those who repress anger rather than ‚Äúventing,‚Äù lead healthier lives**: they get better grades, have fewer eating disorders, drink less, have fewer psychosomatic aches and pains, are less depressed, anxious, phobic, and paranoid, have higher self-esteem, are more conscientious, have better relationships with their families, have more stable friendships, are less likely to have sex they regretted, and are less likely to imagine themselves cheating in a monogamous relationship.‚Äô

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/apa-guidelines-men-boys.html

&gt;Further analysis using multiple linear regression found that men‚Äôs self-esteem was significantly predicted by older age, more education, and a greater acceptance of traditional masculinity. **Men‚Äôs mental positivity ‚Äì which is known to be negatively correlated with suicidality ‚Äì was significantly predicted by older age, a greater acceptance of traditional masculinity, and more education.**

https://zenodo.org/record/3871217#.X-p1ji2l2J_

&gt;When in distress, women tend to want to talk about their feelings whereas men tend to want to fx whatever is causing the distress (Holloway et al. 2018). **However our mental health services are delivered in a ‚Äúgender blind‚Äù way, so that treatment options that might suit men better are rarely considered (Liddon et al. 2017).**

https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_5

In addition, the APA has discovered that **""many men report experiencing gender bias in therapy""** and **""investigations have identified systemic gender bias toward adult men in psychotherapy""**.  So maybe if our mental health services viewed masculinity in a better light, men would receive better care.

Asking for advice in avoiding the wrong type of woman.,"So, being on this sub for a long time has given me a lot of paranoia regarding women. Specifically, avoiding them. I personally lack a lot of social skills, being a social outcast for most of my high school life and even in college. I have friends who were falsely accused of rape and had their lives ruined because of these allegations (one killed himself because he was completely ostracised, even from his family).

I have started living on my own in an unfamiliar environment and was wondering if there are general red flags to look for or just advice like that on avoiding the type of woman who would falsely accuse me of certain actions. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

Apparently men‚Äôs shoes are not a thing,"So I went shopping at Walmart tonight, to pick up a few things I forgot yesterday, and one of those things was shoes. I got to the shoe aisle, and noticed immediately that there was a designated ladies‚Äô shoes section, a designated kids shoes section... and that was it. There‚Äôs literally no men‚Äôs shoes section. Slightly annoyed at this, I figured they were probably just hidden against the back wall on the opposite side of the kids section from the ladies shoes. And they were. Kind of. There was three aisles of kids shoes, and two aisles of ladies shoes, and half a shelf of guys shoes. Except it got weirder. There was a small section (maybe a shelf or two) of men‚Äôs shoes surrounded on both sides by kids shoes. The rest of the men‚Äôs shoes were against the wall hidden in the back. Except wait a second. Why on earth is there a section of women‚Äôs boots smack dab in the middle? It‚Äôs on the exact other side of the shoe section from the ladies shoes. The heck is this? How painful are they going to make shoe shopping? I just want one decent pair of shoes. And the guys selection is so narrow that if it‚Äôs not freakin cowboy style steel toed boots, it‚Äôs classy dress shoes that you would like wear to a wedding. The heck happened to all the sneakers? Oh wait there‚Äôs one brand of sneakers with maybe three sizes available, even though the shelves are clearly fully stocked.

(Most) Gay men are on your side,"I'm a 29 year old guy. Been openly gay since I was 12. When I say gay, I don't mean a stereotypical  obnoxious, narcissistic attention seeker at ""pride"" (shame). I mean I am just a regular guy who happens to be into guys. If you passed me in the street, you would just think me any normal bloke and if you remain a regular associate of mine it's highly likely a few years before the penny drops and you realise I'm gay.

I want all of you to know that all men (and women in fact, but this is not about them) share the burden of the current social climate. I hate being lumped in with the ""gay community"" because to me it's gone so loopy and so far aligned with feminist/gender ideology that to be associated with it is an embarrassment. Please understand there are countless other gay men just like me who are the silent majority. We aren't all insufferable narcissists trying to join the coven. 

I've been in a stable relationship with my partner for 5 years now and we really do have the most wonderful, equal and loving relationship. Both of us are so aghast at the current state of ""liberal"" politics to the point we've resolved to eventually getting a place in the country and becoming self-sufficient so we can watch the world burn from afar.

Chicks can‚Äôt hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù,"So I made a huge life change about a month ago (got clean from drugs after a couple years of darkness, got my life back together and I would say better than ever). But this is besides the point, just some context. (24 year old male). 

Anyways, it seems that attractive women in town have taken notice and I am getting truly sought after for this first time in my entire life. (Working out, getting back in shape. Taking care of my hygiene like never before etc.) 

A girl was in my group for a bowling night with about 30 of us. It was calculated by her and her friends that I was in this particular group. We had a fun night, I was in no way pursuing her sexually, just having a good time. She asks for a ride home, I generously accepted. 

Outside her place she asks if I would like to come in for a drink. I calmly, clearly, and concisely explain to her that I really do like a different girl and explained that I actually had went for a few lunch dates with her. I explained how me going in for a drink would feel like cheating. (Which I had done in my past, no questions asked. Probably deep due to my addictions and total lack of confidence) 

The woman literally lost it. Screaming at me, yelling in anger. SLAMS MY TRUCK DOOR, hard enough to break the glass of the window. 

What the fuck is going on, are most women like this? Or did I just come across a full blown psycho ? 

Thanks for making it this far, sorry that I am ranting.

Toxic masculinity ruining men‚Äôs mental health. Sexual assault on men is serious too.,"I could write a whole book on this; mens rights, and toxic masculinity. But one thing that I do not understand, is the perception to many women I try and talk to (I don‚Äôt force these topics, this just happens when they come up) that I‚Äôm against women‚Äôs rights, and ‚Äúcan not say this because I‚Äôve never felt true oppression‚Äù. I‚Äôm not even saying oppression here. What I‚Äôm saying, is that I think rights should be equal across the board. Women‚Äôs rights does good things. BLM does good things. Many movements do good things, but supporting mens rights does not make me a fascist conservative. I look at many of the situations that have happened to me, and close friends of mine, and if you were to flip the genders, people would be in jail. For example, I, not my friend have been physically tied down, and raped. I mean I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5‚Äù, 200 something pounds. I do not need to be physically scared of that. But things that have happened to me is mentally manipulated into sex among other things. Said ‚Äúno I don‚Äôt want that‚Äù for them to be like ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok it‚Äôs ok‚Äù, or a girl berating me to her friends that I wouldn‚Äôt fuck her, so I gave in to things out of guilt. Or after things fall off with that person, and I am perceived as the bad guy because I could not live up to her sexual needs, and lose many friends over it. This is happening to a close friend of mine, and he has failed to see it. Everyone laughs when he tells people ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna fuck her but she makes me‚Äù. It‚Äôs funny, because he‚Äôs a guy. But it‚Äôs not funny. It can fuck you up. For 5 years I could not even think of having sex, and now, I still have a bad relationship with sex because I fear that something bad will come of it; that I‚Äôll become a bad guy because of it, or like I am a villain when I don‚Äôt want to have sex (god bless my girlfriend for being great with this). But I am normally laughed at for this. It is not taken seriously. My friend, does not take me seriously, yet is miserable in his situation. He won‚Äôt get out of it, because he‚Äôs been manipulated to think it‚Äôs ok (he now even knows it‚Äôs not ok but doesn‚Äôt know what to do). 

And there is toxic masculinity. These issues come up, and I‚Äôve heard girls tell guys to ‚Äúman up and fuck me‚Äù. Or when a guy comes out with these sort of issues, they are laughed at because ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a guy, you liked it‚Äù. Or when a man‚Äôs mental health is in shambles and they are told to ‚Äútoughen up‚Äù everyday, until one day they kill themselves. In October 5 people. 5 peers of mine, ranging from kids I coach, to a second father though out childhood of mine took their own lives. In one month. They cried for help, but we didn‚Äôt hear them because ‚Äúthey will tough it out‚Äù. I watched a man drink himself away, depressed, drunken and dying. Everyone saw he needed help, but no one helped him. He died in October too. What I want, is not to abolish women‚Äôs rights, I think they are meaningful. What I want is to be treated the same, and the mental (and physical) wellbeing of men to be treated the same as our female or non-binary peers. I know what the stats say. I know these sexual abuse cases are less common. But they do happen, and but they are not treated the same. 

We can be hurt too. We can be mentally hurt and scarred, but no one likes to recognize that.",1,0

Men can't say no? [YouTube: Mediocre Tutorials and Reviews],"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70UAAaOmKfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70UAAaOmKfY)

""My body my cho... oh, I forgot, I got a dick. I'm *supposed* to be the horny, perverted sex.""

I've been trying to make a list of all the things that a man could say no for, and it oddly fluctuates, though some are obvious:

* Not attracted
* Don't feel like it
* May be too good to be true
* In a relationship
* Faithful to a religion
* Scared of STDs
* Don't want kids or get trapped
* Masculinity or pride

Notice how some of these women seem to have been stuck in ""female empowerment"" echo chambers where they are taught they are *automatically* the most entitled of anything. Especially the aggressive ""yellow"" haired woman. Women want equality, but still reap the exclusive double standard benefits of being a woman, which are stronger than whatever privileges we are supposed to have, whatever they are.

I could lose my brother,"Hi guys, im in tears writing this as I just learned that my brothers ex has put an AVO out on him with the accusation that he stalked her, drove past her house and followed her in his car. My brother cut communications with this girl and even being near her causes him to hyperventilate badly and eventually have an asthma attack. No evidence has been presented of this happening as his ex's house has security cameras.   


My biggest worry is that if she wins and the AVO is out then she can say at any time that hes near her and the cops will pick him up and he goes to jail for 2 years plus a $5.500 fine no questions asked. Our town is extremely small which means he could be seeing our cousin while shes at Mcdonalds and he gets picked up because of the 100m radius on the AVO.  


This is my cry for help, I just wanan know what I can do as a 14 year old teen or atleast can someone give me some coping mechanisms so I'm not in tears everytime I hear this.",0,0

"Wikipedia labeling a football (soccer) player as ""sexual harasser""","So out of curiosity I decided to check the Wikipedia page of a football (soccer) player who plays for a club in my country (I saw the result of a match played recently).  
And while I was looking at his personal life where I saw a sentence that made me angry and dissappointed  
Quote:  He is the son of former international basketball player and inductee of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2019 Mohsen Medhat Warda. And he is a sexual harasser"". 

He is accused of sexual harassement from a woman who claims that he harassed her sexually via Snapchat. They never met in person (if they did she does not mention it at all) and the only communication was via Snapchat messages (everything according to her claims). 

If he did harass her let the court decide if he is guilty or not (she said she will show the messages to the authorities). 

It is just sad for men to be judged like that. You are accused of sexual harrasment and everyone is pointing a finger at you. You are guilty before the case even reaches the court. Œóe faced similar accusations in the past which resulted him being dropped from his national team pickings but later returned due to lack of evidence. Unfortunatelly for him when the manager changed, he did not participate again. It can cause a lot of damage in a player's career because he can easily be dropped from being a key player to being sat on the sidelines until this is over. Not just for his national team but for whatever club he plays for

I posted a link to the article so everyone can have a look. It is in Greek though (Could not find anything in English)  but the description basically says what I wrote here. It states her claims and that now a lot of women contacted her to say that he harrassed them as well. You can take a look at the images which contain her messages and her claims (these are in English).",0,0

Gender Differences in Suicide Prevention Responses: Implications for Adolescents Based on an Illustrative Review of the Literature," [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4377906/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4377906/)

This review considered a broad array of published and peer-reviewed research that evidenced gender differences in the effectiveness of suicide prevention efforts. Twenty-two studies evaluate common universal prevention programs as well as targeted programs were used.¬†

The main type of programs that are analyzed are: school-based prevention programs, community-based prevention programs and health-based prevention programs.

The results of this review point to the priority for tailoring prevention programs so that adolescents, a high-risk group for suicidal behavior, can maximally benefit. Currently, females appear to be the primary beneficiaries of several prevention efforts, while males more often exhibit deleterious effects from exposure to programming. Concerted effort is needed to promote strategies that will also benefit males. A fruitful direction may be to separately implement and administer programming to males and females. For hard-to-reach males, preference-based programming allows an element of independence.",0,0

Circumcision shouldn‚Äôt be allowed for consenting adults either.,"I always hear talk about how circumcision shouldn‚Äôt be allowed until 18 (or whatever the adult age is). However, allowing it at 18 is wrong for the following reasons:

1. If I went to a hospital and asked them to chop off my finger, they would refuse, and rightfully so. If a person wants a healthy part of them removed, they must be grossly misinformed into thinking that‚Äôs a good thing.

2. If (in western countries, presumably) an adult woman went to the hospital and asked for FGM, she‚Äôd likely be refused. Rightfully so. Why should MGM be any different?

3. Stemming from the first two points, there will be so much propaganda thrown to intact children to pressure them into making a horrible choice the moment they turn legal. Propaganda from adamant cut people who could no longer mutilate children at birth, propaganda from the for-profit medical industry that still wants its revenue...how much is a choice a choice at 18 if you‚Äôve been miseducated and brainwashed into making that choice? To me it‚Äôs not unlike the college and predatory loan situation in the US.

Surrogacy as a single man,"What's up men! Even though my mind is made up to remain single in order not to fall victim to marital laws, I'm certain I want to be a father.

If you're wondering why it's so cheap, I'm from a developing country and 10k is a whole lot of money over there. 

The problem I have now is that I feel a bit awkward for considering this option. I'm the first child(and only son) in my family as well as the first grandchild from my mother's family and ideally everyone would love to see me in a huge wedding paid for by family followed by a big ceremony for the birth of my first child. I know these ideas may seem weird to people in the West but it's tradition where I'm from. I guess what I'm asking of you men is to help me feel less awkward about going against my tradition and disappointing my family. Of course, I'll be an object of gossip amongst people in my community if I finally choose this path. I'm a Stoic and I can deal with all these but I would still like to hear words of wisdom from men here about why such an unconventional decision by me isn't awful just because it's not the norm and how I can remain fulfilled if I make this choice",0,0

Study: The Gender Gap in Sex Offender Punishment," 

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333518551\_The\_Gender\_Gap\_in\_Sex\_Offender\_Punishment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333518551_The_Gender_Gap_in_Sex_Offender_Punishment)  
When matched for age, race, prior offending, type and severity of offending, the study finds that:  
\-A substantially larger percentage of males receive prison than do females (47% compared to 33%, respectively)  
\-A substantially larger percentage of females receive probation than do males (42% compared to 34%, respectively)  
\-Male sex oÔ¨Äenders receive longer sentences than female sex oÔ¨Äenders. Males on aver-age receive prison sentences that are more than 20ÓÄû months longer than those assigned to females (102.9 compared to 81.4), intensive probation sentences that are on average 1.5 months longer (20 compared to 18.5), and probation sentence lengths that are on aver-age 5 months longer (62.7 compared to 57.).  
Male sex oÔ¨Äenders, all else equal, are perceived to be more dangerous and culpable than their female counterparts and so experience more punitive and incapacitating sanctions.  
But the study is too female empathic. Its conclusion try to find excuse for judge:¬†  
""these Ô¨Åndings do not support advocating for policies that ‚Äúeven the score‚Äù by becoming more punitive for females""  
And they go on on how maybe male offenders are really more dangerous, that male cannot be treated without prison or that women cannot be treated in prison (like all the feminist bullshits saying that prisons is not for women). They say all that without any proof. Instead of being concerned that female abusers are given a free pass, are in liberty while potentially dangerous and are not punished for their action, they prefer to protect female sex offenders. What is funny is that they were wondering about if they were going to find that women would be punished harsher. I wonder if their reacrion would have been: ""do not punish women lighter"" or ""policy should be immediately implemented to be faire toward women !"" ?¬†",0,0

Participants ( N= 423; 276 women and 147 men) read a vignette depicting either a couple having consensual sex (control), or a male or female aggressor who initiates sexual intercourse via verbal coercion, use of alcohol, or physical abuse. College students were provided with legal instructions of sexual assault then asked to pro-vide a verdict, degree of guilt, and legal components.

Ratings of guilt were lower when the aggressor was female compared to male. In addition, male victims were more likely to be perceived as providing consent and less likely to experience fear of bodily injury when the aggressor was female.


Male were aslo less likely to put the blame on male victims but I believe that they found that result because men and boys only learn that they are potential rapists, not potential victims.",0,0

Males offenders receive substantially longer sentences. These disparities are primarily generated by departures from the guidelines, rather than differential sentencing within the guidelines. Departures produce about 70 percent of the male-female difference. Meaning that it was not because of the context that this disparity exists (as feminists want us to believe) but because judges get out of their way to help women. Males are also less likely to get no prison term when that option is available; less likely to receive downward departures ; and more likely to receive upward adjustments and, conditioned on having a downward departure, receive smaller reductions than females.

downward departures: judges giving lesss than the minimum sentence

upward adjustments: Higher sentence than what is asked",0,0
"Study: The Determinants of Punishment: Deterrence, Incapacitation and Vengeance (drivers who kill women get 56 percent longer sentences)"," 

[https://www.nber.org/papers/w7676](https://www.nber.org/papers/w7676)

About murders:

""Male offenders receive a 6.2 year longer sentence than female offenders if the victim is female and a 6.9 year longer sentence if the victim is male. Killing a woman also results in a substantially longer sentence. For male offenders, killing a woman increases the sentence length by 4.2 years. For female offenders, killing a woman results in a 4.9 year longer sentence.""

Therefore if you are a male murderer, you are punished harder. Whatever you sex, if you murder a woman, you are punished harder.

About drivers who kill someone:

""In the Bureau of Justice Statistics data, the gap for male offenders between male victims and female victims is 5.1 years""

"Asking for Advice: Men over the age of thirty who experienced sexual violence or assault as a child, what are some things your partner can do to help?","So I wanted to ask after the experiences of men who sought help due to the experience of sexual assault or violence in their childhood. My (24f) boyfriend (38m) is a survivor of childhood sexual assault but he doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable talking about it, I only know that it happened when he was very young and it was his older brother who assaulted him. I don‚Äôt know where, exactly when or what happened and I‚Äôve never told anyone else. 

He very casually references his trauma in conversation as if it‚Äôs no big deal, an indicator I recognise as one of severe and unresolved childhood trauma. He says quite shocking things in passing like it‚Äôs all good and it‚Äôs nothing to worry about, but when I ask if he wants to explain more or discuss it with me further he instantly withdraws and goes quiet. 

I immediately believed him of course, and never questioned the validity of his experience. I‚Äôm always gentle and don‚Äôt try to prove him for answers. 

It‚Äôs not my right to know since it‚Äôs his story and I completely respect that. He told me the first time I asked that ‚Äúyou wouldn‚Äôt want to know what happened to me.‚Äù So I gently told him that it‚Äôs not about ‚Äúwanting‚Äù because nobody wants to know that kind of thing and how it happened to a child, but it‚Äôs about need, since I‚Äôm his partner and I love him I feel it‚Äôs important that he tell me things like that. But I‚Äôm not pushing, like I said, it‚Äôs his story and I followed up by telling him that it‚Äôs his life and when he decides I need to know is entirely up to him. I reassured him that it‚Äôs 100% ok if he decides that I never need to know. 

But I feel like this has impacted him heavily for a long time. He was in an abusive relationship for about 15 years and I suspect that his ex wife either didn‚Äôt believe him, belittled him for his assault, or he never told her. As a result, he constantly deals with thoughts of depression and struggled at the beginning of our relationship accepting simple acts of care and consideration. He never puts himself or his own desires first, in almost every regard. He works himself to the bone and almost never allows himself any free time. He often puts himself down, calls himself ugly and fat and overweight despite looking like a normal man his age and height. He feels he doesn‚Äôt deserve good things and has told me that‚Äôs how he feels about himself. 

So men who experienced the same thing and deal with similar feelings: what can a partner do to help?",0,0

why are femisnsts ( and most women who identify as feminsts ) so self centered and think women only deal with problems ?,"an example is  how women think that only the women in the middle east are oppressed which isn't true 

i have 2 middle eastern male friends they were SEVERLY physically abused like using electricity to shock them or using heated metal ( which is common in some places like Egypt ) and one of them LITERALLY  lost his spleen because of getting beaten  meanwhile female get only screamed at ( they are physically abused sometimes too but not as bad a men )

males are expected to go into good colleges and work extremely hard jobs ( as young as 10 ) meanwhile females stay at home which is bad but not as bad

female circumcision in the middle east is illegal male circumcision is legal and expected

also how they complain about beauty standards yet they fate men above 6ft only, they complain about domestic violence  1in4 men are victims of domestic violence and 1in3 women but 96% of perpetrators are males which proofs that women get away easily without any punishment, they complain about rape and when men complain about false accusations they are met with hate even tho the proven actual rape cases are 1.5% and the proven false allegations cases are 8-10%

Greatest Feminist Myth: Feminism is about equality of BOTH genders.," 

When you **google** feminism, this is what comes up :

&gt;Feminism¬†is a range of¬†social movements,¬†political movements, and¬†ideologies¬†that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and **social¬†equality of the sexes.**

This seems to imply that feminism implies **gender equality.**

OPEN THAT ARTICLE FOR FUCKS SAKE AND READ IT.

&gt;Feminism¬†is a range of¬†social movements,¬†political movements, and¬†ideologies¬†that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social¬†equality of the sexes.\[a\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]¬†Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the **male** point of view, and that **women** are treated unjustly within those societies**.**\[6\]¬†Efforts to change that include fighting against¬†gender stereotypes¬†and establishing educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and **outcomes for women that are equal to those for men.**

Feminism ASSUMES that women are below men and by bringing them up or equal to men they are achieving gender equality. **It is NOT PRIMARILY about helping BOTH sexes.** **It's GYNOCENTRIC.**

Why is Australia so pro-women without regard to equality?,"If any country refuses to acknowledge facts, it's Australia, India too.

The blind resume initiative is what led me to believe this. 

They wanted more diversity so they thought to remove names from resumes. They though managers were discriminating based on names therefore against women.

When names were removed, women were at a disadvantage. When names were added, they had more call backs...

So they said scratch this initiative which seemed very fair. We don't want to disadvantage women.

"""Locker room talk""... FOR WOMEN","***Let's hear some stories***

When the topic of ""locker room talk"" pops up, I'm sure you've heard a Feminist link that directly to ""toxic masculinity""---that BS Woke concept that implies certain behavioral traits are restricted exclusively to just one sex.

The truth is many men have heard the female equivalent of ""locker room talk."" That's what we're hear to talk about. For instance, how many of you have heard female coworkers talk about the following or similar to:

* all the things they‚Äôve *shared* \*cough\* on OnlyFans (plus all the money they make) and the people they‚Äôve engaged with and which ones they find attractive
* the women who share how they swoon over men in uniforms and how they just want to rip into them (can you imagine the reaction if a guy just announced he would walk up to a woman and rip her top off?)
* Which celebrities or coworkers they want to wrap their legs around
* the female managers who openly share what type of lube they think works best because it doesn't burn their vaginas (seriously, not only did she talk about that stuff with her coworkers, she's the type that acts all offended and ""professional"" if *you talk about sex* cuz that's a No-No)
* or the women who love to socialize with gay men in similar lewd conversations *in your presence* because, by their own admission, they feel safe to talk all they want about dicks with guys present

Yes, I've heard this type of chatter before in the workplace, and I'm sure many of you out there have heard all kinds of things.... ***so let's hear them. Share your best one(s), don't care how many you want to talk about.***

I know men can talk about boobs all day and say a bunch of things in locker rooms, I would just prefer if we stop pretending that one sex does this stuff just to justify their Woke beliefs that ""toxic masculinity"" is a real thing. So let's hear all the types of naughty things women talk about, often to casually and nonchalant at work, the office, or in the classroom -- the kind of things that would invite a hailstorm of Feminist stigmitizations if it was men talking about these things about women.",39,0

Having an argument in r/MensRights and suddenly a wild moron appears.,"Having a civil discussion on a post regarding consent laws. I stated that my opinion was that minors should be responsible for properly disclosing their age in order for a claim of statutory rape to be valid.

After a civil conversation with a couple of other members of the sub one person in particular seemed quite disagreeable and closed minded. u/anahawkinss disagreed with my statement quite passionately.

From askfeminists FAQ,"Why don't feminists care more about men's issues?

Feminism has mixed feelings about directly addressing men‚Äôs problems. Many feminists fear that addressing men‚Äôs issues, or ‚Äúgender issues‚Äù as a broad goal, will move the conversation completely away from women‚Äôs issues (remember, we live in a male-dominated society still). So instead they focus on women‚Äôs issues, and allow others to focus on their issues. Many feminists would like to see pro-feminist men tackle men‚Äôs issues in a way that doesn‚Äôt blame women and feminism for all their problems (see MRAs). Many feminists¬†do¬†care about men's issues, but demanding that feminists dedicate exactly 50% of their time and resources to such things is unreasonable. Please check out



As I've said, feminism isn't about equality for all, it's about equality when women have a disadvantage.

protecting a man with a security system,"I won't name any names in this, for obvious reasons.  Some years back, it was my job to help a man get his security system up and running, including cameras.  What was going on was he was recently divorced and had visitation rights with his 13 year-old daughter.  However, his vindictive and hateful ex wife was trying to destroy his visitation rights, and his relationship with his daughter altogether.

For those of you not familiar with security cameras, let me explain.  There are two basic approaches to making recordings.  1. You could have cameras that use motion detection to choose whether to record.  No motion = no recording, but if someone walks in front of the camera, it triggers motion and you thus get a clip that gets placed on the cloud.  The idea is to only record what's relevant.  There is no continuous recording.  2. Continuous recording to an SVR.  As the name suggests, this type of system records continuously and keeps the video saved to a hard drive on an SVR, a device similar to the DVR that you use to record TV.

So my job was to get this gentleman's cameras converted over from the motion-based recording system to a continuous SVR-based one.  His reason for wanting the change was simple.  His ex wife was falsely accusing him of molesting their 13 year-old daughter.  He felt the need to have positive proof that he was doing no such thing.  I knew for a fact he wasn't.  If he were doing that, the continuous video would prove that he was.  But he wanted the video system just to get the courts to believe him.  So much for innocent until proven guilty.  Of course, there are some rooms where you typically would not want to have cameras recording, such as the bathroom and the bedroom.  So his plan was to keep the door to the bedroom locked so that she could not go in there even if she wanted to.  Then if she went to the bathroom, he would stay in view of one of the cameras.

I felt bad for the guy, but I was glad to help him defend himself.  I also made sure to state that I'm not a lawyer, but rather a security specialist.  I could help him set up his system and learn how to use it, but I also strongly recommended that he speak with his lawyer to make sure that his strategies were sound.

I never did find out what happened with this gentleman.  Once my job of getting his system up and running was over, I was no longer in touch with him.  The security dealer was then taking over the monitoring of his system.

However, there is one thing I've noticed.  When I relay this story to let feminists know that, yes, false accusations are a real thing that sometimes can happen, they act hostile.  I've been accused of being a ""rape apologist"" for trying to help an innocent man defend himself.  I can only imagine the vitriol his lawyer must get.  The ""believe all women"" slogan is nonsense.  There is no group of people on this Earth that never lies and is never mistaken.  And just because I helped one man to protect himself does not mean I have any sympathy for actual rapists.

Another job I had was to set up an SVR and cameras for a high school teacher to use in his classroom, especially for when he did one-on-one consultations with his students.  He was an unmarried man like me, and was often met with unwarranted suspicion.  With cameras constantly rolling, he had the ability to prove his innocence if he needed to.  Those SVRs don't have unlimited space, btw.  They usually have a 1, 2, or 4 terabyte hard drive.  Depending on the resolution and the number of cameras hooked up to it, it will typically have something like 30 or 60 days worth of footage.  So I had to help the teacher set up a backup system as well, a RAID device that could hold a massive amount of data.  That way he could be protected if someone accused him of molesting them 2 years ago or something.  But even then, there was still the possible danger of footage getting destroyed in a disaster such as a fire or a flood.

What's very disturbing is the number of times I've had conversations with feminists about the importance of due process, and the fact that false accusations are real.  Most of the time, the feminist has shown no concern for the protection of innocent men.  It's baffling to me how some people will take my view that ""you need to protect the innocent from false accusations"" to mean ""I'm fine with women getting raped.""  I don't see any logical correlation to that.

Camera systems can help innocent men, but they have their limitations.  If their footage is lost, they can't protect you.  If the power goes out and any backup power runs out, they stop recording.  They also only protect in specific areas.  That man could only see his 13 year-old daughter in his own home where he knew he was protected.  So much for taking a father/daughter trip to a park or an amusement park or God forbid a road trip.

This is just a small sample of people I've helped with security systems.  This is getting long.  But suffice it to say, I've needed to help men in many more situations than the ones described here.  In my own life, I've also experienced people automatically assuming I'm some kind of predator.  People flipped out when I went to a national park with a DSLR camera and a long lens.  I was there to photograph birds, but people assumed I was some kind of perv who wanted pictures of their kids.

I'd doubt I'm the only one with stories like this.  These stories are real.  And I've got a bunch more.

TL;DR: I needed to protect a man from false rape accusations by using continuous feed security cameras.  ",15,0
I just wanted to share the opening post by the moderator of a new subreddit called r/TheManClan. I stumbled upon it by accident through a post on another sub. I figured there could be a lot of men on here that would love the idea of this sub as much as I do!,"As a member of the millennial generation, there are certain skills that we missed out on. This isn‚Äôt shameful, it‚Äôs a fact of life. Many of us have never cooked a steak, BBQ‚Äôd or changed our oil. Also, men don‚Äôt have the same support structure, are more likely to commit suicide, and are made to feel that help, therapy and support isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmanly‚Äù. This is a place for all of those things.

This is a place of positive support and a safe place for men to share their opinions, their fears, ask for help and ask for support. Any malice, verbal abuse or significant negativity toward other users or attempts to ‚Äústir the pot‚Äù will result in a ban.

Secondly, this is a free for all for ideas. You can post opinions and topics that relate to things that will or could improve someone‚Äôs life. These can include life advice, skill building, educational and thoughtful information, wholesome and positive memes, and challenges or topics of basic skills we should all have learned. For example, a challenge could be to cook a steak or change your cars oil. Simple things, easily acknowledged and things we should be able to do but might not be able to because of our generation.

Although this is the Man Clan and a space for positive support and building friendships, we will welcome women in need as well.

The patriarchy myth,"The patriarchy. We‚Äôve all heard of it. It‚Äôs a mystical society run by men which benefits men. The patriarchy that lets men be the largest majority of men living on the streets

This patriarchy is also responsible for the oppression of women for years according to feminism, however feminism fail to see that now, in the modern era, they are the majority.
This is why we see things like ‚Äòmanspreading‚Äô, ‚Äòmansplaining‚Äô etc. Women in the west are no longer oppressed, and so they seek oppression in an era in which, oppression is enviable.
Boys are taught from day one that they are dirty and disgusting, while girls are clean and immaculate in every way. Why do we ‚Äòempower‚Äô our daughters in exchange for the self confidence of our sons?

My Law class is sexist.,"I'm not one to preach the term 'sexist' easily. I understand the extreme nature of the term so I don't use it lightly. With that being said, I am currently attending Sixth Form in England (ages 16 to 18), and Law is one of my chosen subjects. My class has 3 boys including myself, and about 25 girls. I didn't mind this at first, okay, my radar for making friends is very slim, but maybe I can get along well with the girls or at least just get my head down and enjoy the course.

The teacher is female, important thing to note. Relatively young for a teacher, so she spends a lot of time each lesson talking to the girls about some recent album that's came out, or some inconvenience they have with putting some make-up on (this is not a generalised stereo-type based comment, they talk about this a lot) and everything else. Okay, I feel slightly neglected in the sense that I can't join in on these conversations, but if I had a male teacher who liked the same things I did, then I wouldn't hesitate to talk to him about football all lesson.

But when the actual class gets going, minor instances build up to me just feeling uncomfortable... The 'casual conversation' I mentioned between the teacher and students normally goes to talk about how lazy and irritating men can be sometimes, and how they would enforce a curfew if they could for men, and then at what times the curfew would start and they just start discussing a male-free utopia. Then they start talking about privilege.

All of this is amplified by the fact that often, in Law A-Level, the teacher will make up a story to help us understand a legal concept, so we need to apply the legal concept to the context of the story and see who is liable and all of that, in these stories, the victim will often be the female and nearly all of the time it is the Male that has been negligent of their child or abused their wife or mistreated female colleagues. It's never a woman committing the crime.

In addition, if the teacher is mentioning an actual case, she'll mention how some man killed his wife, and then a girl in the class will say something along the lines of ""That's shitty"" and then someone else will say ""Men are trash in general"" and all of these case examples and stories just feed into the narrative of the casual conversation and it creates a very toxic classroom environment. Finally, the teacher tends to commend the female students more, she'll never tell a girl that they straight up got the question wrong but she's very blunt to me whenever I get a question wrong. I'm not using this as my main point as this could be a coincidence but I'm just pointing it out.

I think this is the result of the teacher being slightly sexist and the ongoing 'men are trash' narrative that is trendy to preach if you are a teenager. A Law class of 95 percent girls gives the girls a perfect time to put men in a bad light and not reap consequences. I'm a 16 year old student and I just feel uncomfortable in my Law class. Thanks for listening, thought I'd provide some insight on classroom environment nowadays.",107,0

Today is an historic first for the office of Vice President of the United States,"You may have seen the journalists raving today about the historic nature of Kamala Harris being sworn in as Vice President of the United States.  These journalists are right, but for the wrong reasons.

The journalists are gushing about Kamala Harris being the first woman to become Vice President, but that is not actually her achievement.  She didn't earn that one.  Her actual achievement is being the first Vice President to be handed the job via affirmative action.  Instead of explaining the exact details myself, I will refer you to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/jt7bod/the_vice_presidency_is_being_handed_to_kamala/) post by a well-informed Redditor who explains the issue much better than I could.

So in short, we should celebrate Kamala Harris not as America's first female Vice President, but rather as the first affirmative action Vice President of the United States.  Always remember that she was handed the job for checking all the right boxes in a way that no other contender was able to do by the ""merit"" of the genetics she inherited by being born.  That is quite an achievement like no other.

Well done, Kamala.  Well done.",22,0

"There is a strong clinical need for discrete mental health and suicide prevention services for men and boys, without the feminist bias of current failing services","Back in 2019 SBS Australia and the Australian Men‚Äôs Health Forum (AMHF) reported that the proportions of boys contacting the Australian government and charity funded Kids Helpline had plummeted from 35% of callers to 21% of callers since 2008. This massive failure to engage with boys by the key children‚Äôs counselling service was otherwise met with indifference in the mainstream of child mental health service provision and suicide prevention culture. 
https://www.sbs.com.au/news/coronavirus-worries-have-australian-children-calling-kids-helpline-every-69-seconds
https://www.amhf.org.au/kids_helpline_reaching_fewer_boys

Kids Helpline has acknowledged this loss of engagement with boys, but appears to be taking a feminist ideological approach of ‚Äúboy blaming‚Äù when looking for solutions. The Australian Human Rights Commission in conjunction with Kids Helpline, has recently produced a report analysing issues of concern kids have raised in counselling sessions during COVID-¬¨19, which shows kids have experienced serious impacts on their mental health, social connections and education. But the analysis is fundamentally flawed as the respondents were predominantly female (&gt;75%), and only include a very small proportion of non-LGBTI boys.
https://kiddipedia.com.au/children-experiencing-serious-impacts-during-pandemic/

Kids Helpline conducted a survey of kids using the service and parents, including questions on how to encourage more boys to use the service. However, the questions asked show an entrenched culture of misandry and victim blaming, by focusing poor service use on issue related to masculinity, rather than service provision. 

Q2- How can we engage young boys to have open conversations about their feelings?

Q3- Do you think this is part of a larger conversation about breaking down barriers of gender stereo-types to allow boys to understand it‚Äôs ok to be vulnerable &amp; to give them permission to talk about their feelings.?

Q4-Do you think we need to provide more guidance to boys to give them the tools and language to articulate their feelings?

Completely missing from the analysis is any acknowledgement that the service is run by almost entirely by women, both in terms of management and counselling staff, many of who have radical feminist beliefs with histories of public speaking and publications focused almost entirely on the welfare of women and girls. 

This shallow misandrist approach of blaming male stereotypes is entirely sourced from a feminist ideological framing of masculinity (the strawman stereotype), and reveals a service culture at best unsuitable, and at worst, openly hostile to men and boys. The continuing failure of Kids Helpline to engage with boys, and similar problems related to services provided to men and boys by feminist dominated organisations, suggests a high clinical need for discrete services for men and boys, provided by professionals appropriately trained to deliver services without feminist bias and stereotypes, and without male-blaming. 

Unfortunately, it is unlikely that these kinds of effective specialised services will ever be provided given the current gender bias of the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Sex Discrimination Commission, and Kids Helpline. All of these important public services entrusted to provide and oversee the equitable delivery of services to the most vulnerable in our community, are dominated by women with little or no interest in the welfare of men and boys, women entrenched in a culture of feminist stereotypes and misandry.",18,0

incest,"I was on a therapy website where random people can privately listen to struggles. I was texting a lady there about my sexual struggles when she asked to discuss my sexual thoughts. I vaguely described them and kept the conversation towards ""sex is dangerous for me because of STIs, false accusations, honey traps, criminal prostitution, and etc."" But she kept belittling the dangers and she asked again to describe the thoughts.

Usually I'd describe the thoughts, but they were sexual. Sexual communications are a bannable offense. I've been suspended a lot from that website for sexting. I felt very insecure about describing my thoughts and didn't really want to. So instead, I asked if she ever had sexual thoughts and how those thoughts were.

She just vaguely described the thoughts with ""Great thoughts"" or some similar phrase. Since she answered so vaguely, I replied ""I think you are lying."" So she texted ""I had great sex with my stepson last night,"" or some similar phrase. I immediately blocked her.

Any other man might've asked her to go into details or may have fantasized about that, but I didn't. I remembered a lot of posts on r/mensrights about women who sexually abuse boys and men. 

How would a woman feel if she were talking with a man who said ""I had great sex with my step daughter last night?"" That man would probably be reported to the police for child sexual abuse. Men already face stereotypical allegations of pedophilia, to the extent where some orphanages might reject foster applicants simply due to gender. I've been on a babysitting website where nearly 90% of babysitters were women and where my babysitting account was deleted and refunded without explanation.

Some people might assume the step son is an adult who tempted his step mom. But let's be real: the step mom could've complained about the step son's sexual advances to his father or the orphanage. And then why would the step mom be referencing such incest as a great sexual experience? She has the parental authority alone to thwart off her step son's sexual advances, and to even return him to the orphanage under sexual criminal or civil charges. And why would any step son risk losing a parent or supporter for sex?

Her incest can easily involve into an envious fight between the son and the father. Even without the father, the step mom legally has more power than her step son. She can probably kick him out for a night if he stares at another woman. Incest is horrible and that step son is in a lot of crap now. 

On that therapy website, random women tend to block me whenever I describe my sexual thoughts upon request, but today I ended up blocking a woman instead. The reversal is all very interesting. From now on, whenever I'm having a conversation with another women there, I should ask her about her thoughts before disclosing my thoughts. I don't want to be perverted there by women who practice incest.",5,0

Has anyone else found misandry in academics?,"one major advantage I have over 95% of people my age (16m) is my intelligence, most kids my age can‚Äôt define the word quanta (an elementary particle related to one of the four forces of nature electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak forces IE: the electron is the quanta of electromagnetism) ffs most kids my age don‚Äôt even have a basic scientific understanding outside of the little science we‚Äôre taught in school.

Yet I‚Äôve been put down in academics almost my entire life even in science classes of which I already knew most of the shit they taught in those classes years before taking them. It always seemed no matter how much effort I put in my grade would either be the same or worse, almost like someone was just saying ‚Äúnah fuck you your grade is a 67‚Äù.

Before we went virtual for this god awful pandemic I usually got really good grades on tests (80s-90s) except for classes on subjects I wasnt very enriched in and just couldn‚Äôt concentrate in like English (70s-80s) but now that they don‚Äôt have to return the test and show us what we did wrong my test grades have been around the 50-70 range.

Nothing changed the tests aren‚Äôt very hard at all (tbh it‚Äôs even easier now that I can Google shit that I forget) but now that tests aren‚Äôt being sent back to show me what I did wrong my grades even on subjects I‚Äôm very good at and very interested in (which means I actively try to learn more about these subjects outside of school and often ponder about them) like math and science classes are slipping?

Coincidence? Definitely not, like I said the subject material is not hard at all the only real thing holding me back is my poor memory and ADHD (which fucks my concentration beyond belief but only when I‚Äôm totally uninterested otherwise I‚Äôm fine)

A rant about #notallmen,"I want to preface this by saying that while I am not a self identified feminist, I do agree with and support the core values of feminism in principle. What I don't agree with is the whole #notallmen mockery. The sarcastic, eye rolling, straw man style of argument is a complete double standard. ""Women are materialistic"" = sexist hate speech. Meanwhile, ""Men (the same gigantic generalization) actively try to suppress and control women"" = finally someone had the courage to say it. Then the arguments start and the easiest way to dismiss the opposition is the #notallmen defence. The unspoken, assumed, unwritten rule that all women have the right to bad mouth ""men"" as a general term because they only refer to the many bad guys out there in the world. Anyone who gets offended by the generalization has CLEARLY missed the point. They weren't talking about you. In fact, they take it a step further. Not only is your complaint about their generalization pointless, but it is its own kind of attack on them. They already have so many moleters, harrassers, attackers, and such to worry about. Now, they have to worry about you! A typical man who doesn't get the joke and feels offended. It's no wonder that these feminist women have no patience for comments or criticisms about their choice of words or style of speech. They already feel ignored, exploited, and harmed by social norms and men most of all. As a husband who works a full time job in China, washes/hangs the laundry, cooks regularly, does the dishes, vacuums and mops the floor, takes out the garbage, feeds the cats and cleans their litter everyday, blah, blah, blah, on and on, THE POINT IS the #notallmen sarcasm relies on constant  antagonism, insults, and shame.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome? 

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.",244,0

The Deafening Silence of Reasonable Women,"Hi all, 

Back in August, I was having some drinks one evening in the bar patio with a couple of dozen younger friends, and was pulled up by a 20-something friend - who otherwise considers himself a Conservative, despite hailing from a very leftist area - and his female friend, about a t-shirt I had on, depicting nubile women, shall we say, approaching states of undress.  

You guessed it - I got the usual patter about ""Objectifying"", ""Sex objects"" etc.  

I replied, ""Guys - it's Saturday night.  This is a public house (bar).  You have to be 18 and over to be drinking here, so we're all grownups and can handle a little skin, especially as there's no genitalia or nipples depicted.""  My friend launched into a diatribe about women's ""feelings""...you can guess I steered the convo onto other matters pretty quick. 

Now, in summer, I wear such t-shirts precisely because so few people do, because there are so few left available in the shops.  Because our rights to do what we men do are under ceaseless attack.  This is my way of flying the flag, or rather, wearing it.  And I've been doing so a decade, now.  

This was the 2nd, maybe third young woman in that time who has expressed distaste.  One bi girl expressed lust over a particularly attractive girl displayed, and we had a chuckle, TOGETHER - two very different people - about taking it in turns with the girl.  Share and share alike.... :) But I digress. 

The point is this....where is the reasonable, yet outspoken, contingent of women?  It's often said that the heaviest brains are the quietest.  The ones who would give a lucid, cogent insight into the way they view my t shirts.  Or view anything.  

The ones who'd say, ""Look mate, we women don't want to be considered weak or neurotic, but the truth is yes, we ARE physically weaker, more prone to depression/neuroses etc, we don't play Chess, Darts, or drive F1 with even a tenth of the success of men or half of us suffer from body dysmorphia, some of us are feminists who are sore seeing so many naked women, and some of us are outright jealous of these young fitties because we can't have such powerful attraction to men.  And of course you have a small minority of women, a tiny minority even, who don't suffer any of the aforementioned hangups, and think it's a healthy male libido that appreciates womanly curves, drum tight skin and thick, long, lustrous hair"".  

Yeah, a few of you guys are laughing right now - and a fewer still gnashing your teeth in anger - at the thought of a woman (n)ever uttering such deep, and frank truths.   Yet I'm CONVINCED such women exist, millions of them even, but in a collective state of fear, only daring to tell the truth to those lucky enough to be their husbands, sons, brothers and even rarer best male friends.  Their collective silence, I would submit to you, is WORSE than the feminists; the latter at least leave you in no doubt about their stupidity, but what about OUR right to have sense about women coming from all angles including from women?

(on a wider perspective, society's nasty habit of withholding the truths that are painful for everyone in the short term but beneficial to the recipient long term, whilst disguising it as ""Politeness"", is something I find deeply immoral - but sadly that's outside the scope of this sub)   

For a gender that prides itself on its communication skills, women are staggeringly poor at relaying exactly what bothers them.   I suspect that to do so, in this case, would first require them to self-analyze to an extremely uncomfortable degree, the ultimate conclusions exposing them to their hypocrisy - those being that despite their protestations of equality, they were never equal, and never going to be equal.  That lack of honesty, with us men in particular and with themselves in general, imo, is one of womanhood's greatest modern failures - perhaps its greatest.",9,0
What is Positive or Good Masculinity,"Okay before I start off, this question is semi rhetorical. I feel like I kind of know what good and positive masculinity is or at least what it should be. But it just seems like all the media and Feminist publications ever talk about is Toxic Masculinity and they never talk about Good Masculinity. They always insist that not all Masculinity is bad and yet they never tell us exactly what exactly it is in Masculinity that isn't bad. I'm sorry if this is coming off like a rant but I have honestly have just reached my limit on hearing the term ""Toxic Masculinity"" all over social media and even in the news. I really just want to hear good things about masculinity especially from feminists, the same people who say they don't hate men yet often say very hateful things about men. I know some feminists do come in here normally to troll or try to refute things so if there are any Feminists here reading this, here is your opportunity to talk positively about Masculinity and talk about the Good things about Masculinity and not the ""Toxic"" things.",29,0

"Gender pay gap is a claim to bring men down: If women are cheaper to employ, why don't businesses fire all men and hire women..."," Gender pay gap does not make sense: If women are cheaper to employ, why don't businesses fire all men and hire women? 

I can't understand feminist non-sense. Men and women must have equal access to employment, which they do. The fact that there is a pay gap does not mean anything. For example, women might have different priorities in life and less experience compared to men. Also, they choose different professions that pay less and are more likely to work part-time. Assuming that women get paid less than men within the same post/company, even though they have the same qualifications, experience and performance, then it could be said that women do not negotiate their salaries hard enough or prefer to apply to lower paying posts/adverts, because they perceive these positions as less competitive.

If there is a gap we must empower women to take more risks, instead of bringing down men and nurturing victim culture, conflict and hatred.",109,0

The things that made me want to join r/MensRights (Love you guys btw),"\*Warning: this could be upsetting or triggering, contains sexual abuse\*

&amp;#x200B;

I saw a story from a guy who was violently raped when he was young.

That already got me upset. But it gets worse.

When he decided to open up and get therapy, the therapist told him that he didn't believe him, and called child protective services on him because they assumed the man was abusing his wife and children. The guy divorced his wife because he was scared he would hurt them or something bad  would happen.

So basically, a therapist, a person meant to believe in and help people, looked at an emotionally unstable person who has been through serious trauma and reached out for help and thought:

This person is a man, he must be terrible.

Honestly, why???

The other thing that made me want to join was Johnny Depp's and Amber Heard's crazy ""Nobody will believe you because you're a man"" thing.

Then there's the overall radical feminist thing. Honestly the worst.

The last thing is, women are really privileged these days, and can be absolutely toxic.

Women also get compliments and such all the time.

Men's suicide rate and severe self-harm rate is much higher than women's; but they remain bashed by the internet and in general. When was the last time a man got a hug or a compliment without being attacked or called gay? Honestly, I feel really badly about the popularity of ""Women good, men bad"" stuff, and I want to say that I love my guys for being so strong despite all the hate they get and the bias against them.

"""Never get committed (marriage) &amp; Never provide to her ‚Äù Not MGTOW","Feminist have pushed Women not perform the feminine role and denounce responsibility to their actions. It's high time men denounce their roles too

In my point of view traditional masculine and feminine role served a purpose. To keep checks and balances for both men and women in the society.

Men provide and protect the house. Women provide kids and make the house into a liveable home. Both promised monogamy and care for each other in marriage.

Now this is being dismantled step by step &amp; promotes favouring only to women.

I am not suggesting mgtow, but some what similar. Sleep around don't commit to relationship, until your extremely sure. Consider this as your marriage. Don't buy her anything concrete(gifts, cars, house or money). If you spend on her make sure you are a part of it like a dinner, vacation trip. Don't sponsor spa &amp; make overs, that's her responsibility to keep her attractive to you. If she pushes for marriage, start searching for your new mate and break up when you find one. You will always find a better one. 

If you are like me and want a kid, hire a surrogate mother (cheaper than a car) to have your own kid or adopt.

strange request,"The other day, I was at the store when a young woman asked me to take her card out of the ATM. Allegedly her nails were preventing her to take the card out.

Now I'm a nice guy. Whenever any woman asks me to reach for something that's high on a shelf in a food store, I reach for it.

But I had to get a card, not food. And I had to get it from an ATM machine, not a shelf. So I said that I couldn't help with her card because I didn't want to infect her with COVID-19.

She wasn't disabled. She wasn't old. She was within reach of the card. She just had to use her fingers in a certain way to get it. Did she want to piggyback on me, to avoid touching the dirty floor too?

Any other man might've tried to be chivalrous and aid her, but I've been wary around young woman. I don't find much criminal reports about them, and a lot of the known reports seem to portray them as innocent. But I know women, like humans and animals, have the capacity to prey on others. A society that fails to report or publish such predation doesn't affect that predation's exist. If nobody told me about gravity, then that doesn't mean that I won't fall off a cliff.

marrying,"One way to stave off sexual predators is by having a wife.

But what if she has extramarital sex? Imagine living with a woman who contracts herpes or other new or random STIs from other men that can be passed onto me, even without my having sex with her. Living with her would shorten my lifespan rather than extend it, which the latter was the goal in avoiding sexual predators.

Why did she marry me if she's going to have extramarital sex? How can I make sure that I don't marry a sexual predator, especially when I barely have any connections with childhood female friends?

What if she wrongfully initiates divorce, using it as a tool to take resources from me? I've read of men who have been divorce-raped. Maybe I can read laws protecting me from such wrongful divorce but she can always fabricate evidence, documents, and witness. And I could lose children! My mom and dad divorced, and my mom took all three children. I can't imagine losing a child, even to a predator. Remarrying after divorce is believed to be near adultery, so I might not ever rightfully recover.

I could initiate a divorce in many situations, but I feel such divorce is shameful under Christianity. And again, remarrying is like near adultery. Outside of Christianity, my resources would likely be taken away too.

If I do decide to marry, for the sake of staving off sexual predators, then I'd need to be careful with whom I marry. I probably shouldn't rush marriage. I can probably find local marriage and divorce statistics to review the longevity of some marriages in my society.",3,0

Sister calls me a misogynist,"So basically, I had a normal talk with my sister about feminism and men. I disagreed that people can't say KAM and RAW. To sum up she said that it is misogynistic to not agree with KAW and RAW just because of the person's trauma. This is very hypocritical because she said that a women doesn't need trauma to say KAM and the opposite for a man. She got very emotional and very mad. She also compared me to my dad who is a real cultural misogynistic. I don't understand how people can just normalize hating on an entire gender. Wtfs wrong with her. There was much more we talked about like Men don't get killed because they are men. I said that it is not prevelant but it still happens. She said that it is not a problem. I asked her if she could go into depth of what she said and she straight up said that mens lives don't matter. I agree that men and women should be 50/50 with equal laws and no bias. I don't see how I made her batshit crazy by just stating my very normal opinion. She also said that women are much better than men just because she couldn't vote a 100 years ago. that's like saying black people are better than men just cuz they have a very bas history with white people. I support BLM but I don't agree that anyone is superior or inferior just because of their race, creed, ethnicity, skin colour, etc.",28,0

prostitution watch,"Prostitution is illegal here, but some local prostitutes still try to trick men into buying diseases and being robbed. Some local prostitutes get really desperate for resources too, and would stalk and prey on any man; just as a hungry animal would eat any prey when starving. Some prostitutes can even make use of a man's life, in the event that he has no resources to steal.

Before leaving home, I forgot to carry my defense against female predators and prostitutes. But since I was already out the door, I didn't bother to turn back to carry the defense. What's the worst that could happen?

While observing nature, I crossed by some woman who seemed pretty normal. But then I remembered that I was walking in an area far from the buildings, cars, and roads. It was in the area that I came across two people who appeared to be having sex and tried to communicate with me, so I became alert.

After a while, I looked back and she had turned around as if she were stalking me.

She was wearing bright colors, maybe to visually attract prey. She was wearing tight jeans that had rips showing black pants or leggings underneath. Why would anyone wear such revealing pants during the cold winter?

Maybe she was an ordinary woman. But when she passed by me again, quite soon after our first encounter, she didn't appear to have shoes. She was stepping on the mud with black socks, even stepping in a puddle. It was not a usual sight. Maybe she wasn't sober.

Maybe she needed help, but she should've asked me for help. She's an adult and has the capacity to seek help. I'm not falling for that ""women are innocent"" or ""women are easily frightened by men"" crap. Women are adults and need to act as such. And I'm not letting my guard down simply because of gender. A female bear can eat a man just as gruesomely as a male bear can.

I would not be surprised if she was a prostitute. Through the way she was dressed, her distance away from witnesses, and her proximity near me; her being a prostitute/predator was pretty obvious. There were also two men further up the park trail that she was walking up. I don't commonly see two men working out together at that area.

I'm happy that I kept my distance from her, though I really didn't like her proximity near me. It was an ugly and unpleasant sight. I really should've carried my defense, to keep her away. Well, I learned my lesson.",2,0

"I really hate it when someone says ""teach men not to *insert violent crime*"", ""toxic masculinity*, and any other buzzy words.","This post is a rant.

I don't mind if I'm a gay man, I'm just also one of the brothers that I'm fighting for!

It's really annoying when someone could pull out t34¬©H m3N n0T T0 *insert violent crime, ex: rape, pervert, etc.

The context in there is misandristic and it's flawed.
The phrase is often generally implied. The only subject in the context is ""men"".

Teach men not to *insert violent crime. Why though? Do men do that unless they are taught? Even that phrase makes seem the violent crime normalised at the first place.

The criminal be like ""jeez, am I doing bad even though I'm matured enough to understand and know what I'm doing? I have to stop though, thanks for reminding""

Blames the crime is only to men and erases female sexual abusers too.

-------

The mainstream's view regarding masculinity is extremely misleaded. As they see masculinity is only bad stuff like crime and boys can't cry.

And annoyingly, when some guy just did wrong by their personal situation, and that guy happened to be a man, people will blame, toxic masculinity, that it just generalizes men's nature that they do those stuff. I think it's a False Equivalence fallacy, comparing a male criminal, to a male who's just eating ramen at the afternoon with his son, and happened to be both men, assumed that they have the same nature.

The term ""toxic masculinity"" was only originated by the mythopoetic men's movement(1980s and 1990s), which is advocating for self-help and therapy for men. The term became widespread in 2010 when the popular writings, media, and the mainstream has been using the term to refer masculine norms.

You can't remove violence, rigorous ambition, and competence into the male psyche, and that doesn't mean it's bad. It's males' biological instincts, and forcing something to remove at its natural state doesn't do good, it will just cause inappropriation, annoyance, irritate, and ignorance.

The violence can be used to good to fight tyranny like the army, instead of unnecessarily hurt people.

The rigourous ambition that make guys do risky stuff can be harnessed to do heroic actions.

The competence and greed of males can be useful for building economies and sports, rather than cheating.

You can't make good men by making them less men.
You can't make good men, by taking the ""men"" away.
They become good if they stop doing the bad.

Masculinity is not toxic, it's just by how you use it.

Plus, the way people say 1t$ 4l$0 d0N3 B¬• m3N to for example, male to male crime, and especially when men are the majority that make the laws and so they therefore imply that it's not an issue even though there is unjust happening in males is just victim blaming.

What is the biggest problem facing father's today?,"I'm going to argue that it is the division of labour in the home, it is the fact that so many of us fathers feel not just the need to provide for our families, but the obligation that it is solely our duty to make sure the rent/mortgage is paid, that food is on the table and that our kids have access to the resources they need to make it into adulthood as a well balanced, healthy and productive adult themselves.

That should not be the case, the third wave of feminism we are in right now has rightfully championed for women's equality in the workplace, however that same movement actively works against mens equality in the home, while the traditional gender roles at work have been crashing down for 50 year's, the same has not happened for the traditional gender roles at home, both for legislation and societies expectations, and there is a good reason for this.

It is cheaper for our government.

Our government knows that men have been conditioned for hundreds or thousands of years to be the sole income earner in the home, and we do that because we want the best for our families, and that fact it used against us, one of the primary metrics used by the court for who get's primary custody is ""who has been the primary caregiver before separation"" and of course because we want to work and provide for our families, that is the mother.

because we want to provide for our families, our spouses don't have to work, they don't have to grow a career and they end up doing the work at home with our children.

And that's where they have us, during separation our lawmakers know that we can make money, because we have been for years, and they know that it takes money to raise children, so they can get us twice, first they make sure that the mother of our children get primary care of the kids, they know that they have been at home not growing a career for year's, and so cant earn as much, so we pay child support, they know that we will have to work more, and so we will pay more tax, while also subsidising our kids mother through child support, they know that if we get primary care or even 50/50 they will not get as much tax revenue, and will have to support both parents even if its what's best for the children.

So how do we combat this? simply put WE can't, those of us that are already in this situation are going to be stuck in it, as long as the cycle continues like this it's going to stay the same.

But what we can do is try our best to teach our sons, and the young adults in out lives to be careful who they have children with, I think that it's great the women have been given greater access to the workplace, but in order for us to have greater access to our children we have to hold our partners to that, we have to be selective about who we have children with and make sure they are contributing to our families finances well before children are involved, and more importantly we have to make sure that WE are involved in our households and the raising of our children.

If we want change so that we are involved with our children after separation, we must make sure we are involved with our children before as well.",7,0

The second article is about a prostitute who uses a male accomplice, I believe. As always, the man gets arrested and the woman (true culprit) is acquitted or ignored.

If you look for news articles or information concerning prostitutes online, you are going to get a lot of sex worker advocacy or prostitution victimization (or highlighting prostitutes who get hurt by men rather than men who get hurt by prostitutes' STIs or prostitutes' crime schemes.) It's sad to live in a society that defends pathological and criminal predators but punishes their infected or robbed victims. Some people, like my own brother, even victim-blame male victims by saying they are dumb for hiring the prostitutes in the first place. Oh boy, I'm happy that prostitution is illegal where I live: some man has common sense here.

But some articles are encouraging me to do some prostitute-busting on my own. It'd be nice to keep those predators from giving hiv and other diseases to local working men. In the beginning, I might start by busting stray prostitutes before those who use male accomplices.

On the dangers of hooking up with women.,"I stumble on this post https://np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/kxs5gp/quarantine_revealed_something_nasty_about_dating/

Apparently, many women are afraid of unfamiliar men. And they have every right to be - though I don't know if murderers really use dating apps to find victims. And if they do, what are the chances to end up with one?

Anyway, that got me thinking about the occasions when women have tricked me or my friends. 

When I was in my early 20s I travelled a lot in Europe, sometimes alone sometimes with friends. Once I in a railway station in Hamburg waiting for the train, my friend left with a young woman. I didn't know what was going on but later on I found out that she had led him to a room where he got robbed. When he started asking about his wallet, a couple of men entered the room. Luckily, my friend manged to escape. This was early on on our Interrail, but he had to return home having lost most of his money. 

Once in Ibiza I went to a bar - or perhaps it was a nigh club - with a friend. A couple of ladies came to sit with us and asked if we could buy them drinks. You have to remember that we were about 20-year-old guys from Finland. Anyway, I warned my friend against it but he was a rich guy, a drunk rich guy, and ordered drinks anyway. When we got the bill the sum was something so insane that even my friend started to get second thoughts. So, we left for the toilet and managed to get out - though there was some sort of strange curtain labyrinth between the toilet and front door -  and then jumped into a car we had rented and drove away as fast as we could. The only time I have driven while heavily under the influence. 

The first time this pattern emerged on my travels was in Athens where I was without company. Nothing terrible happened but the experience was a bit  scary - and educational. A girl about my age started talking with me in the street. She seemed very nice and seemed to be interested in me. After a while she asked if I wanted to go to a caf√© with her. She led me to this murky place without customers and left immediately after I had sat down. Three older, shady-looking men sat down with me and just stared at me talking to each other in a language I didn't recognize. Without thinking I got up, my heart pounding, mumbled something about leaving, and left. Whatever the plan had been they let me go. (Later on I have learned that you should not act like a victim in a situation like that but show self-assurance. Perhaps I did that without thinking about it by not staying but leaving immediately.) 

Anyway, it's a pattern, attractive women targeting young and drunk men and leading them to potentially dangerous situations. As you all probably know already - though I really didn't when I was young. 

Boys and young men should also be at least a bit afraid of women. Also on dating apps.",168,0

I wanted to update the community on where we're at and what's going on with the survey.

"Crazy idea, but should ""making oneself dependent"" also be considered domestic abuse?","So I know a lot of people think domestic violence law in the UK is kinda crazy. ""Controlling"" is extremely vague - if I'm being attacked by a wild dog then I'm trying to control it if I pry its jaws open ... I think it essentially relies on an implicit ""reasonableness"" criteria and I've never heard of a couple have a mess break-up where they considered the other to be reasonable. 

Anyhow ...

Scottish legislation includes ""making B dependent on, or subordinate to, A"". For example, forcing a woman to stop work so she relies on the man for income.

However, surely the inverse is also controlling. If I break my legs or quit my job or make myself dependent in some other way, this would put my SO in a very precarious position - I've put them in a situation when they can't leave without causing a lot of harm. This would be especially difficult if alimony was at play.

"Despite this crowfunding website don't let me to put the ""MEN'S RIGHTS"" tag in a campaign, I still decided to start it for my university project. All earnings will be donated to an Italian domestic violence hotline that helps victims regardless of their gender, and in particular male victims.","[The campaign](https://www.bonfire.com/la-violenza-non-ha-genere/) is in Italian, so I'm sorry if you don't understand it. The title can be translated into ""Violence has no gender"" or ""Violence is not a gender issue"". I had the opportunity to start my activism after my [last video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64Gll25rsmU), where I called some domestic violence hotlines to see if they offer help to men.

As you can see, the campaign is under the ""Women's rights"" section of the website, because **I was unable to put the ""Men's rights"" tag when I started it**: the website litterally refused to add this specific tag when I tried to create a new one. In fact, I was able to add some new tags, but not ""Mens' rights"". LOL

I hope the campaign will do so well that people behind this website understands that there is not shame to support men's rights, because everyone deserves to be heard and helped. **Men are humans**.

This will be the final work for the marketing exam of my university group. I've already told it to my professor, so don't worry for us: there will not be a ""feminist backlash"".

Why the stereotypical view of men is so negative,"This is inspired by from Roy Baumeister's *Is there anything good about men?*

Men,  compared to women, are at the extremes of almost any Bell curve that measures human traits (if there is natural variance and the averages of the sexes are close to each other - like they often are). So, there are, for example, more geniuses and retards among men than among women. 

Furthermore, we humans have this tendency to notice and remember things that are out of the ordinary, the dog bites man kind of stories. And because men are at the extremes we tend to find these extraordinary stories about men much more often than about women. It's much more likely that the richest people are men rather than women. Or violent thugs.

And because we the confirmation bias - we look and see evidence that supports our prejudices - we can easily become convinced that men are successful and evil while women aren't.

But why is successful negative? There are a lot of people who think that success is somehow dubious to begin with. Furthermore, Feminism has managed to tell people that the success men enjoy has not been achieved fairly.

So we see and remember men who are morally disgusting.",4,0

"One more reason why wage gap is a ""statistical error"" (from Roy Baumeister's Is there anything good about men?)","The book is really good (though he sometimes doesn't know all the relevant facts but who would). His point: 

&gt; There is a legal minimum wage. Of course, even if the legal minimum wage were not a factor, there would still be the de facto minimum of zero. Nobody works for a negative salary. A negative salary would mean, essentially, that if you were really incompetent you would pay the company to let you work for them.
&gt; 
&gt; Again assume that the average inputs are exactly the same for men and women: the same qualifications, the same abilities, the same efforts and sacrifices. Assume the average man and woman produce exactly the same quality and quantity of work. And assume that there are more men at both extremes.
&gt; 
&gt; There may be a minimum salary, but there is no maximum. And so at the high extreme, the top-achieving men can pull up the men‚Äôs average salary. Meanwhile, at the low end, the floor (the minimum wage and the zero point) prevents the low-achieving men from pulling the male average back down. As a result, men‚Äôs average salary will end up higher than women‚Äôs‚Äîeven if the average man is precisely equal to the average woman on every single factor that determines salary.

Futhermore he argues that the same mechanism affects grades:

&gt; In many college classes, the majority of students get A grades. Failure is increasingly rare.
&gt; 
&gt; The highest possible grade in most colleges, or what statisticians call the ceiling, is an A. The lowest (the floor) is an F. Over the last couple of decades, all grades have drifted upward toward the ceiling. The floor is far from the average, and the ceiling is close to it.
&gt; 
&gt; The low ceiling will affect the average grades of men and women.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember, we have more men at both extremes of actual achievement.
&gt; 
&gt; The really high achieving men, however, can no longer pull up the male average, because of the low ceiling. There is no grade above an A. (Curiously, many universities do not even permit A plus grades.) Lots of people get A‚Äôs. And so the super-brilliant students get the same grade (A) as the moderately bright and conscientious ones.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, though, the low-achieving males will pull the male average down. There are more men than women getting the really low grades, and as these stand out more and more because of grade inflation, they will exert a strong downward pull on the men‚Äôs average.
&gt; 
&gt; The result? Women will get better grades than men, on average.",5,0
My school experience,"This happened to me in school.

The teacher was an absolute PoS. Generally she was incompetent and disliked, but here is one particular incident involving her.

In our school, it was the practice to stand up and wish the teacher when she entered. Most teachers would wish back- Good morning, children- or something like that. This particular teacher would say ""Good morning, girls"". Reason being that ""Boys behave badly"". She would also ignore any doubts/questions asked by boys, scold boys and let off girls for the same mistakes and had an obvious bias while marking papers.

So one day, we(boys) decided to *not* wish the teacher- why should we, when she disregards us completely? So we did that.

She, predictably, got furious, as we 'disrespected' her. The matter went to the principal and she(principal) initially was very angry but became softer after she heard our point of view. The teacher was reprimanded and we were let off with a ceremonial warning.

To those who subscribe to feminism: you can't expect me not to shiver after a life in the cold. I'm done acquiescing to being treated like something you're entitled to control.,"

[https://preventdomesticviolence.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/R40\_Shift\_2020\_Supporting\_Best\_Practices\_Principles.pdf](https://preventdomesticviolence.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/R40_Shift_2020_Supporting_Best_Practices_Principles.pdf)

I stumbled upon the above document tonight, and didn't expect to have been so effected by it. As a victim of child sexual abuse, reading through the above sentiments really fucking hurt me. I don't have anything, no one really to depend on for emotional clarity but myself; which is more or less the point I suppose, I spent so many years denying the pain of a secret I was waiting for permission to let myself in on. Reading through these guidelines made me feel as though I were back before I no longer had the choice of denial, before I was able to free myself from the burden of absolute responsibility for everything I experience, before I realized that existing as I am and feeling how I feel doesn't make me a monster like him; I spent my entire adolescence painting new masks for every occasion, every clique, every moment. Everything was fine so long as I managed to be anything but Myself. But charades is a party game, and suffice it to say, the party ended when loneliness and isolation set upon my every moment. All that time spent acting, like characters in a vapid sitcom. It's no wonder I remember so very little before my 18th birthday, there simply never was anything real to remember; how could I have been so content to live as little more than a means by which to satisfy the situational approval of others? I let myself down, and lost 10 years of my life as a consequence, not to mention all those ""friends"" I spent so much time pleasing and trying to impress. Frankly, I don't want to do that to myself any longer, regardless of whatever people may think of me, I need to vindicate myself against this strange fucking contempt I've shown for myself. So honestly fuck it, why should I second guess my desire to standup on behalf of my own experiences and feelings?

These are emotional claims, though I could certainly condemn them empirically also, however, in this instance, I feel uniquely justified in just being fucking angry about these ""best practices"".

How the fuck do these people find it remotely appropriate, or necessary to teach boys why doing harm to other is wrong? As if I couldn't possibly understand what it feels like to be violated, to be voided of trust and security, to be hurt and to keep being hurt and feel it's okay because no one ever told you it wasn't? As if the only way for my own experiences to matter is dependent on it's relevance to the well-being of others? How fucking dare these people presume the authority to insist upon what my obligations should be, and how exactly it is I ought to behave.

Anyone who is capable of selectively defining a boy's trauma in their own adulterated words for purposes which benefit ANYONE but the boy whose trauma they are addressing, without even bothering to pretend as though they have his interest at heart (god forbid, as a fucking priority), is clearly a deeply immoral person. Why should I matter any less than anyone else? What the fuck gives them the sense that's it's okay to assert MY complicity in the perpetuation of the very violence to which I was victim? Fuck these people. Honestly, I'm done being nice about this, if they want to make me the enemy of their perfidious cult, fine, whatever the fuck it takes to prevent them from doing further harm to innocent boys on the basis of THEIR OWN PROJECTIONS. I am not responsible for the falsehoods, biases, and down right hateful opinions of others. This has to stop. Insisting that boy's are somehow complicit in a system WHICH DOES NOT EVEN EXIST by using satire-worthy double-speak terms like, ""compassionate accountability"", is simply an unacceptable way to treat children.

I felt disgusting, ashamed, and monstrous even without the help of feminist indoctrination, had I been taught to accept those feelings perpetuated largely by MY trauma as realities intrinsic to my identity as a boy? The self-hatred I suffer was once so intense that I fell into a habit of scaring myself with searing metal-tweezers; had I been made to internalize the voice of this document, I'm confident the extent of my self-harm would have fair surpassed merely a wrist covered in burn scars.

Statements like this one:

&gt;Is the program focused on building empathy while not devaluing women or reinforcing the idea that men need to protect women? Does it acknowledge and respect the harms men themselves may have experienced without losing focus on the harms they may have perpetuated?

And

&gt;Does the program create a safe place for men and boys to understand their roles and responsibilities in ending violence? Are safe spaces created for diverse men and boys to learn, reflect, and change?

Seriously? How fucking stupid do they think males are to accept this shit? These feminist ideologues go OUT OF THEIR WAY to clarify that the ONLY reason they're aren't stating, in plain terms, that which they believe is not out of a concern for boys\` well-being. Of course not. Rather, the use of meaningless jargon is employed so as to ""facilitate this process in compassionate ways in order to prevent disengagement, resentment, and backlash"", as opposed to the myriad potential harms this psychopathic conspiracy theory is likely to cause a boy in terms of shame, self-hatred, alienation, and absolute demoralization.

Just a final message to anyone capable of looking through the document and not finding it shockingly appalling, and indeed akin to a form of compulsory psychological child-abuse: no, I DO NOT acknowledge my male privilege; no, I AM NOT complicit in an imaginary system you believe to have been created by boys and men for the purpose of abusing women and girls; no, I DO NOT need your approval as a victim of sexual abuse; no, YOU DO NOT get to claim responsibility for my own sense of morality; no, I DO NOT owe restitution to anyone for existing as I have always done: innocently.

If I were capable of submitting to this nonsense, and somehow retained some iota of rationality, I wouldn't waste time in discussions of my ""male privilege"" (whatever the fuck that even means). Nor would I waste my time digging deeper into my cognitive dissonance regarding the illusion that feminism in its current form actually cares about my well-being, I'd simply accept the claim being offered: even in treating a traumatized boy, the goal is not to help him, merely it is to mitigate the threat he poses to women and girls; males are obstacles at best, and threats at worst, and the traumatized one's pose an even greater threat, thus as the well-being of boys and men was never a concern, the absolute most feminist action a male can take is suicide. Right? We're not going to talk about realities. Like the fact that 80% of suicide victims are male, or that 1/6 isn't a particularly dissimilar proportion to 1/4, or any other issue which shows males as a population in clear need of help. We only discuss male mental health after the latest school shooting, that is: another incident of a mass-murder suicide. What the fuck am I to make of that except to say that we clearly don't mind suicides in which the sole victim is also the perpetrator, in fact, we might prefer it when men and boys take their lives, provided he does it out of sight, so as to avoid subjecting potential witnesses to the burden of his last failure.

While it's true the awareness to the fact that, contrary to popular belief, men and boys do feel pain and they do suffer, has risen through the years, I cannot help but feel I'd prefer silence to an awareness which castigates me as an accessory to be used. I'd much prefer to be treated as invisible than to be treated as dangerous. To be treated as damaged and THEREFORE dangerous is beyond what I can handle. Time and time again, the world makes itself clear to me: it doesn't care about ME, and when it appears to, I'll never need to look very hard before I find the catch. I feel demoralized, maligned, and willfully misunderstood; if I could pretend not to feel I would, but I can't do that when someone else's words reveal the truth that indeed I do feel, but does so only in order to redefine those feelings in service of it's own goal.",23,0

Not too long ago, I was reading comments on YouTube about circumcision, and I found a comment suggesting having boys castrated after birth.

Here's what the person said in their comment:

**""I think castration on boys shortly after birth should be legal and should be a option made by the parents like how circumcision is. Think about it, a lot of women's lives would be better and safer if most men were castrated, since less¬†women would get raped or murdered and they wouldn't get harassed and stalked by men, and they wouldn't be sexualized in the media and in fiction all the time. Also men tend to be violent because of their testosterone level, so there would be less violence in the world if most men were castrated.¬†And also, if most men were castrated, they also would do better in schools and behave more better. So I¬†think societies would be a way better place if most men were castrated.**

**And also, the idea I have in order for women to still get pregnant is that have the men who are not castrated paid large amounts of money to donate sperm at sperm banks. Or we can start creating artificial sperm or find another way to get women pregnant without the need of sperm.""**

I think the person's comment got deleted since I can't find it. But recently I stumbled upon another comment that is similar, but the main thing that was different with the comment was that instead of castration, the person was suggesting that the whole glans of a boy's penis should be amputated shorty after birth. And like with the castration comment, the comment actually received a couple of likes, and some people commented back, saying that they agree with it.

As I said, it seems like our society now thinks that nearly all men are bad, when it's actually only very few men out of the whole male population. It now seems like our society is now a misandrist society.

Even if these are just jokes, they are a very fucked up thing to say. Circumcision is already bad enough, we don't need worse stuff like castration and amputating the glans of the penis to start happening.

Politically, in the US especially, the idea of men's rights appears to be one sided. With one side ""advocating"" for it and being called misogynistic if they do and the other embracing the ideology of feminism and toning down masculinity to atone for perceived past transgressions, it seems you can't share the MRA belief across lines. 

I'd like to believe this crosses all walks of life, regardless of race, politics, religion (excluding overtly gender biased believers) or other uniquely defining characteristic. Fighting for your children, your physical and mental welfare and ensuring you have an open and non-judgemental support system along with an equal voice to women in all aspects should be a right for all men. 

Unfortunately, it would seem if you're on the left, you're beholden to the ""smash the patriarchy"" beliefs. Since Men's Rights are about mental well being, equality in outcome given an even playing field and addressing glaring issues with the declining performance and health of boys and men, I'd hope this is more than an echo chamber for one side. Without both sides actively taking a stance, I perceive the MRA will always be shouted down by the feminists and their followers which exist solely on one side.",25,0

edit: so seems it hasn't done anything exclusively for women (except for the war-time thing) but that's fine, because at least it doesn't pretend to do stuff for women.",28,0

Sexual trauma and men,"I'm a victim advocate and I'm in a training on male survivors and sexual trauma and my heart just breaks. I'm hearing stories after stories of men abused as children and how men don't disclose the abuse till wait later in their adult life. 1 in 6 men have been abused and assaulted and it's believed that the number is higher and its just not documented. I feel that society tells men ""to man up"", ""don't be weak"", ""deal with it"" and it's not fair. Survivors of sexual abuse have increased challenges with relationships and substance abuse and I feel there's not enough safe space for men to discuss such issues. As a society, we need to encourage men to speak up and to help them heal. I suggest you take a moment and watch [survivors stories ](https://youtu.be/2p06x-yumc0)

Computers use languages as instructions. Any meaningful sequence of signals is a language. 

Languages can act on languages to change themselves. 

Replace ""male privilege"" with ""male achievement"". This is an interesting experiment in language.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see from this video, the majority of kids know that the gender wage gap is **FAKE AND BS**. It's only the kids that have been raised by feminist parents or been taught fake feminist beliefs in school that believe this nonsense.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a fact that women shop more and do a lot of other things while men are physically stronger and are better at sticking to a single task than women, and A LOT OF KIDS ACKNOWLEDGE THIS. It's not until feminists start saying ""Gender is a 'social construct' and women and men are completely equal"" that these kid's minds are screwed up.

&amp;#x200B;

Many feminists will argue that it is these kids that are not ""educated"" enough, yet there is clear proof here by even some kids who **see the real world and see the work place** that it is common sense that the gender wage gap is **COMPLETELY BS.**

Because you are not entitled to demanding people take care of kids that are not theirs.

&gt;HE LED ME ON WITH FALSE HOPE

&gt;But after another two months he told me it was over ‚Äì he couldn‚Äôt accept my daughter. He led me on with false hope and absolutely broke my heart. I was just blind to the fact he wouldn‚Äôt be a stepdad.

Why the resistance to make responsibility gender-equal?,"Let's be painfully honest: today a female points your finger at you publicly, then cries/screams/accuses at you, depending on the intensity of the action you are doomed: jailed, beaten, or at least restrained to be arrested. That's a huge lot of power from a class that's supposedly oppressed.

It's extremely worrying that people influenced by feminism appear to do anything possible to prevent that privilege from changing, and it's hard to tell if it's plainly because of too much ideology or simply certain people to remain in certain power...

For example, I think it's very profitable to run organizations where people are paid to ‚Äúaddress misogyny‚Äù. What's the incentive to combat something whose very existence means I get paid a huge salary? (people in these organizations usually have higher-class-life enabling salaries)

why all men are sexual.,"(This is a conversation I just had on some online chat support website. Since some women seem to always complain about men being sexual, I decided to text some woman to try to help understand the issue.)

Female: Hey there. Welcome. What brings you here?

Me: I am a male fighting intimate thoughts. I need to remember that bare intimacy in a bedroom is dangerous for me.

Female: Could you give me a reason why you think this is a problem?

Me: Wait, you don't know sex is dangerous?

Female: Too much of anything addicting counts as an addiction and we all know addictions don't end well. But what gives you the impression sex is dangerous for you? Has anything led to this?

Me: I've received a lot of sex education. So you'd have sex with anyone?

Female: Personally, I wouldn't. But we are all human and we are made to be intimate. It's how nature makes us reproduce. I'm assuming given that question, you would? Correct me if I'm wrong.

Me: No I wouldn't. And you wouldn't too. Because it's dangerous. It's like saying ""I don't jump into fire, but you can do it."" Do you think I'm that stupid?

Female: It can be yes. But it's not life threatening. There's certain limits to be taken. Sex can lead to consequences that are dangerous. The act itself isn't much so. 

Me: oh ok, well thanks for taking 9 minutes to finally accept that sex is dangerous, which was a fact I had already started the convo with. I literally started the convo with that fact, and we had to waste 9 minutes to reconfirm it.

Female: So you're saying sex is dangerous and you want to avoid intimate thoughts. I'm not saying I disagree with your statement but I don't agree to all of it. Sex isn't a bad thing, if you don't control yourself and there's a mutual understanding between everyone involved, it's ok.

Me: So if I have sex with someone under mutual agreement, and then get hiv, its ok.

GF Pregnant,"Topic: GF Pregnant due in July. No plans to get married or live together. State Florida 

Goal: Establish paternity, establish fathers right, come to a paternity agreement i.e. how many nights each parent gets. Calculated CS and get and in the system and start paying. 

I've gone thru one divorce so I have an idea how the legal system kind of works in Florida but this one is a little different. GF is pregnant right now and the goal right now is to have a healthy child. We talked about how things would work and typical women can never get a straight answer. 

 I'm wondering at one point I need to seek legal advise. I think a one hour paid consultation now would probably answer some questions now, but its probably way to early to pay a retainer. 

Based on my research, when the child is born. I can be listed as the father on the birth certificate, that doesn't really mean anything. I may be asked to sign a voluntary paternity  acknowledgement, that's a big NO. Ideally we would work together on a paternity agreement that includes a paternity test to just be 100%. My guess she will balk at it. 

So what's next? hire a lawyer and serve her with papers? At the time of the birth she will on Medicaid, she has a job and income, but she was able to sign up durn the covid shut down no questions asked. My research says if your on assistance which includes Medicaid she has to help the State locate the father an establish paternity. So I may get a free test there. But they don't get involved in timesharing or other parent issues. 

So what do you think fellas? not looking to avoid anything. Just wanted to be ahead of the ball and pay my fair share and be part of the Childs life. Am I overthinking this or will the pieces fall in place. What are some pitfalls to watch out for?",14,0

Munsnet (UK) - avoid like the plague!! Biased Moderators.,"A few months ago, my wife initiated a divorce. Obviously this was an upsetting time for me, so in order to get a woman's perspective.

* I was told in no uncertain times:
* I would lose all of my assets
* I wouldn't see my child at all.
* If the wife couldn't afford the remaining mortgage, I would be 'locked in' for the next 14+ years to paying the mortgage and having that debt hanging over me to prevent me buying/renting again.

**As it turns out that advice was bollocks.**

In reality:

* I gave 60% of the equity of the House in cash (more, based on her being the primary caregiver).
* I retained the marital home.
* I gained 3/7 nights and a good proportion of the holidays giving me 3+ nights per year (important for childcare as well as child maintenance costs).
* My pension, as it was largely pre-marital, I gave her 20% of the pot.

So, I went back, politely to leave a comment on the site. The idea was to leave a post, so future men can see what the reality is like, in accordance to Section 25 of the Matrimonial Act.

As you can imagine, I was immediately beset by screaming banshee's on the site. Some posters were reasonable, other's indulged in 'fantasy roleplay' claiming:

* I must have a small dick.
* I would forever be alone.
* Other inane baiting.

The moderators, acting in accordance to the leanings of the site deleted the thread, hoping to gaslight  men in similiar situations.

In real-life (not just mumsnet poster''s fantasies) I know of men who 'give up' and pay child maintenance, rent and mortgage and basically work as indenturered servants.

The moderators not only deleted the thread, but they also deleted and banned the account.

There are radical feminists who think that the world would be a better place if all men were gone or at least if the male population was reduced to ten percent. What's your opinion on that?,"How would the world be a better place if all men were gone? 

A lot of women tend to think that all men are bad just because of the crime statuses. U.S Department of Justice homicide statistics 1980-2008  Of all homicide victims, 76.8% were men and 23.2% were women. 67.8% of those homicides it was male on male crime. 21% was male on female crime. The rest of 11.2% is female on female crime and female on male crime. 

Just because most violent criminals are men, it doesn't mean most men are like that.

Here's a quote from radical feminist **Sally Miller Gearhart**: **""\`Why have any men at all?' wrote Sally Miller Gearhart in a 1982 manifesto titled \`The Future‚ÄìIf There Is One‚ÄìIs Female.'¬† Gearhart is an advocate of ovular merging, a process that involves the mating of two eggs, which has been successfully accomplished with mice.¬† Only female offspring are produced.¬† I've always worried that one day women would figure out how to get along without us and they would be able to reproduce unilaterally, like sponges.¬† It's not genocide, exactly. It's more like job attrition, the way employers cut back positions without actually firing anyone.¬† \`A 75 per cent female to 25 percent male ratio could be achieved in one generation if one half of a population reproduced heterosexually and one half by ovular merging.' according to Gearhart.¬† \`Such a prospect is attractive to women who feel that if they bear sons, no amount of love and care and non-sexist training will save those sons from culture where male violence is institutionalized.'""**

Sally Miller Gearhart has a theory that the only way to save the world is to reduce the number of men to ten percent of the total population.

I think I just solved a bit of the problem with abortion,"This popped in my head and I just put it into writing as quick as possible but still.

If the father doesn't want to take care of the child he can sign something before the birth that means he is not the father (it would basically mean that he wouldn't be the father in the eyes of the court and wouldn't be responsible for the child. If he wants to he can still be involved with the child but in the eyes of the government he wouldn't be a parent, meaning that if the mother wants the child she can take it and the father cant do anything about it). If the father wanted to be the father than he would still have to sign something that would mean he is the father of the child and in that case everything would remain the same as it is now. If the father knowingly abandons the mother of the child before birth than he will be listed as the father and would have to pay child support and all the other stuff. However if the father is not informed about the fact that the mother is pregnant with his child and is only informed after the birth than he does not have to take care of the child in any way. In this case the father can still sign the thing (contract?) that makes him the father in the eyes of the government without input of the mother. The mother can also sign away their responsibility of the child to the father (this must also be done before the birth and if done after birth the father must be in agreement otherwise the mother must pay child support). All of these can be signed after the birth as long as both the father and mother are in agreement. If both the father and mother do not want the child they will then be allowed to have an abortion or the baby will be put up for adoption after birth.

My experience with the difficulties of feminist men's communities,"Let me start off by saying I have been an active feminist for decades, but over the last 5-10 years my interest in men's issues has grown. I think feminism has been built on a solid foundation and developed a lot of useful tools and concepts.

However the difficulty I have with feminist communities is lack of willingness to introspect or address toxicity within the community. I have been a member of /r/MensLib for quite a while now, and have heard many members discuss this problem. However, these posts are almost always deleted.

For me the last straw has been recently. About a month ago I made a thread discussing the issue, but it was swiftly closed by a mod and said hat the tone was too much about feminism and not enough about men's issues. To me discrimination against men is absolutely a men's issue, and discrimination from feminists is an extremely pressing issue.

After about 3 weeks I had thought about it a lot, and discussed with many other users. At that time I decided to make a new thread, being extremely focused on the issue at hand, and making it clear my problem isn't with feminism as a whole but only with sexism.

Disappointingly, this thread was closed within a few hours. The reason the mods gave this time was that it wasn't ""concrete enough"" and a bit of ""gender war"". I sent several messages over the next week looking for clarification and to ask for help to improve the thread. This culminated when the mods made it clear: 

&gt;We don't allow posts that focus on feminism, because fundamentally feminism as a movement is not about men. There are times and places that constructive criticism of specific feminist spaces or movements can be appropriate, but when a post on our subreddit is about feminism or about experiences in feminist spaces, it inevitably winds up being unproductive and attracting a huge anti-feminist contingent, regardless of how benign the intentions were behind the post. 

This is extremely disheartening for me. The community had been built with the assertion that the focus is on men. Here is a quote from the MensLib wiki that I strongly agree with:

&gt;MensLib is a movement and community specifically to identify, discuss, and address men's issues, and to support men. Because women and women's issues are often closely related to men's issues, they often are introduced into our discussions by way of complement or contrast‚Äîbut our priority is always on helping men and tackling the issues they face. 

Unfortunately, it seems that the opinion of the staff has changed since that wiki was made.

I feel I am at a great loss. I am not certain that a feminism-allied movement can truly address men's issues if their first priority is to shield feminism from criticism. I don't think that oppression of men is something that should be ignored. Although I have had many problems with the MRA community in the past, at the moment I feel it is the only men's movement that can truly address sexism in all forms.

While I think that feminism is compatible with true equality, I do not think that feminist communities can help move equality for men forward (besides standing aside and being allies). 

For reference, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/ks5yvg/struggling_with_sexism_within_our_community_at/) is the second thread, and I have pasted the OP below:

&gt;As a feminist interested in men's issues, I find one of the biggest barriers to progress is our own communities. It feels very difficult to talk about men's issues in feminist spaces, and moreover difficult to criticize problematic behavior within the community without it being reframed as either being ""anti-feminist"" or ""you just don't like that person"".  
&gt;  
&gt;In particular, I find this problem is worst when a high-profile female feminist expresses anti-male sentiments and a male feminist attempts to address the problematic behavior. In this situation the woman is defended, while the male is silenced. I think this makes the problem worse by reinforcing the idea that the problematic behavior is correct, and that those saying it isn't are just sexists. It also emboldens those who hold similar opinions. There simply isn't the community support to combat anti-male sentiment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Without the ability to address sexism within our own movement, it's difficult to imagine we can make serious progress in society at large. This is an issue I've been struggling with, and talking to both feminists interested in male issues and feminists in non-male rights communities has only made me feel less confident about my ability to combat sexism, and our movements ability to combat it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for any opinions, advice, or points of view anyone can offer. I appreciate it a lot!",208,0

Dear America...,"Now that the election is over, and the leftist ideological cabal - feminism, socialism, corporatism, social justice, BLM, Antifa, etc - have taken control, how long will it be until you stop blaming everything on white males?

A few more questions:

1.  How much do you want, up front, as a one-time payment for all the perceived ills?  From reparations for slavery, to sexism, racism and all the other crimes of people who have long since died?  Name your price!

2. If you refuse to take money up front as a final payment, then what are you asking for?  You just seized control on a global scale. The Oligarch's now have control, and control of all social media, all legacy media, all of the banks and banking systems, and almost everything else.  What more are you asking for? 

3. Men in the first two decades of the 21st century have paid, and paid hard, for simply being fathers and husbands. They are the sole net providers of tax dollars, and they overwhelming occupy the most dangerous job positions in the Western world- black, white, Latino and all other men. If this subjugation is not enough. What do you see as the final answer? How much more suffering will be necessary to erase the debts of our ancestors?

4. Media ridicules white males on a constant basis - all day, every day, in bizarre ways - how much ridicule will be enough? Do you have an end game here or should we expect permanent underclass status?

Many men would like simple clear answers to these questions (and others), but anyone who has insights here would be most welcome. I think most men would appreciate honest answers.


Dear Men Reading this.

I suggest you buckle up. Because the likely answers to these questions, if the left were being honest are the following:

1. We don't want to be paid off. We want men to work as long as they live, for as far into the future as we can exploit them, and we want to steal from them at will through taxation and court judgements. You will NEVER be free.

2. The subjugation of all men, everywhere for the benefit of women and the wealthy for all eternity. We want you as a permanent underclass and to shut up about it.  

3. It was never about paying off the past. We want to take what is yours and in order to get enough votes to do so, we have to make it sound like you are benefiting more than others. That riles people up and makes your very existence seem unfair.  We accomplished this. Now shut up and get back to work. Loser.

4. You as an underclass IS the end game. We are about 90% there now. Enjoy the 10% while you can.  If you are extremely good looking, or one of the wealthy elite, then you are in the top 3%. The other 7% we keep there as an example of how men have it so good, to keep the peasants from complaining.

I believe the best way to fix the issues with gender equality toward men is fixing the disparity in dating and desire,"Every man knows this, most women have so many options and most men often don‚Äôt have one. You go on a women‚Äôs tinder and she has 10 times as many matches as you have. Women are discussing with her friends at the bar about which guy to go back with, and most men are hoping one women gives them the time of day. Why is this the case? What can be done to fix this? I believe I can explain this and provide a solution.

Let‚Äôs first start with male and female biology and psychology. Women are attracted based on emotions and men are attracted based on looks. Obviously looks and how the person makes you feel matters to both men and women, but this is what it takes for men and women to decide if they would be willing to sleep with each other. This is stuff that goes back to our cavemen days. Most guys though are mediocre to clueless on how to attract a women. Women however don‚Äôt need to know how to do anything but look good. Most girls look good enough to at least have some guys hitting them up. Men are hoping just one responds. Here is the core issue with this:

Men want to win the girl over and then have her wanting to come back. Women want to be won over and then when they are, they become emotionally invested in the guy. She wants to then chase down this guy afterwards to make him hers. A perfect dating world is men can all feel confident talking to women to have options and then women can have guys that are interested they can chase and try to win over. Women still like all the attention for sure. Who wouldn‚Äôt get an ego boost with so many people wanting you. That‚Äôs why girl‚Äôs egos when it comes to dating is so high. Any person with that kind of attention will look at themselves as the prize to these people. Women hardly act on a man that chases and comes off as him needing her. 

The dating world needs an equal but different ego boost for guys and girls. Guys can feel ego boosts from getting the girl and getting her to come back for more. Women can get theirs from guys approaching and showing interest in them. A man should work to get her interested and a women should work to keep a man‚Äôs interest. The problem is, this ideal world would never be possible with the current dating disparity that exists between men and women. This disparity gives women unique power in the dating world. They can get away with what many men would consider ‚Äúunattractive‚Äù qualities as compared to men. 

Zodiac signs for instance is one thing I think most guys don‚Äôt care about or flat out dislike when a girl is way too into it. If you just like it for the fun of it but understand it is not real and don‚Äôt take it seriously, that‚Äôs cool. However, there are so many girls whose personalities are shaped by their zodiac sign. That is so unattractive to me as well as most other men. I also don‚Äôt want to talk about zodiac signs online or on the first date at all. Think about it like this, unless a women said she is a big football fan, don‚Äôt talk about last nights game on the first date. To me, it is the equivalent of something to talk about in depth with your girlfriends later on in certain circumstances and not with guys you‚Äôre just meeting. The thing is, unlike men talking about ‚Äúbro‚Äù stuff on the first date or in messages before meeting, women can talk about something like zodiac signs and still have interest from lots of guys. 

The main point I am trying to prove here is men can‚Äôt get away with not being the type of guy women want as compared to women who can get away with not being the kind of guy men want. If the disparity in dating did not exist, this would not exist. Men with lots of dating options will not give women with bad qualities the time of day beyond more than sex for the most part. If all men had options like how women do, we would be able to naturally reduce female toxicity in relationships the way women can with men. If no simps were out there rewarding the toxic girl, it would force her to change or suffer the fate many men out there have which is being alone. It‚Äôs bigger than just in relationships too. If nearly all men had enough options to feel confident about turning down the crazy feminists, then there would be real life punishment for the toxic viewpoints. 

I believe the end of quarantine is the time men need to make this happen and take charge. We have a unique opportunity where so many women have not been flirted with in real life for over a year and are dying for it. We as men have to get off of dating apps where women have control over whether you will even match and get a chance and just go out and talk to women in real life. I am not just talking picking up girls at bars and nightclubs, I am talking just meeting girls during the day, having fun conversations, and getting numbers to set up dates. Most men however don‚Äôt know how to properly do this because it was never taught to us. As men, I believe this is something we should all know and we need to make as mainstream as possible as fast as possible. 

Women do a great job making information about looking best for a man mainstream. Every woman knows exactly what soaps to use for reducing pimples, best makeups, etc. They all know how to look a certain way to attract men who are attracted to what they see. Men need to make information about attracting a women based on how we make her feel mainstream. I think just teaching young men from a young age in high school just how to talk to women in a very general sense when there is less pressure and women don‚Äôt even know what they want yet is how we fix this. There are so many youtube channels and course teaching all these methods and ideas to get the hottest girls and most men watching those videos just want to understand how to talk to women in general. We need to teach men the baby steps when they are babies in the dating world. 

I notice so many guys in high school or middle school either feel like it is hopeless or just don‚Äôt care and they should. The truth is, many of the guys that seem to get girls easily in college and later on in life did many cringy things in high school that would have cost them later on. As a man, you have to go through these things when you can get away with them to an extent which is high school. Many men either don‚Äôt learn the basics or don‚Äôt try to and when they really want a girl in college, everyone else is far ahead of them and they have the dating knowledge of a 16 year old. It is quite hard to become great for a 25 year old when you haven‚Äôt even approached a girl in real life before. Expecting someone to go from that to master pickup artist is crazy and unrealistic. 

So to conclude, I believe this is how the disparity can be fixed: men need to learn right now how to approach women in real life and take full advantage once quarantine is over and we need to teach high school kids to very basics so they can learn all the other things naturally through experience. We need to teach men in general how to become their best selves before they are in their 20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs and never learned how to get women and have to play catchup which is so incredibly hard.",16,0

Definitions of Feminism,"Obviously, the dictionary definition is a smokescreen. Feminism has never been about equality. John the Other's definition would seem to pretty accurate:

‚ÄùA doctrine built on the pre-supposition of victimhood of women by men as a foundation of female identity. In its goals is always the utilization of the state to forcibly redress this claimed victimization. In other words, the proxy use of violence and wealth appropriation. In whatever flavor, and variation, these two basic features are common to every doctrine using the label feminism. Feminism is therefore, a doctrine of class hatred, and violence.‚Äù (John The Other, ‚ÄúWhy not date a feminist?‚Äù A Voice For Men, 4 June 2012.)

"Why do people automaticaly identify the topic of ""gender equality"" exclusively with feminism?","I study medicine, and beside useful subjects i also have a lot of useless faculties, one of them being sociology. For today's class, a group of my peers had to give a lecture on ""gender as an aspect of social stratification"".

If i were to prepare that lecture, i'd want to compare inequalities men and women face, how could it affect their social position, and then leave it up to the students to make up their own minds on who is more disadvantaged in our society. I figure this is the most fair and objective way to approach that topic.

Unfortunately, doing anything of sort didn't even crossed my peers' minds. Their lecture was a long, feminist rant of both real and imagined inequalities women face, that only mentioned men in context of opressors and a problem that needs to be taken care of.

There was no mention of inequalities in labor market causing men to take up more dangerous jobs, no mention of how women are given exclusive parental rights in 60% of cases opposed to 5% of men, no mention of inequality in retirement age and a system that treats men like disposable work machines, no mention of how men are forced to parttake in military and are treated like disposable within it, no mention of any other issue that men face.

Instead we got gender wage gap, glass ceiling, toxic masculinity and even manspreading. Why do people only identify gender equality with feminism? Why does everybody refuses to acknowledge problem men face?",248,0

I'd like to use this post as a catalysator to inspire setting up more MRA websites in the countries where there still aren't and to advertise and raise awareness about the present ones. Those are just examples. Among others, in the Anglosphere, Latin America and Spain are also numerous respectively.

Therefore many MRA websites have already existed before, especially in major countries, but there's still a lack in many others, especially minor ones. They can be used as an information and news source (on a national level), as communication plattforms, meeting other MRAs from your country, as a hub for organizing protest marches or MRA conferences and public activism, etc.

Maybe you feel like setting up one in your country too, up to you, feel free about it üòÅ",12,0

"One area that feminism has failed to liberate women is around childcare. And I don't think this is a coincidence. Everything considered equal, the trade-offs that parents make greatly benefit women at the expense of men.","The focus on unpaid and emotional labor that feminists talk about actually reinforces traditional gender norms, including the providership gap, the wage gap, and the child care gap.

And while you often see feminists talk about these gender norms, it's usually only done as a way to attack men and paint it as something that harms women, which then prevents men from objecting to it and pointing out how unfair it is.

Instead of seeing this dynamic as exploitive, women everywhere use feminist rhetoric it to justify their lifestyle as ""earned"" through their unpaid and emotional labor (which is a very similar argument that traditionalists use). Men are encouraged to work and do more because their wives and girlfriends cook and clean. It's only fair that he works an extra 10 hours a week and does the yard work because she spent her time caring for him and cooking him dinner.

As a result, men don't have the social capital to say, ""this isn't fair, I think you need to work more, and let me stay home more"". The fact that she works less is justified by this messaging in society, and is then ultimately blamed on him, instead of her life decisions.

She then reaps the rewards in the form of less stress, a better work-life balance, more time at home, more time with the kids, guaranteed financial support, a better home life, better health outcomes, better social support from networking, a longer life, and implicit biases in family court.

That's not to say that there aren't mothers out there giving it their best. But the road that turned them into homemakers is paved by feminism, not the actions of men, or the patriarchy.

[At best, feminism has found an ally with traditionalism, which also helps to reinforce this gender dynamic.](https://www.wokefather.com/egalitarianism/the-embrace-of-new-traditionalists-and-feminists-female-privilege/)

What was the most gruesome crime you have ever learned of?

Trigger warning

The man in the picture is Dan Shisia Matakhaya, a 31 year-old Kenyan police officer.

Ôøº

He was not born with this frightening appearance. What you see is the result of a normal argument he had with his wife.

One day, Matakhaya and his wife disagreed about a house issue. He considered it as a normal argument and later on that day, he left for work. He had a night shift so he came back home the day after, at 05:30 am.

As he had been working all the night, he went straight to the bed to sleep.

This is the moment his wife chose to come and pour acid solution on his face. Then she ran away. But it was not enough for her to spoil his face, she also acted so that he couldn't escape the bedroom. She had poured water on the floor and connected it to electricity. As soon as Matakhaya stepped on the floor, he felt the electric shock.

As he was screaming, his neighbouring workmates came and found him in his despair. They took him to hospital. His life was saved, but unfortunately not his eyes. Now he is permanently blind.

His wife was firstly arrested, then they released her later on bail. Matakhaya forgave her for what happened but he said he is not going to abandon charge against her. He only met her at the court and all she said was that she doesn't know why she did so.

It is absolutely frightening, absolutely insane, absolutely baffling that women can do basically anything and have a chance of having some white knight cops and lawyers and judges excuse their behavior and just release them on bail. The bail thing is stupid in its own right, but this takes it to a whole new level.",1,0

I'm so frustrated,"This is a post about the results of my argument about Men's Rights and Feminism with my friends. It doesn't contain any new information, study or anything relevant. Read this only if you are curious.

I'm a young male and I'm part of a group of friends, all of the same age. We've been friends for longer than 10 years and always openly talked about many subjects. Recently the topic of feminism was brought up because the girlfriend of one of us (also present in the group) decided to share an instagram post about ""fight for WOMEN in domestic violence"". I knew it wasn't going to be an easy pill to swallow but I decided to comment about it and share my views which go in line with some of the arguments also shared here about the issue.

The group has 10 people, 7 dudes (me included), 3 dudettes. It turned into a conversation about HOW WRONG I AM, about HOW OPPRESSED WOMEN ARE and that I'M BLINDLY OPPOSING WOMEN. In that conversation, half were mostly quiet, but the 3 girls and 2 guys were completely vocal against me. SO I decided to bring some numbers up. They started ranting about the validity of those sources, accusing them of lying (numbers about domestic violence comparing men on women and women on men) or accusing the numbers of not being relevant to the conversation (in case of male suicide rate). They rejected the thought that there's no gender based oppression and quite passionately defended that the society was male dominant and female oppressed.

At some point I concluded, there's no argument possible, they just don't want to listen and/or don't want to know/care. So I just shared thetinmen page, the red pill documentary and left the conversation. Now I'm still collecting my thoughts but I'm so sad. I'm realizing that the world is unfair and there are lots of problems but the blame isn't on the 1%, the blame is on the 99% being fucking sheep and preferring to talk before studying and reflecting. I always had a subconscious idea that the ones who I have enough closure to call friends were integral people with whom I could share my views and have a factual argument where it would be possible to reach a logical consensus based on evidence. I'm wrong and I feel lonely.",47,0

Study claiming men are better off after divorce is deceptive,"Some recent posts here and on r/askfeminists have cited [an article in the Guardian](https://web.archive.org/web/20201109021615/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/25/divorce-women-research) that purports to show men are actually better of after separation. With the replies on r/askfeminists heavily censored.

It turns out the article is a masterclass in fake news.

The study cited does not include child support payments. This seems a curious omission, when this was the main complaint given by divorced fathers at the time of the study [see here](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/divorced-fathers-fight-back-over-maintenance-mp-calls-for-review-as-new-child-support-rules-take-their-toll-on-hardpressed-parents-1509072.html).

After divorce men are forced to work more hours to pay the child support, but receive less disposable income because of it. After divorce women may give up any work they have resulting in less income from work - but they still may have a higher disposable income because of the child support.

Counting money women receive and men pay as money men receive, seems highly negligent if not deceitful.

Are modern women and feminists contributing to the rise of men who identify as incel?,"Before anyone blows up at this question, and wants me banned because I identify as incel, I'm simply asking a question and seeking out some honest answers and discussion.

I've spent a fair amount of time in both incel and MGTOW forums over the course of the past few years and there seems to be a common thread amongst both, which is that women today have some very unrealistic high standards and requirements when it comes to dating men, much of this which is be propagated by modern feminism that all women are special and entitled to the very best of high value men they wish to pursue a relationship with, regardless of their own value or what they bring to the table themselves. Therefore there's a whole pool or men which seems to be rapidly growing, who feel they're completely unwanted and unworthy of any type or romantic relationship with women, because the ladies are telling these guys they're just not good enough. This only fuels an already depressed bunch of men into a rage of bitterness and anger, which can sometimes lead to misogyny and hate towards females for being too superficial and vain, which then get stereotyped into a bunch of basement dwelling lazy adult men, which I've found not to be entirely the case with so many of them.

MGTOW's will even acknowledge that there are guys women will right-up reject for not being good looking enough, or that these kind of men are told to wait until they've had their fun in their 20's and early 30's, and will settle down with them when they're no longer desirable to the hot guys they no longer attract, which in way seems to correlate to the same conclusion, only a certain select number of men are even worthy of women's attention in todays dating market.

This points me to Men's Rights Activist Karen Straughan, who said the following...

[***""I know guys who are 35 years old, who are virgins, they have good jobs, they want to have a family, they want to have a wife and kids, and they are just not going to be able to do that, and they know it. Because there is one flaw that would have been overlooked 50 years ago, they would have found some women, some homely, chubby woman who would have been willing to settle down with him, and now that's just not the case.""***](https://youtu.be/SrhgDQjxDaw?t=841) - [Karen Straughan](https://incels.wiki/w/Karen_Straughan)

Having heard this quote many, many times over the past year or so, it really makes me believe she is right in what she's saying, that the requirements women have today when seeking a male partner is ultimately contributing to more and more single and lonely men, many of which then fall into the rabbit hole that is inceldom.

Please discuss, as I really want to have a civil and well thought out discord about this. Thank you.",28,0

The ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù is little more than the projection of women‚Äôs desire for power and they subvert responsibility for this by unjustly placing it on men.,"Hierarchy 

‚Äî

In the female dominance hierarchy, women compete indirectly. All women have various ambitions, but keeping those ambitions secret is key to their success.

If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with how female dominance hierarchies work - just think about how women talk to one another *when they think no men are around listening* 

Women desire having power, status, control of a ‚Äúhigh value male‚Äù, and having more ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù than the other women in her social circle do. But they do not want to *look* like they are grabbing for power. When women have something that other women do not, they will often plot to find ways to either bring that girl down, or raise the rest of the group up to her level (‚Äúhey Jessica, does your new bf have any brothers or friends?‚Äù). Notice how jealous girls get when one of her friends gets a boyfriend. It‚Äôs not that the girls really care about having a specific guy for her, it‚Äôs more that they just want a boyfriend because someone else got a boyfriend. Refer to any of the dating subreddits for stories about this ad naseum...

The female dominance hierarchy is innate in females just as the competitive pecking order hierarchical process is innate in men. For guys, think about the instinctual, subtle cues and body languages that guys communicate to one another when first meeting - often times there is boasting between men to compare accomplishments and victories, to demonstrate status and competence. Much of this is automatic and you don‚Äôt even realize you‚Äôre doing this until after it‚Äôs been said - you probably rationalize by saying that you‚Äôre just making friendly conversation by talking about your interests. Women have their own hierarchy but it is nearly imperceptible to most men. It is this way likely because natural selection meant this was the most effective system for the human species to prosper in. 

‚Äî

Definitions

- Psychological projection - is a defense mechanism in which the ego defends itself against unconscious impulses or qualities by denying their existence in themselves by attributing them to others

- Cognitive dissonance - the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes, especially as relating to behavioral decisions and attitude change.

- Patriarchy - a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it.

‚Äî

Where do morals come from? No not philosophically - where do you first learn about morality? 

For the vast majority of people, it‚Äôs from their mom.

Most social etiquette, rules, norms, manners, etc. are communicated from the mother to the child. Most mothers are often repeating the lessons they were taught by their mother, tweaked by her life experience. Over the generations, an evolution of societal rules will culminate. The problem is that these ‚Äúrules‚Äù often get in the way of the dominance hierarchy. 

Sometimes this is good - Jessica gets a new BF? Guess if you murder Jessica, you could assert your dominance in the hierarchy.  Except one problem - someone decided that murder is bad (even though we find justifications for murder all the time throughout history). So, how do you ascend the hierarchy when many of the most effective tactics are against ‚ÄúThe Rules‚Äù and give you cognitive dissonance?

Subvert the rules by spreading a rumor about Jessica being a slut. Reputation destruction is a bullying tactic that is EXTREMELY common in women - as any woman can tell you if they ever were a teenage girl. This is not something they necessarily grow out of. Look at how politics are done today. Look at twitters cancel culture - which demographic primarily uses that?

If women desire power, and they have to compete with men, but their rules prevent them from overtly chasing power, they must instead subvert the rules by...who can guess it? Reputation destruction.

Instead of competing and grabbing for power and status as a man would - through honest competency and overt competition - many will instead victimize themselves and say that they are ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù and ‚Äúnot allowed‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have access to‚Äù, etc. for whatever it is they desire. 

Think about the wage gap - women STILL claim to believe that it‚Äôs about sexism when it‚Äôs been clearly shown, innumerable times, that employers cannot pay women less than men - if they could, every single employer would hire only women so that they could pay them less. Women, instead, *CHOOSE* careers that pay less on average than careers that men *CHOOSE* to go into.

Nope! It‚Äôs still the patriarchy 

How do women test their man? They make him chase and pursue her. They make him demonstrate his commitment to the idea that she is more special and more unique to him than other women. They mainly desire *his* desire. This also conveniently allows them to dance the line of plausible deniability if they don‚Äôt find him attractive enough - they can easily say that the man perused her and she tried to say no, but that damn patriarchy again forcing women to placate men and be subservient to their will! 


‚Äî

Conclusion


This system of victimization and blame shifting is the greatest example of Sun Tzu‚Äôs the art of war. Subvert subvert subvert. And we men are almost completely unaware of it. 

As time has gone on, the contradictory nature of feminism and women in general is starting to become more apparent. ‚ÄúPatriarchy‚Äù is little more than the projection of the female desire for power.

This dovetails nicely into male disposability theory as well. But that‚Äôa where I‚Äôll stop for today.",15,0

Brainstorm for a new project on men's rights,"I've been thinking on this idea for a time and I want to put it here on the table to discuss it.

**Motive**

I define feminism today as a politically motivated movement that abuses women, manipulating them, undermining their identity and ultimately rendering them vulnerable so indoctrination to their ideology and other forms of extremism becomes easy.

The vast majority of feminists, alienated by that very manipulation, become resented and hostile towards men, some of which also leaks down to non extremists but people that identify as feminists purely due to their definition which is virtuous.

The power for censoring of feminist lobbyist is deproportionate against our attempts to inform people, way too many new people adhere to ideology and the huge majority adhering to feminism are extremely resistant to different views. It's simply a losing battle.

Today I am deeply worried of having to put up with this for the rest of my life, and I honestly simply want out but I don't have the resources to be well informed about how to migrate to a more sane society where one can actually be a man and not be demeaned all day long every time I turn on the TV.

**The idea**

The idea I come to throw here it's to make an online map that properly analyzes and weigh what countries are still a place for men to actually live freely and not fearing false accusations, discrimination by law or general hostility in a day to day basis.

This map could be colored to demonstrate how hostile each country is to men, and all this information can be retrieved and analyzed to affect their score.

A list of ideas of aspects to document and to make up the scores of:

* Since when this country is Influenced by feminism.
* Is there a ministry for women issues?
   * Is it also the one supposed to dictate norms on gender equality?
* Successful lobbying against men
   * Laws
   * How they have influenced the media
   * How many feminists are in the media business
   * Interventions meant to manipulate gender views
   * Interventions with the intent of indoctrinating against men
* Properly referenced side to side comparisons
   * Reproductive rights by gender
   * Marriage rights and risks
   * A table of possible outcomes of trying to exercise a right, by gender
      * Both calculated by interpreting the law and by documented cases
* Media analysis and uploads
   * advertisement and demeaning campaigns
   * preferences and bias on the news
   * hostile reactions to males opinions
   * risk of being physically attacked
   * prevalence of feminism by level of extremism

Ideas of points to research by country:

* Death rate by suicide and other reasons
* Violence in relationships and who does law enforcement favor by default
* Fake allegations and their actual consequences
* Prison sentences by gender
* How the education system discriminates men
* Shelters and other help by gender

Assessed risk of feminism:

* Calculate how solid the culture is in respect of influenciability
   * Does the culture seem to celebrate effort and work
   * Does the culture seem to celebrate victimhood
   * How prevalent is fashion and shallow tendencies

This list is a work in progress and it would be great to be able to expand it with help from all of you.

This is of course a giant task that in no way I can take alone, but it's really needed so we can document this information and make its value last longer than the short lived but massive misinformation directed by feminist lobbyists.

Hopefully we get some Important Results.",5,0

What are your opinions on modern dating and whether it's worth the risk for a male in 2021,"To start, I'm 18 and come from quite a Catholic religious background, and although I still hold some principles from that time and some of the morals are ingrained in me, I'm not necessarily overly Conservative when it comes to relationships, so this question is directed to anyone of whatever orientation /religion, and I'd like it to be noted these are just my beliefs and opinions.

Over the last few years I've been quite hesitant about entering a relationship with anyone, I find it quite hard to trust a partner and overall feel that I am quite jealous, more so keeping jealous thoughts private but my actions can reflect how I'm feeling so I suppose it still needs work. In this way, I am very traditional in the belief that when you're with someone, you are tied to each other and have loyalty to one another. So these open relationship ideas I personally just see as an excuse to cheat and not feel bad about it. Then I also see an influx in young girls starting onlyfans accounts and degrading themselves online, which again I don't think personally I could be with some who shows themselves freely or for profit to others online without first being in a dedicated relationship with them.

I believe these are logical stances to hold but I'd like to hear from others as well.

Now when it comes to the following, I don't like that I think these things but admittedly it is going through my head so here's my more illogical issues:
I'm not comfortable with the idea of thinking about a partners previous sexual history. I dread the day that I'm with a girl for example, meet another dude and they can say ""ha I did x or y, with your gf"". This would be childish and immature yes but there are undoubtedly people like this in the world so I'm not sure how I'd approach a situation like that, which brings in the idea of ""leaving sex till marriage"" which I'm not completely against but THEN you come across the issue of should modern men even be considering marriage due to the unfairness of divorce settlements and the average outcome of relationships at the moment.

I see a lot of men (and women tbf but I'm speaking from my perspective) having a lot of trust issues when it comes to choosing a partner nowadays and it seems like society is just focused on quick hook ups and casual sex based on pure lust and nothing else.

But I've experienced relationships that have meant a lot to me and it seems an awful shame to sacrifice the notion of a future with someone you could potentially care a lot about merely due to the possible negative outcomes.

That's my thoughts, I apologise if they are sort of scattered I needed to rant. I would truly appreciate any anecdotes or opinions from others as to their opinions or positions on effective dating in 2021",32,0

As ive posted before, teachers mark girls higher for IDENTICAL work, to the point where just changing to a.girls name gets a boy 1/3 grade higher mark. as well as punishing boys differently. See below for all the studies. What do you expect when feminsim teaches extreme misnadry, male privelge theory etc.... that feminise teachers will be like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Previous submission got deleted by mod eventually so reposting here... still check it out as many excellent comments from men and women about their experience of this bias... many pointed out very obvious misandric comments from their teachers, some teachers even commented about their biases:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers\_mark\_girls\_higher\_for\_identical\_work\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/)

This is an unpopular fact as it widely held in society that women and girls are discriminated against in education and in work, indeed in everything in life.

Note; below is general statement, countless awesome teachers but....

**Education is an example of institutional sexism. Now this data should to even feminist not be surprising... after all they call male majority and even female majority places as rife with sexism and ""male norms"" i.e. women have to act like men... is it any surprise then in teaching where 98% of early educators are female, 90% primary school teachers are female and these teachers have often studied gender studies type radical subjects at uni, and all HR and admin is female, that there is ""female norms"" being applied in education..... that the default child is a girl according to teachers? As the following data shows e.g. female teachers punishing boys for entirely normal behaviour that they dont understand; marking girls higher for IDENTICAL work, and giving higher predicted grades (despite boys objectively getting higher real life assesments) as they prefer girl students as model students and can relate to girl students better.... it is no wonder that schools are reducing play times, even removing physical education completely and replacing it with in class movement.... i.e. an entirely anti boy environment.... if 40% of boys are being drugged with aderal in some schools, do you think 40% of boys are unwell or maybe its the teachers who are shit and the system they made?**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Over then entire OECD countries globally, a large scale study showed that girls were given higher marks for IDENTICAL work to boys. OECD also showed that a boy receives 1/3 higher grade if the teacher does not know he is a boy. Interestingly this gender gap goes away when it is a male teacher doing the marking.

Cornwell found that boys in all racial categories are not being *‚Äúcommensurately graded by their teachers‚Äù* in any subject *‚Äúas their test scores would predict.‚Äù*

The answer lies in the way teachers, who are statistically mostly women, evaluate students without reference to objective test scores. Boys are regularly graded well below their actual academic performance.

Boys are falling significantly behind in grades, *‚Äúdespite performing as least as well as girls on math tests, and significantly better on science tests.‚Äù*

After fifth grade, he found, student assessment becomes a matter of *‚Äúa teacher‚Äôs subjective assessment of the student‚Äôs performance‚Äù*, and is further removed from the guidance of objective test results. Teachers, he says, tend to assess students on non-cognitive, *‚Äúsocio-emotional skills.‚Äù*This has had a significant impact on boys‚Äô later achievement because, while objective test scores are important, it is teacher-assigned grades that determine a child‚Äôs future with class placement, high school graduation and college admissibility.

Eliminating the factor of *‚Äúnon-cognitive skills‚Ä¶almost eliminates the estimated gender gap in reading grades‚Äù*, Cornwell found. He said he found it *‚Äúsurprising‚Äù* that although boys out-perform girls on math and science test scores, girls out-perform boys on teacher-assigned grades.

The report also found that:

* At primary level 85% of teachers are female. This has remained roughly the same since 2003.
* At secondary level the percentage of male teachers has fallen steadily at first and later precipitously from 40% in 2003 to 31.7% in 2012.

**It has been shown that boys and girls do better in reading when they have a same sex teacher. Just one year with a male teacher reduced the reading gap by 1/3 for 13 year old boys. It has als been shown:**

In another study in the work place researchers asked supervisors to grade two poorly written essays and to provide feedback directly to each writer over chat, so that the writer could improve. At this point, the writers' names (Andrew or Sarah) were revealed, revealing that one was a man, the other a woman. Participants submitted a grade to each writer, as well as substantive comments to improve their essays.

Participants were more likely to tell white lies to the woman writer,  **inflating Sarah's grades nearly a full letter grade higher than from their initial private evaluation. They also gave her more positive comments than they gave Andrew. In contrast, the man's in-person feedback was statistically indistinguishable from the participants' undisclosed evaluations of his work.**

**Please note:** When this study was reported, it was reported as being discrimination towards women as their performance was being upgraded and they weret being given correct feedback, rather than the more obvious statement, that men are being disrimnated against and women work is being marked up.

Boys 'being held back by women teachers' as gender stereotypes are reinforced in the classroom

[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1307856/Boys-held-women-teachers-gender-stereotypes-reinforced-classroom.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1307856/Boys-held-women-teachers-gender-stereotypes-reinforced-classroom.html)

Christian Hoff Sommers explains how boys are being punished for normal behaviours:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFpYj0E-yb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFpYj0E-yb4)

Do Schools discrimiante against boys: Dr. Jim Dueck, author, former Assistant Deputy Minister of Education for the province of Alberta, and former head of Accountability and Student Assessment, performed a revealing analysis on current practices in student assessment. The results were not only remarkable but very disturbing, exposing what might well be an institutional suppression of the performance of male students.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ)

Related, despite a widely held view to the contrary, in a large scale national study, women are favoured 2:1 over IDENTICAL or even slightly more qualified men in STEM applicationss but gender BLIND helps men significantly, and the latter is now becoming less commonly applied as a result.

[https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360)

This could go to explain why many prominent claims of discrimination have failed as there is a perceived bias but on investigation, this is proved false e.g. US womens football team equal pay claim led to the judge saying the women were paid more than men, or women suing Google only for Googles results to show they were paying mens less.

Funding:

Females given $6 billion per year more in grants by government for education despite being the overwhelming majoirty in university

[https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=13620&amp;fbclid=IwAR1zxexkrfKy5VeGcW0IC-hUy6mgUMQS4F8di\_Eyk3ZDt2jhMVgtTcX6WcA](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=13620&amp;fbclid=IwAR1zxexkrfKy5VeGcW0IC-hUy6mgUMQS4F8di_Eyk3ZDt2jhMVgtTcX6WcA)

There are also 11 female only scholarships per 1 male one, with some universities have 100 female only scholarships and none for men, again despite men being a minority in university, and in alsmost all courses (even in STEM technically men are a minority, its only a few specfic subjects e.g. physics, computer science that men are a majority while women are a majority in Medicine, Biology, Nursing, Psychology, Veteniary Medicine etc)

**At home (similar ins school):**

Boys are more likely to receive corporal punishment from their parents then girls ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952896/)). They are also, in general, more likely to recieve severe verbal and physical punishment from both mothers and fathers ([source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227312033_Harsh_Discipline_and_Child_Problem_Behaviors_The_Roles_of_Positive_Parenting_and_Gender/link/55aeac6b08aed9b7dcdda4c0/download)). Some studies indicate the difference is less pronounced at the home and may be non-significant in the first years of infancy ([source](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/113/Supplement_5/1952.full.pdf)), but the difference is still present in the same direction as it is in schools for most of adolescence.

**Can something be done? Of course:**

[http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept06/vol64/num01/Teaching-to-the-Minds-of-Boys.aspx](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept06/vol64/num01/Teaching-to-the-Minds-of-Boys.aspx)

This school took a boy friendly approach. What was applied is explaied in detail. **Boys performance rocketed, gender gap went and girls performance went up nearly as much too.**Current system is bad for everyone but it just s happens it massively favours girls. I think it will get worse bad sterotypes about boys and now literally every other story about manspreading, mansplaining, toxic masculinty, menaretrash (real hashtag on twitter) all will not help. There is no political will... in the UK the head of uni admissions even said she thinks its a scandal no one is doing anything about plumetting uni levels for boys and if any other group it would be an outrage.... Uni of Arizona has 160 female only scholarships and 2 male ones despite women outnumbering men in almost every single degree... in the very few that they dont in STEM (not even all stem, for example more female medics, biology, vets) they are actively recruiting girls but doing nothing for boys

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school/)

Telegraph article on number of men in teaching, and techers openly admitting to sexism in favour of girls:

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html)

I do know from my own direct experience that many young women of the 1960s and 1970s went into teaching inspired by a feminist mission to raise the self-esteem and the social position of girls. I could name at least half a dozen women teachers I knew personally in the later decades of the last century who were proud to say that they favoured girls in class to make up for the oppression of women in the past. The moral dubiety ‚Äì and outright sexist prejudice - of inflicting second-class treatment on little boys who could bear no personal responsibility for those alleged (and profoundly questionable) historical crimes never seemed to trouble those apostles of equality. Men are hardly likely to become primary school teachers because they feel they owe a duty to their sex

By the same token, I can name a similar number of feminist commentators in the media/political establishment who celebrated the rise of educational attainments for girls in school as evidence that females are, by birth and nature, superior to males. As girls overtook boys in grades and exam results at all levels throughout the education system, those sisters were cock-a-hoop at their gender‚Äôs triumph ‚Äì never acknowledging that the advantage of one sex must have been bought at the expense of the other. Not one Secretary of State for Education in the last 40 years has expressed concern that the [gender divide in academic achievement ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/11364130/Girls-do-better-than-boys-at-school-despite-inequality.html)reflected a worrying ethos in schools that imposed disadvantage and inequality on boys. They wouldn‚Äôt dare.

Along with the politicians, men, as a whole, simply gave in to this feminist-driven growth of inequality with the bovine supinity which has characterised their outlook for the last half century.

So a guy my age was legit flirting with me for days and I mistook it for something else,"It was sometimes in November. I was waiting for the bus and asked him when the next bus would arrive. We started talking mainly about Tv shows and then about, music, military serivice, mental health, nutrition, normal stuff. He said I should watch Rick and Morty. We sat next to each other on the bus and I thought I had finally made a decent friend and even asked for his insta (j think that's when he got the wrong idea).At one point I told him he felt like an actual brother since my actual brother has schizophrenia.(before I knew what was going on). I the following days, his uncle died and i was genuinely saying how sorry I was.(again, I think this had a different unintentional effect in him). After noticing that I wasn't having it, He asked in a very vague, indirect way ""i may be wrong but.."" - I don't remember the exact words, but he basically tried to gaslight me into thinking that I was flirting with him, and that's when I laughed in disgust almost, (I have no problem with gay people at all, but I myself am straight) and jokingly asked if he had a crush on me, he said no. I thought it was just a misunderstanding. The next day I wrote him essay how I was sorry if I had given him the wrong impression, and that I was raised to be nice to everyone. I gave him some time after the funneral before invinting him for beers. He politely declined and then he ghosted me completely. It took me weeks before I realized what had actually happened so sadly, none of us got what we wanted. I just thought I'd tell this story here. Has anything similar ever happened to you guys ?",0,0

I want to discuss a bit,"First please don‚Äôt downvote this post to hell, I have very different opinions than people on this subreddit, I want to discuss.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of ""antifeminisme"" on this subreddit and I have to disagree, feminism is a good thing, some posts say that it‚Äôs a ""hate stuff thing"" there are a lot of feminist rally in my town and, even though I haven‚Äôt participated in them I have talked to a lot of people and some of my classmates are very activists, they where always very open to discussion and very kind.

The second point I see a lot is female rape is as big as male rape, now rape is a serious crime that can ruine a person‚Äôs life (that‚Äôs why we should take rape allegations seriously and not make fun of it, that‚Äôs why a lot of rape victims male or female are afraid of saying it) but in the US there are 7.7610058 times more female rape than women.

Than about women‚Äôs abusing men or straight out murdering them, same, according to this source: https://www.thehotline.org/stakeholders/domestic-violence-statistics/
women experience about 1/4 women are abused and 1/7 men are, that‚Äôs a pretty big difference.

My point isn‚Äôt that, what this subreddit seems to think feminism is, that we should put men and women to the same stage, like if you want to make bill gates and some random dude equal, we shouldn‚Äôt give 10‚Äô000 bucks to both

You should talk more to people who have a different opinion. Oh and btw have you ever bed insulted, someone ever said something sexist to you or almost sexually assaulted you in the street because of your sexe ? I haven‚Äôt, all my friends haven‚Äôt but girls have to deal with this a lot.

Toxic Masculinity Doesn't Exist - An Essay,"Toxic Masculinity doesn't exist.  Don't even acknowledge the term.  It's specifically used as a dog-whistle to automatically associate negative traits with masculinity.  Sort of like ""deplorables"" was used by Hillary to disenfranchise poor white voters, how the term ""thugs"" is currently used as a placeholder for the ""n-word"" by racist idiots,  and the sarcastic use of ""religion of peace"" is used by racist losers to refer to Muslims in the media,  the terms aren't meant to explain or highlight any sort of behavior as much as they are used to associate negative traits with certain groups and encourage irrational hate against them.  It's a trigger word used to do what females do best: **causing divisions by way of Relational Aggression.**

&amp;#x200B;

These terms are a form of relational aggression.  They're trying to encourage a culture where open discrimination against men in public places like work and school will be acceptable.  If it becomes publicly acceptable, it's going to become a word used to do nothing other than shame men.    


It should be as offensive to you to have that term ***even be used in public***, just like it is to refer to blacks as ""thugs,"" poor whites as ""deplorables,"" or sarcastically use the phrase ""religion of peace"" when referring to Muslims or Middle Easterners.  Imagine actually using those terms RIGHT NOW in your workplace, school, or other public places.  You would get CRUCIFIED because they absolutely are horrible terms to use and their connotations are KNOWN.  Everyone knows they are placeholders for more hateful words use by trashy low-lifes at the fringes of society.  


Feminists look at *""strong""* female role models and refer to them as ""positive, encouraging, empowering""  but men who have those exact same traits, if they're even allowed to exist in mainstream media anymore, are referred to exhibiting ""toxic masculinity"" ONLY because they're men and for no other reason.  Don't let misandry be publicly acceptable behavior online or in real life.   


Don't answer to or acknowledge the term Toxic Masculinity - it's a losing proposition.  You're getting bullied into working against yourselves by acknowledging it exists.  By answering to it, you're opening the door that allows those conversations to happen and for the environment I explained above to flourish.  Toxic masculinity doesn't exist and anyone that does use it should be looked down on and shut-out.",7,0

Military / Child support and custody battle,"Hey I am joining the Army this month, and will be going in while fighting a bit of a legal battle.

Experiment (MRA side),"OK, so I'm conducting an experiment with this subreddit and r/Ask Feminists. I already know some cases of discrimination against men, such as with false rape allegations, family court, reproductive rights and non-reciprocal cases of domestic abuse and intimate terrorism. Can you give some more examples of cases where men are clearly discriminated against or at a disadvantage where there aren't any uncontrollable variables are at play? And as an aside, do you think gender and race quotas are doing more harm or good? 

For the aside, I don't agree with the gender and race quotas. While they do get POCs jobs, they will never know whether it was on their own merit or if the company decided that they had 'too many white people' or 'too many men'.
 That could cause them to second guess themselves, which could lead to mental health issues down the line, especially anxiety. Also, it means that there might have been a white man who worked his ass off for his degree and prepped himself for the interview, who was relying on the company to hire him since he was qualified for a job they wanted. And he was dismissed because of his skin colour. And if he doesn't know about the diversity quotas, then he would assume that he wasn't the best candidate, so he may delve into unhealthy habits and develop mental health issues of his own, most likely depression.

 So what's the outcome? The POC works at a job they feel like they didn't earn, the white man is unemployed, and both develop mental problems.

"Why are all old people so damn toxic to young men, and why do you think America is failing?","I've noticed that especially aimed towards men, old people are just absolutely cancerous. After having lived with my aunt to help keep her at home for a year, I figured out fast how disgusting old people can be. Ignorant, stupid, childish, rude, demanding, and then add in some hatred of young people and you get an old person. I think they're far outliving their normal age limit thanks to the medical advances fucking all younger people over. We get our inheritance later, we have trouble having children and caring for them, because our parents expect us to drop everything and help care for them 10-15 years, and we get oppressed by an older population that won't let us change the country in the ways we want to. Honestly, that last part is the worst of it. Too many old people hold down the best jobs, and are still in positions of power. Their thinking is incredibly archaic, and doesn't line up with 90% of younger men and women in America. Why is there even a minimum age limit imposed on our presidents? I don't want Joe Biden at his age to be president. He's ancient and his policies are going to favor what old people want, and not the young people that have to deal with them.

This is just my personal experience with older people, and I'm sure many of you haven't dropped everything to try and help someone you thought you knew and cared about. It can be really really terrible. I gained weight, I lost income to help care for her, I had next to no free-time, and I was constantly insulted for being a young man, which I heavily resented her for and still do. Do any others think that old people are really just destroying the country for the younger generation? If not, what else can you blame for the way the country has been heading? Birth rates are down, feminism is up, hatred of men is up, and we're finally seeing people leaving America in droves.

Also, has anyone wondered where exactly our taxes are fucking going? One of the highest taxes in the world and yet we still have nothing to show for it. Where's our cheap healthcare? Where's our fast public transportation like bullet trains? If I lived in Europe, I could visit many different cities by train and add some variety to my life. In America, I have to drive on crowded freeways for hours and deal with the constant threat of a wreck. America seems far behind the times thanks to companies wanting to milk car, gas, and oil sales for as long as possible. I do think America needs to purge that shit and focus on actually improving social growth by improving public transportation and healthcare. Rework the fucking healthcare, for God's sake. It's terrible! I don't even care if every single car company leaves America because of public transportation, because where are they going to go? Not many other countries still need cars, so good luck to those money-grubbing bastards.",14,0

He‚Äôs helped raise her daughter since she was 2.
She pushed (forced) them into a Poly relationship after their 1st year of marriage. 
(Can‚Äôt really call it poly if the husband doesn‚Äôt consent, huh?)
He went to care for his Dad with Dementia in Florida after a year in that situation but they kept in touch.
Then Covid hit and in March &amp; her Polyboy left to shelter with Family. 
She asked him to come up (to Connecticut) to be with her and her daughter. So he packed up the Florida apartment, flew his Dad up into a New Townhome, moved their stuff from the old apartment into the new home.
That was March. July she goes looking for a new guy and found ‚Äúthe one‚Äù in September. She‚Äôs been dating the new guy since. 

He‚Äôs had enough and he‚Äôs divorcing her in February. The daughter, now 14, ‚Äúseems‚Äù to be taking everything in stride but tells him she‚Äôll miss him so much after he moves.

I‚Äôll show him this post after a week of comments. The reason: I want him to know it wasn‚Äôt just coming from me. That‚Äôs why I stated this as informatively as possible.

What do you think are the most positive forms of masculinity?,"It's true that some socially constructed ideas of masculinity (perpetuated by both men and women) end up hurting men. However masculinity isn't inherently bad, and rather than focussing on the negatives we should celebrate the positives. 

So what do you think is the most positive masculine trait?

Personally, I like self-confidence. To me the ""manliest"" men are those who aren't afraid of what society thinks of them or what they will be labelled. Who aren't afraid of being called gay, or dressing weird, and acting like a clown. To me there's nothing more manly than not giving a shit what people think about you. And I think that's a positive thing, and everyone in society should be more confident in themselves.",18,0

How do I support men‚Äôs rights without sounding like an MRA,"On mobile, pardon funky stuff
I‚Äôve always thought of myself as a egalitarian, and when I was younger that believe mostly pertained towards women, though in recent years I‚Äôve begun to notice the men‚Äôs issues and care more deeply about them, as I see them as a bigger threat at the moment. Recently I‚Äôve been watching a bunch of Sydney Watson, shes charismatic, and when it comes to men‚Äôs rights, she‚Äôs not overly red-pilled, though some of her content is. For a while I have been trying to defend both sides of the spectrum, but as a white male, I am finding increasing struggles defending men and coming off as an ‚ÄòMRA‚Äô

Of course, I should specify why I don‚Äôt want to sound like an MRA. I‚Äôm sure many of us understand the difference between a lot of people who support men‚Äôs rights, and MRA‚Äôs, where MRA‚Äôs can be a lot more violent and toxic, or follow in third wave feminism‚Äôs footsteps and practice equality through putting down women, and not picking men up.

I want to support my fellow men in a constructive, helpful way that when talking to misandrists, actually ring a bell, so that they can‚Äôt just dismiss me as a sexist/misogynist. So if anyone has learned to walk this fine line, of supporting men in a way the opposite side doesn‚Äôt see as opposition, but instead a means to the same end goal-equality",33,0

Good movies/shows for young boys?,"Hi everyone,

Been fighting to see my son for 3 1/2 years now after his mom abducted him to her home country. 

Since I applied for the return of our son to his country of residence under the Hague convention, she has waged a brutal war of attrition, using all the classic tools of the trade against me including false criminal accusations and parental alienation. 

What irks me most is that she is feminizing him by having him wear tiaras in public, wearing dresses, and buying him girls' toys like dolls and princess castles. 

He is a real boy though, and whenever he has the choice will always choose classic boy toys like cars, toy guns, Pokemons etc.... 

Lately he's been asking me to buy him girl tv-show related toys that I'm sure his mom is making him watch. 

I'll hopefully be seeing him soon and would like to introduce him to some male-positive tv shows/movies/cartoon series that I'm sure he'd prefer over his mom's choices for him. 

I was hoping for some advice from you guys regarding what I should look into for a boy his age (he's almost 7 now) that would show him that being a boy is ok and to role models that he can ""look up to"" when I'm not around.

My ex and I got into it nearly 2 years ago. She beat me up pretty good left a gash across my chest, bite marks and bruises, she had like 2 bruises from me trying to get her off of me. We both have pictures of the abuse. My mom tried reporting her to my ""mandated reporter"" social worker WHEN IT HAPPENED who did nothing about it.

The videos delete after so long, so she must've recorded on her phone from where I start getting her off of me. So the police cannot get the original video most likely unless they talk to the company who does the security footage as the original deleted. 

She reported me for Domestic Violence, Aggravated Assault, DV in the presence of a child, and criminal mischief all felonies, 2-3 weeks ago, and I got arrested and spent Christmas and a little over a week after that in jail before I was able to finally bail out. This all took place about 1.5-2 years ago. Her and I have been broken up for the last 6 months bc she cheated on me.

 I am in US on work visa and basically from india...

I had supported my wife to help her get masters in engineering after marriage... I had supported her father financially and medically whenever he used to hospitalized... I helped her brother to get job... I have a son from her...

She basically was angry on me that I am not leaving US and coming back to india to live with her parents... 

I my self is a victim of domestic violence... my wife used to hit me with baseball bat, punched me on chest and slapped me many times and used to give me blood scratches by her nails over my body .... 


Long story shot... she wants me to be her slave and when I finally decided to denied that ... she filed all kind of cases on me, parents, sister and her husband ( which is what you get in india... your whole family gets accused into false cases even though they have nothing to do with anyone of you).....

I am fighting my cases in india since 4 years during which I am also not able to speak or see my son due to court orders and many other issues...

I finally left any hope that I could ever talk to him... In india women gets maintenance for life and child support for very long time... I have been awarded maintenance order (to her and my son from date of filing so I have to pay her since 4 years cumulative money) ... that I have started paying right now... 


I am lonely, depressed due to that I had developed diabetes and many other medical lifestyle issues... I am trying to improve my self... I hope i will one day...


I am thinking this question since 4 years ... I did everything that society, law , people told me to do... 

I loved her.. respect and supported her and her family... give to her and her family in needs... respect all women in my life and office and female colleagues... I never cheated or involved with anyone else than my wife... I never went to prostitutes... 

I basically been a best man I can to her... but still for society and people I am a bad guy and looser father...


I wanted to kill my self but somehow come out of that thought... today I have seen a video where a so called rapist got mob justice where people penetrating stick in his ass and dogs eat his groins (penis and balls) alive.... where em he was shouting in pain and people force the clothes in his mouth.... now no body is sure whether he was proven rapist... I felt so much worse about it... I know a case where mob killed an innocent man and hanged him naked... later confessed by girl that she got afraid of her affair with another man and in hurry she lied about this man....but that guy got killed by mob...

I am really afraid of this world... where women‚Äôs words are reality and men‚Äôs innocence is a joke..

Feminists Censoring Logical Fallacies That Hurt Them,"Wikipedia and other pages have been manipulated into removing articles on logical fallacies that harm the feminist narrative.

The most evident one I've been able to find is the article on Apex Fallacy.  It is when people look at the highest positions of power (politics, CEOs, celebrity, etc) and see those positions are held by men. Then they falsely assume all men have that level of power when completely ignoring that it takes a lot of power and generational wealth to get those men into those places..

Why is it ignored? Because it weakens their argument to acknowledge women who were born into the same privlidge always had the same doors opened to them.  This helps secure funding for sexist scholarships, grants, and other government funded programs that ignore young men who never had those opportunities to begin with. It helps out underqualified women in positions of power and privilege they haven't earned.

&amp;#x200B;

It always seem like when there's something about female empowerment, there always has to be women who act patronizing to men because of it. No gender is better than the other. 

Yes, women can be strong and there's many women who are stronger than men are. But then our society needs to stop teaching men to put their lives at risk for only women and expect hem to risk their lives for women in order to support that fact. If women can protect themselves, then why do they need protection from men?

Women can't just act superior to men, and then expect them to help them when they need their help. You can't have your cake and eat it. 

That is what is annoying about our society. They try teaching men to protect women, while at the same time teaching women that they are strong and don't need men. They need to stick to one thing. 

As for the whole ""women can get pregnant and handle childbirth while men can't thing"" that's a stupid comparison. For one, men can't get pregnant, and two, every women handles giving birth differently, some handle it very well while others don't. Also, men are the reason why women get pregnant in the first place. If it wasn't for men, women couldn't get pregnant.",11,0

"Study: Women leaders did NOT do better at handling COVID and the reason it was claimed was due to sexism: hyper-focusing on good women, ignoring bad women, hyper focusing on bad men, ignoring good men (the study is generous, women leaders actually did significantly worse)","[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9102585/COVID-19-Countries-led-women-NOT-fared-significantly-better-pandemic.html?login#newcomment](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9102585/COVID-19-Countries-led-women-NOT-fared-significantly-better-pandemic.html?login#newcomment)

The reason this was sexist nonsense is because the original claim (women leaders better handled pandemic which was falsely claimed by a study then cited bu UN, WEF, Times, Guardian, BBC, etc) was:

1) Entirely false to being with

2) Due to Gamma Bias

# 1) entirely false to being with 

See here, not only did female leaders, but even higher female majority parliaments did worse:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/idz5ih/self\_according\_to\_european\_cdc\_and\_oxford/](https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/idz5ih/self_according_to_european_cdc_and_oxford/)

To be clear, to me with a brain THAT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN... there are countless factors, but it makes it even more hilarious those agenda drive fake researchers tried to say women did better, when they literally did worse.

The study saying otherwise was absurd in its logical gymnastics to try and paint a false picture: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ie5zng/fundamental\_analysis\_flaws\_underlying\_just\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ie5zng/fundamental_analysis_flaws_underlying_just_about/)

# 2) The reason: due to Gamma bias: 

[https://malepsychology.org.uk/2018/12/04/why-are-there-so-many-disagreements-about-gender-issues-its-usually-down-to-gamma-bias/](https://malepsychology.org.uk/2018/12/04/why-are-there-so-many-disagreements-about-gender-issues-its-usually-down-to-gamma-bias/)

Within the ‚Äúcelebration‚Äù cell, for example, the positive achievements of women are routinely celebrated as a gender issue. Within the same cell in the table, the positive actions and achievements of men are not similarly celebrated or gendered. For example, when a group of boys was recently rescued from dangerous underwater caves in Thailand, it was not reported as a gender issue or as a positive example of masculinity, despite the fact that all the rescuers were male.

In the ‚Äúvictimhood‚Äù cell, domestic violence against women, for example, is highlighted as a gender issue, whereas domestic violence against men is played down or completely ignored, despite the [substantial numbers of male victims](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-013-9194-1). When men make up the majority of victims (e.g. suicide, rough sleeping, deaths at work, addiction), the issues are not highlighted or portrayed as gender issues.

Within the ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù cell, male privileges are magnified in our media and politics as ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù whereas female privileges (for example relating to children and family life) are played down or ignored as gender issues.

The overall impact of gamma bias therefore, according to this hypothesis, is that masculinity is made to look significantly worse than it really is whilst simultaneously femininity is made to look significantly better than it really is.

What are the implications of the routine magnifying of the worst of men and minimising the worst of women? Well, for a start we might need to reconceptualise the ‚Äòcrisis of masculinity‚Äô as a crisis in our attitudes towards men and masculinity.

Let‚Äôs make 2019 the year we wake up to the need to explore our conscious and unconscious biases against men. We hope that the concept of gamma bias and the *gender distortion matrix* will help people to think more clearly about gender issues.",136,0

Edit: I should have added that in medical settings I think it is completely fine. In any matter pertaining to science/medicine/research is not a problem. This post is mostly about casual conversation and regular posts.

Edit 2: Happy New Year everyone! One last edit to clarify a bit more. This post is a rant. Plain and simple. I do not expect much to change after today, and no, I don't consider this the biggest issue on the list of world problems facing men Lol

I hope you all have a great, safe, and healthy 2021!",1,0

"Some sources on the sexual abuse of men and boys, part 4","**Studies demonstrating roughly gender parity in sexual assault victimisation**

[Sexual Aggression Victimization and Perpetration Among Female and Male University Students in Poland](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0886260515609583)

This is a 2015 study which examined the prevalence of victimisation and perpetration of sexual aggression since age 15 in a convenience sample of 565 Polish university students (356 females). While there was a larger gap in self-reported perpetration of sexual aggression, self-reported victimisation did not differ significantly by sex - the overall self-reported victimisation rate was 34.3% for females and 28.4% for males.

Broken down by coercive strategy, the highest victimisation rates were found for the use or threat of physical force (women: 23.1% and men: 20.5%), followed by the exploitation of their incapacitated state (17.6% and 11.7%). The victimisation rate was lowest for the use of verbal pressure (11.6% and 5.4%). Note that the victimisation rates for men and women when it comes to the forms of sexual aggression which involve force (experiencing unwanted sexual contact through use or threat of physical force and exploitation of incapacitated state) are virtually equal.

Their results regarding victimisation are broken down further in Table 2 by victim-perpetrator relationship and type of unwanted sexual contact. When one looks at gender differences at the item level, some interesting details reveal themselves.

A higher proportion of men than women reported unwanted sex from an (ex-)partner (10.8% and 6.8% respectively), a friend/acquaintance (9.8% and 4.3% respectively), and a stranger (6.9% and 1.4% respectively) through the threat or use of physical force. An equivalent or greater proportion of men than women also reported unwanted sex from an (ex-)partner (4.9% and 3.7% respectively), a friend/acquaintance (6.8% and 3.1% respectively) and a stranger (2.4% and 1.4% respectively) through the exploitation of their incapacitated state.

The present study examined sexual aggression victimisation and perpetration since the age of 15 in a convenience sample of 1,376 college students (886 women) from four public universities in Ankara, Turkey. Overall, 77.6% of women and 65.5% of men reported at least one instance of sexual aggression victimisation. ""With regard to the coercive strategies used by the perpetrator, the threat or use of physical force was the most commonly reported strategy, indicated by 73.8% of women and 62.1% of men, followed by the exploitation of the victim‚Äôs inability to resist, with 40.5% and 31.9%, respectively, and the use of verbal pressure, with 26.9% and 21.4%.""

[Violence and Sexual Coercion in High School Students' Dating Relationships](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007545302987)

The present study sought to investigate the extent of dating violence victimisation in a New Zealand sample of senior high school students and the perceived reasons for the violence, emotional effects, disclosure of the violence, and relationship consequences. Participants were 200 female and 173 male senior high school students aged 16 to 20 years (mean 16.7) who volunteered to take part in the study.

Students were asked about unwanted kissing, hugging, French kissing, genital contact (‚Äò‚Äòbeing felt up‚Äô‚Äô), and sex. Overall, 130 female students (76.9%) and 91 male students (67.4%) reported they had experienced one or more incidents of unwanted sexual activity. Similar numbers of male and female students reported most types of nonconsensual sexual activity; the exception was being felt up, which significantly more female than male students reported.

Students were given a list of 11 possible reasons for engaging in unwanted sex. Overall, perceived reasons for sexual coercion were similar for boys and girls. A substantial number of students reported having unwanted sex to show that they loved their partner (44.2% males, 34.7% females) or because they thought it was what the partners wanted (36.9% females, 35.6% males). Alcohol was also commonly reported as a reason for unwanted sexual activity. More than a quarter of each group (29.8% of males, and 26.9% of females) reported alcohol or drug use to be a main reason for the unwanted sexual activity. Significantly more male students reported having unwanted sexual activity because they thought their friends were doing it (21% males, 10.1% females). Relatively few students, male or female, reported fear of losing a partner, being held down (forced), being threatened with harm, or being hassled as reasons for unwanted sexual activity. Notably, almost as many males as females reported being held down and forced to have sex.

[National Baseline Study on Violence against Children: Philippines](https://www.unicef.org/philippines/reports/national-baseline-study-violence-against-children-philippines)

This study was the first ever national study on violence against children in the Philippines. Overall, 3,866 children and youth aged 13-24 years from 172 barangays in 17 regions of the country, participated in this survey. Among them, 1,979 were males and 1,887 were females.

The researchers sexual violence as ‚Äútaking photos or sex videos of being naked or engaging in sexual activities, unwanted touch, forced attempted sex, and forced consummated sex.‚Äù The first two include someone forcing the child to make the pictures or videos as well as the child doing it himself. 24.7 percent of males, compared with 18.2 percent of females, reported experiencing sexual violence.

About 3.2 percent of children and youth experienced the most severe form of sexual violence - forced consummated sex (anal, oral, and/or vaginal) during childhood. The prevalence for males was 4.1 percent, significantly higher than the 2.3 percent among females who experienced forced consummated sex.

[Sexual behavior and experience of sexual coercion among secondary school students in three states in North Eastern Nigeria](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-6-310)

This is a 2006 study exploring the reproductive health knowledge, sexual behavior and experience of sexual coercion among secondary school students in North Eastern states of Nigeria. Face-to-face interviews were conducted for 624 consenting students who were randomly selected from eighteen secondary schools using an 83-item structured questionnaire. Data was collected on demographic profile, reproductive health knowledge, sexual behavior and experience of sexual coercion. Behaviorally specific questions were used on coercion.

They asked respondents whether any of the following ever happened to them: whether ""someone touched your body against your will"", ""someone tricked you in order to have sex with you"", someone tried to force you to have sex"", ""someone forced you to have sex"", ""someone beat you for refusing to have sex with him/her"" ""someone gave you drugs in order to have sex with you"".

They found that more males than females reported being victims of sexual coercion. Table 5 shows the proportion of students who had experienced sexual coercion by gender.

||Male|Female|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Report any form of coercion|120 (37%)|104 (35%)|224 (36%)|
|Unwanted touch body|100 (31%)|93 (31%)|193 (31%)|
|Someone tried to force you to have sex|39 (12%)|30 (10%)|69 (11%)|

[Sexual Aggression among Brazilian College Students: Prevalence of Victimization and Perpetration in Men and Women](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232227972_Sexual_Aggression_among_Brazilian_College_Students_Prevalence_of_Victimization_and_Perpetration_in_Men_and_Women)

This research measured the prevalence of sexual aggression and victimization since age 14 among 742 first-year college students in Brazil (411 women). A Portuguese version of the Short Form of the Sexual Experiences Survey was administered to collect information from men and women as both victims and perpetrators of sexual aggression.

""Reports for the past 12 months and the period from age 14 up to 12 months ago were combined to yield an index of prevalence since age 14. The combined prevalence rate of victimization for the two time windows (past 12 months; since age 14 up to the past 12 months) was 27% among men and 29% among women across all aggressive strategies and sexual acts. In the total sample, verbal pressure was the most frequently reported aggressive strategy (19.3%), followed by exploitation of the victim‚Äôs inability to offer resistance (13.6%), and the threat or use of physical force (4.9%). Comparing men and women, the prevalence rates were, respectively, 16.4% and 22% for verbal coercion, 15.8% and 12% for exploitation of the victim‚Äôs incapacitated state, and 4.6% and 5.1% for threat or use of physical force. None of these rates differed significantly by gender.""

To obtain a nonredundant index of each participant‚Äôs victimisation and perpetration status, respondents were classified according to the most severe form of sexual victimisation they reported, using a scoring procedure proposed by Koss and colleagues:

1: Sexual contact (without penetration) through the use of verbal pressure, exploitation of victim‚Äôs intoxicated state, threat or use of physical force, but no attempted sexual coercion, sexual coercion, attempted rape, or completed rape.

2: Attempted sexual coercion, that is, attempted oral, vaginal, or anal penetration using verbal pressure, but no sexual coercion, attempted rape, or completed rape.

3: Sexual coercion, that is, completed oral, vaginal, or anal penetration using verbal pressure, but no attempted rape or completed rape.

4: Attempted rape, that is, attempted oral, vaginal, or anal penetration through exploitation of victim‚Äôs intoxicated state or threat or use of physical force, but no completed rape.

5: Completed rape, that is, completed oral, vaginal, or anal penetration through exploitation of victim‚Äôs intoxicated state or threat or use of physical force.

Because men had significantly more sexual partners than did women, this variable needed to be controlled to avoid a confound between gender and sexual activity. While they found that nonredundant victimisation rates were significantly higher among women for sexual coercion and attempted sexual coercion, even when controlling for number of partners, no significant gender differences were found for sexual contact and for the more severe forms of attempted rape and rape. 2.9% of women and 1.5% of men experienced attempted rape, and 5.1% of women and 5.8% of men experienced completed rape.

Among those men who reported at least one episode of victimization, 65% answered the item about sex of perpetrator. Of those, 72% were victimized only by women, 16% only by men, and 12% by both men and women. Among the female victims, 67% indicated the sex of the perpetrator. Of those, 96.3% were assaulted only by men, 1.2% only by women, and 2.5% by both sexes.

However, this study found a larger gender gap in perpetration, with far more males having reported perpetration than females.

[Experience of sexual coercion and risky sexual behavior among Ugandan university students](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-11-527)

In 2005, 980 (80%) out of a total of 1,220 students enrolled in Mbarara University of Science and Technology in Uganda participated in a self-administered questionnaire covering socio-demographic and religious factors, social capital, mental health, alcohol use, and sexual behaviour.

Experience of sexual coercion was based on a response of ""yes"" to any of the following questions: ""You have been *forced* to show your sexual organ"", ""Someone has *forced* you to let them touch your sexual organ"", ""Someone *forced* you to let them suck or lick your sexual organ"", ""Someone has *forced* you to let them show you their own sexual organ"", ""You have been *forced* to watch someone masturbate"", ""You have been *forced* to masturbate someone"", ""You have been *forced* to take part in oral sex or to lick someone's sexual organ"", ""You have been *forced* to take part in sexual intercourse with the penis in the vagina, or someone has inserted an object into your vagina"", or ""You have been *forced* to pose for a sex photo or sex film"". In the absence of any affirmative answer to the above questions, and with an affirmative answer to the question ""You have not been *forced* into any of these"", the individual was classified as unexposed to sexual coercion.

The reported prevalence was very similar between the sexes: 33.1% for females and 29.9% for males.

""Occurrence of male child rape \[in South Africa:\] Weighted by province and urban/rural areas, 9% (based on 13915/127097) reported forced sex without consent in the last year. In answer to a separate question, 44% of 18 year-olds said they had ""ever"" been forced to have sex (weighted value of 5385/11450).""

""In response to the question about the sex of the perpetrator, 32% of those who answered (7755/23889) said the perpetrator was male, 41% (weighted value for 9879/23889) said she was female and 26% (6255/23889) said they had been forced to have sex by both male and female perpetrators. Male abuse of schoolboys was much more common in rural areas while female perpetration was more an urban phenomenon.""

""Male schoolchildren in South Africa suffer high rates of sexual abuse, many of the assaults perpetrated in school. By the age of 18 years, two in every five schoolboys reported being forced to have sex, mostly by female perpetrators.""

""This study was a cross-section of children present at sample schools during a single field visit. The anonymous, facilitated self-administered questionnaire prevented registering class members not present at the time of the visit, and no effort was made to contact those who were not present as this would make them identifiable as individuals. It seems reasonable to assume that, if anything, the survey underestimated sexual violence among schoolboys.""

**Commercial sexual exploitation of boys**

[The Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in New York City](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/225082.pdf)

This is a study conducted by John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan on youths working as prostitutes in NYC. When the researchers put out a call for commercially sexually exploited children (CSEC), they ended up with far more boys than they expected. The boys ended up outnumbering the girls to such a degree that the researchers stopped accepting boys and tried to gather more girls who were being pimped.

Yet despite this effort, the researchers still found that almost half of the victims of CSEC were boys. Of the 249 children they included in the study, 119 were girls, 111 were boys, and 19 were transgender. Those results debunk the idea that only or mostly girls are prostitutes.

The researchers reported their own surprise at the large number of boys who showed up to be interviewed for their ‚Äúself-reporting‚Äù study, which was not looking for gender differences. Even though boys had been previously mentioned by some policy makers, practitioners and researchers, this study did not focus on them as a significant segment of the market or on their unique sets of problems. The report said: ‚ÄúWhile we might argue about the relative proportion of boys versus girls in the sex market, there can be little doubt that boys are far more numerous‚Ä¶than is commonly acknowledged. Policy makers and practitioners who are concerned about the growth of CSEC markets need to account for and respond to all of the youth that are swept into it, yet there is scant discussion about boys, and no services for them at all.""

[Sexual Assault, Overweight, and Suicide Attempts in U.S. Adolescents](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sltb.12148)

The study analyzed data from a Youth and Risk Behavior Survey that sampled more than 31,000 teenagers in 2009 and 2011. The research continued a preliminary study from 2011 that found similar results using a smaller sample of teens. The poll surveyed students ages 14 to 18 and examined whether the two variables influenced suicide attempts within a year of the survey.

What they found was that 3.5 percent of healthy-weight males with no sexual assault history attempted suicide. That percentage climbed to 33.2 percent for healthy-weight males with sexual assault history, which Anderson attributes to stigma, shame, possible gender role conflict if the attacker was male and the lack of an open support system. Weight alone was not a significant factor in suicide attempts for males. Only 3.9 percent of overweight males with no sexual assault history attempted suicide. For males who were both overweight and had a history of sexual assault, the percentage who attempted suicide was 33 percent.

In contrast, 5.8 percent of healthy-weight females with no sexual assault history attempted suicide. The percentage rose to 27.1 percent for healthy-weight girls with a history of sexual assault. Weight influenced the suicide rate among women: 8.2 percent of overweight girls with no sexual assault history attempt suicide. However, both factors did not increase suicide rate: 26.6 percent of overweight girls with sexual assault histories attempted suicide.

**Men are less likely to view to acknowledge their experiences of sexual assault and are less likely to report it, which likely affects data and statistics on the topic.**

""Across the United Kingdom (UK) there has been a steady increase in the number of males who feel confident enough to report their experiences to the police. However, research conducted by SurvivorsUK has suggested that the percentage of men who actually report their experiences is as low as 3.9 per cent.""

""In 2013 a joint piece of work by the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Office for National Statistics suggested that around 20 per cent of victims don‚Äôt report incidents of sexual assault and rape to the police. However, these estimates were developed using data on reporting habits collected only from women. This does though show that there is a clear acknowledgement that a large number of victims decide never to inform the police of their experiences.""

""Figures collected from all the UK‚Äôs police forces show that between 2010 and 2014 there were 26,483 recorded incidents of males being victims of sexual assault or rape. This includes 3,748 incidents recorded by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) ‚Äì the highest rate in the UK.""

""Using these figures alongside the research conducted by SurvivorsUK, we can estimate the number of males over the age of 16 who were sexually assaulted or raped between 2010 and 2014, who did not report their experiences to the police.""

""These numbers suggest that across the entire UK between 2010 and 2014, 679,051 sexual assaults and rapes of males took place. Of these ‚Äì 652,568 were not reported to any police force.""

""In the geographical area covered by the MPS this would equate to 96,103 sexual assaults and rapes of males between 2010 and 2014 ‚Äì with 92,355 of them not being reported.""

[Police Perceptions of Rape as Function of Victim Gender and Sexuality](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1350/pojo.2009.82.1.466)

In this study one hundred and twenty-eight United Kingdom police workers of various ranks read a hypothetical rape scenario in which victim gender and victim sexuality were experimentally manipulated before completing a 12-item rape attributions questionnaire focusing on perceptions of victim blame and assault severity. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) were then performed. Overall, police workers were largely pro-victim although, as expected, they were more negative towards male victims than female victims. Contrary to expectations, these trends existed regardless of victim sexuality.

How many braincels do these people have?,"Feminists will treat men like some sort of priviledged group that has hegemony over literally anything else, and proceed to blame their entire problems on the ""Patriarchy"", an unknown entity that forces women to be more oppresed than the Armenians in 1916. 

However, they are quick to blame this mysterious force for all of men's problems (Look at r/FragileMaleRedditor, for example, and look for when they can't disscuss something and start summoning this force as the culprit) even though the word itself says this is impossible.

For starters ""patriarchy"" comes from the words Patria and Archy, the first meaning ""Fatherland"" in this case used simply as ""Father"", and the second means ""To rule"". Basically, you could say ""Patriarchy"" means ""Father to rule"" thus implying ""Fathers"" or in this case men in general have a total  paramountcy hover society.

And so, how the sacred fuck does this hypotetical force manage to turn on it's conjurers and somehow cause them to be called gay for wearing a little bit of pink in their shirts? How and why does this esse somehow and magically make men way more likely to kill themselves, if it in theory just makes men live like kings?

Arguing with a coffee shop feminist on reddit with no power and likely no even real yniderstanding of feminism is"" HIGH effort, LOW yield result"" work.... a 10 minute letter to a company, organisation, school or whatever maybe correcting a journalist on false stats etc is low/moderate effort higher yield... also the positive effect you get when you send a letter and get a reply (and you usually do get a good reply, dont listen to negativity here) reinforces you to do it again.... then post your letter here, which encourages others... see 10x better use of your time than debating Brenda the coffee shop feminist on reddit. I admit I post a lot, but im doing it on breaks and I do enjoy it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also remember when you debate, you are debating for the audience NOT the radical (who is unlikely to change their mind).... thats why be polite, dont lose it, and it doesnt matter if they dont agree, you are arguing for the moderates who will see your argument laid out..... this how people are red pilled

But as I said, dont waste your time doing it, no point!!

# Here Is The Copy and Paste Post: 

Of course women have MANY issues in healthcare and many cases of being let down. As do men. The narrative of \*specifically\* female ""oppression"" or ""systemic neglect"" in way not experienced by others however is a false narrative\*\* Again no one is saying there aren''t issues but the overriding narrative is false. What causes this flawed view? See the last link in this post for why. But first:

**Women not treated as seriously by drs?**

Again huge feminsit talking point and myth:

&gt;Emily Dwass‚Äô opinion piece repeats the charge that female patients‚Äô complaints are ignored by doctors because of their gender.Her impression is not supported by research into this issue. A large nationwide review, which examined 46,868 office visits, revealed that the care received by men and women was similar about two-thirds of the time. When the care was different, women overall received more diagnostic tests and treatment ‚Äî more lab tests, blood-pressure checks, drug prescriptions, and return appointments.In the United States, we spend twice as much on the healthcare of women than on that of men. Even if you exclude obstetrical care, females at every age receive more medical attention than males. The charge that the healthcare of women is neglected because of their gender needs to be evaluated in that context.*Andrew G. Kadar, M.D., Beverly Hills*

"Most participants thought the term toxic masculinity insulting, probably harmful to boys, and unlikely to help men's behaviour. Most participants said they would be unhappy if their masculinity or femininity were blamed for their work or relationship problems.",,24,0
"According to the The Palgrave Handbook of Male Psychology and Mental Health , the word toxic masculinity has no clinical value and is an example of another cognitive distortion called negative labelling usually have a negative impact such as alienation of affected groups."," 

Plus most men percieve it as something offensive. Although 'semantically' its correct, it is not helpful. Even the word 'negro' was used to refer to black african people but ultimately became offensive.

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341832524\_Reactions\_to\_contemporary\_narratives\_about\_masculinity\_A\_pilot\_study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341832524_Reactions_to_contemporary_narratives_about_masculinity_A_pilot_study)

This study did a survey in which about 80% men found the word toxic masculinity as not helpful.

Why should we use a word which is not seen as helpful and seen as offensive? It feels like its okay to be sexist against men. Another example is of the word 'retarded' which semantally was a normal word but got banned.

'Since the word has become commonly used in informal speech, it is harder to see the connection between the original word meaning and the current informal use of the word. For this reason, it may be difficult to understand why the word is still considered offensive. The definition of the word retarded, according to Merriam-Webster dictionary is ‚ÄúOffensive: slow or limited in intellectual or emotional development‚Äù. At one point in time ‚Äúmental retardation‚Äù was a medical term used to describe a person with an intellectual disability. However, since then the word has been replaced by the term ‚Äúintellectual disability‚Äù because it is more accurate and accepting. The r-word is an exclusive term that furthers negative stereotypes about people with disabilities. It can be hurtful whether it is directed towards a person with a disability or when used as a synonym for ‚Äúdumb‚Äù or ‚Äústupid‚Äù. When used in this way it is equivalent to saying people with disabilities are stupid. In addition, the real message of the sentence is lost because the r-word has a completely different meaning than the words ‚Äústupid‚Äù or ‚Äúdumb‚Äù. There are many other words to choose from instead of the r-word that will better represent the intended meaning.'",1,0
Is this sub about hating women or just the unfair advantages extreme feminism has introduced into modern society?,"It‚Äôs pretty fair to say that for most of history, patriarchal values have placed women as second rate within most societies. Traditional gender roles, women not able to own property, right to vote, wage gaps. I know a lot of those things no longer apply in modern times but other forms of discrimination and disadvantages exist for women (victim shaming, abortion/birth control rights, wage gap still, sexual assault/harassment). Yes I know that men are also subject to many of these things but that does not diminish what women face, and vice versa. None of it is fair for anyone, and one side facing any obstacles does not make it justifiable or less significant for the other. My point being that women are fighting for change to balance the scales that have been against them for so long. My question is if this sub has become a place to attempt to keep women in their place and upholding one unfair status quo by labeling feminist activism as the opposite end of the spectrum. So are you all here advocating for equal fairness, or not? 

Browsing through this sub, I see some posts and perspectives that I can agree with. I don‚Äôt personally think women should be given the upper hand and advantage in all facets of society over men. I can agree that extreme feminism has mutated into something just as bad, just for their side/benefit and to me that is wrong. Society should be equally balanced end story. What troubles me about this sub are the posts that have become so inflamed at the idea of a woman even coming close to equal status of a man that it‚Äôs not a matter of equality but the evil workings of extreme, unreasonable feminism at play.",8,0

My opinions on feminism/men‚Äôs rights etc;,"(This post is just me ranting or gathering my thoughts tbh)

In regards to the men‚Äôs rights movement, I believe that too many members of r/mensrights are anti-women and this makes them just as bad as women, they are like the reverse of feminism, ‚Äòequal but opposite‚Äô is the best way to describe it. They hunt for any reason to attack feminism or more dangerously women as a whole

However, in regards to feminism, I believe that feminists live in ignorance. Oblivious to the fact that men can be oppressed too. Their idea is that all oppression against men can be ‚Äòdebunked‚Äô by the fact that women were oppressed much more so than men in previous generations. This idea stays with feminsm today, that women are still ‚Äòmore oppressed‚Äô than men.
This myth can very easily be debunked too though, it is the idea that one oppression cancels out another. If someone tells you that it‚Äôs impossible to be sexist to men, ask them
‚ÄúWere Jews oppressed when nazi Germany killed them in their millions simply for their religion?‚Äù
The answer will most likely be yes
‚ÄúBut what about the Jews in Israel who are persecuting the Palestinians for being Muslim? Who is oppressed there?‚Äù
‚ÄúBut what about the Muslims in Saudi Arabia who are persecuting African migrants in ‚Äòcovid detention centres?‚Äô
(This should dispel any beliefs of one oppression cancelling another out, relying on the fact that the person has listened and is not in the process of tweeting about you right now)
Although risky, this is the best analogy I can think of

"Biologically engrained, I found the answer","A little long but easy to follow.

Women like men who can protect them (or have traits of that), and want to mate them. 
They have the best chance of survival with the more powerful males.

Men want to mate with the best partner they can find for the best chance at surviving their offspring, so they do whatever the partners find most valuable which is being strong, protective, and risk dying for them. 

This is engrained biologically, because biologically we want to reproduce as a species or any species for that matter. Otherwise they would cease to exist and humans are quite successful as a species.

Therefore:
Men are more powerful (thus leaders), they protect more (thus risk their lives for their mate/children), etc.

Men are engrained to protect the women, because they think it will bring sex to pass offspring.

But women as a whole don't biologically (subconsciously) care about ""protection"" by supporting feminism, they subconsciously want the man that will best give them the best chance of survival, a man with powerful features.

And when women cannot find a partner that can give them this protection, they rely on the collective whole to protect them, hence feminism.

Fear is pushed, and any men that don't like feminism, don't want to protect women. 
There is a collective ""need"" for feminism to pass on children.

Incels offer no biological reasoning to mate for offspring and there is no collective reasons for the survival of the species.
They are hated the worst.

Male feminists offer a collective need to keep them, but no biological desire in a woman's eyes.
They are friends but not mates for offspring.

Men who go off dying or risking their lives for their partner and family that they have, dont care as much about feminism.

Women who have a partner willing to die for them, or partner with power, care about feminism to an extent, their partner can't protect them 24/7. 

Women who deeply care about feminism, fight it so hard because they know they won't be able to find a partner to protect them, they require the collective whole (feminism) to protect them.",1,0

On Gratitude,"From time to time we get posts from people who are desperately depressed because of the seeming impossibility of getting a fair deal for men, because they have been divorce raped, because they have been falsely accused or for some other reason.


Of all the spiritual practices which might help the one with the highest reward/effort ratio is probably the practice of gratitude.


It is a simple practice to get into the habit of, and there are many ways to do it. In days gone by, people used to express gratitude for food before eating, but this has fallen by the wayside along with belief in God. Nonetheless, taking time to appreciate things is a worthwhile activity.


You can do it by deliberately thinking of something or several things to be grateful for at the end of the day. For a while our family kept a jar of notes that we would add to each time there was something special worth remembering. From time to time we would open it and read them. This had the added bonus of reminding us to do things we had enjoyed before.


As a trainer on a back to work scheme, I used to get the group to come up with something at the beginning of each day. While I couldn‚Äôt measure it, I am sure that this made the whole programme much more positive. (These courses tend to be a bit negative since the participants are compelled to attend on pain of losing their benefits.)


What I also found was that many of them could not come up with anything, although I could fire of half a dozen things for them (living in Australia, being in good health, free Internet in the library, benefits while not working,  etc.) After a while, most people got the hang of it and started recognizing the good things in their lives without taking them for granted.

It is an easy habit to get into and one which, if practiced habitually will tend to guard against depression and increase happiness. It being New Year's now might be a good time to start this habit.

Edit: while on the subject of New Year's resolutions, if you resolve to give up smoking, people will come up to you at five past midnight and casually offer you a cigarette. So every year, I resolve to give up oral intercourse. This may not work for everyone.

Bothered by how normalized male circumcision is AKA genital mutilation,"I've never realized how normalized male circumcision is which is just another form of genital mutilation. FYI I'm circumcised but not for the reason you may think and it was medically necessary in fact I'm pretty sure I'm the only male in the family that is circumcised lol. Back to the topic however I am just starting to realizing how normalized even glorified male circumcision is. Something that is permanent and essentially conformed on infants without consent. 

I know this is a shitty example but I was scrolling through the hub today and saw this comment here it is word for word, "" **Wow girl you are lucky... Your man is circumcised so tight the remaining skin on his shaft cant even be pulled up into the same zip code as the base of his glans. Does it turn you on to know that your mans cock was permanently altered to the extreme, the head of his dick removed from its protective sheath and significantly desensitized by 24/7 exposure to friction all for your enjoyment. And the icing on the cake his frenulum, the male g spot, 100% carved out. I bet he can fuck for hours**."" I know that this is a shitty example but reading this just made me sick to my stomach and it the very first time I viewed a circumcised cock in disgust in fact I've lost my appetite just by reading this. I have a link but I don't want to post it unless you guys actually want me to prove it and it's not a gore video btw. This is just one of many different ways I've seen how circumcision is normalized but even glorified. 

Even though I'm circumcised I never really thought of it much and I never really viewed it as necessary but after reading this comment it only reaffirmed it more. If I do have a son in the future I will make sure that he does not get circumcised unless it is actually medically necessary but even then I will try to find potential alternatives if possible. I know that this is a dumb comment from a random video on a porn website but it shows just how menial it seems to many people in society. I know many women as well as men that support this practice and it's just disheartening. The good news is that circumcision rates are declining in the U.S and many parts of the world(except in certain areas due to culture/religion) but the way circumcision is brushed over makes me quite sad and angry.",19,0
Road of Bones: A hidden gendercide,"[A road in Siberia](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/11/16/russian-town-dusts-highway-with-human-bones-a72055) , known as the [road of death](https://archive.org/details/KolymaUncut), that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives of prisoners to build. I suspect they were totally or primarily male deaths. Anyone know any gender information on this?

&amp;#x200B;

I've found a couple of quotes more generally that might imply males in heavier work, and I'm aware some females were sent to forestry and mining.  

""As a rule, men were separated from their families and sent to do hard labor. Women, children, and the elderly were left without means for survival. Terrible conditions, hunger, and hard labor caused high mortality, particularly among children."" (Khlevniuk 2004)

""Perhaps because of the camp commanders‚Äô objections, the numbers of women who were actually sent to camps always remained relatively low (as did the number of women executed during the 1937‚Äì38 purge). According to the official statistics, for example, only about 13 percent of Gulag prisoners in the year 1942 were women. This went up to 30 percent in 1945, due in part to the enormous number of male prisoners drafted and sent to the front, and also to the laws forbidding workers to leave their factory‚Äîlaws which led to the arrest of many young women.8 In 1948 it was 22 percent, falling again to 17 percent in 1951 and 1952.9 Still, even these numbers fail to reflect the true situation, as women were far more likely to be assigned to serve their sentences in the light-regime ‚Äúcolonies.‚Äù In the large, industrial camps of the far north, they were even fewer, their presence even rarer.""

Youtube: Misandry at the UN and WHO - Regarding Men: and the UN's World Toilet Day,"Yesterday someone posted a link to this video...

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5tZyiQeNzw
* **Misandry at the UN and WHO - Regarding Men**

It's well worth the watch. For some reason the OP deleted the post.

In it we have a guest speaker, James Nuzzo posting evidence of how the UN is sexist against men. In one segment he lists the special days recognized by the UN, and one them was *International Women's Day*. Warren Farrel mentions *International Men's Day* (neither created by or recognized by the UN) and James Nuzzo mentions that the UN does recognize something on Nov 19 (IMD), and that's *World Toilet Day*. Warren Farrel mentioned that he once tried to look up whether they came up with *World Toilet Day* after IMD was created, as an insult to IMD. So I decided to look it up.

When was IMD started?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Men%27s_Day

* **History**

* **Inaugurated in 1992 on 7 February** by Thomas Oaster,[4] the project of International Men's Day was conceived one year earlier on 8 February 1991.[5] The project was re-initialised in 1999 in Trinidad and Tobago.[6] The longest running celebration of International Men's Day is Malta, where events have occurred since 7 February 1994.[7] Now as Malta was the only country that observed the February date of celebrating Men and their contribution to the society, the Maltese AMR Committee voted in 2009 to shift the date for IMD to 19th November.[8]

* Jerome Teelucksingh, who revived the event, chose 19 November to honour his father's birthday and also to celebrate how on that date in 1989 Trinidad and Tobago's football team had united the country with their endeavours to qualify for the World Cup.[9][10] Teelucksingh has promoted International Men's Day as not just a gendered day but a day where all issues affecting men and boys can be addressed. He has said of IMD and its grass roots activists, ""They are striving for gender equality and patiently attempt to remove the negative images and the stigma associated with men in our society"".[11] 

When did the UN come up with *World Toilet Day*?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Toilet_Day

* Observed by:	worldwide
* Date:	19 November
* Frequency:	annual
* First time:	19 November 2001 (unofficially) and 19 November 2012 (as an official UN Day)
* Related to:	UN-Water (convener), World Toilet Organization (initiator)

So the UN came up with WTD in 2001, 9 years after WMD was inaugurated.

I think that spells out pretty clearly what the UN thinks of WMD.

The Wikipedia article lists why WTD is so important.

* Toilets are important because access to a safe functioning toilet has a positive impact on public health, human dignity, and personal safety, **especially for women**.",8,0

Child Support/Alienation advice,"So without diving too deep and personal and disclosing the novel which is my life story ..I'm gunna  try to keep it simple.

I have been alienated from my children for almost 10yrs now. I've done the best I could to keep going and move on with my life with the hope that one day it will be made right. I've suffered so much over the years. Not just from crippling depression and trauma from being helplessly ripped out of my children's life, but also financial ruin. Child support has made it impossible for me to get anywhere in life. I've been homeless multiple times because of it...Lost jobs because of it... vehicles...my license...even been jailed for falling behind.

I just found out through a friend, who did some social media snooping for me, that my ex (the baby momma) has just bought a house. A nice one too. It's big, 3 car garage, large in-ground pool, 2 kitchens, nice suburban neighborhood, you get the point. 

Obviously my ex has come into a large amount of money. From what I have been able to see on casenet, she been battling in civil court for the past several years. But I can't find out the outcome or details because it doesn't disclose that info, plus apparently it was sent to federal court. But my hypothesis is she won a large settlement.

Meanwhile here I am...poor af, living in squallor, well below poverty level. They garnish at least 60% of my pay. Tax returns, stimulus check, all intercepted. I am constantly facing eviction and utility shut offs because I just can't make enough to survive, much less get ahead or save up. I walk over a mile to work in rain, snow, cold, and heat because they suspended my license, not that I can afford to even own a car anyway. Every day is a struggle...and there's no end in sight. I try very hard to stay strong, to be humble and thankful. Some days are better than others obviously, but overall I been pretty good about not letting things get to me so much and making the best of what I have.

I'm not even jealous. Obviously, like it would be to anyone else, it is kinda a blow to the gut. Feels completely unfair. But life is not fair. But honestly, I am glad to know that my kids are well provided for and getting to live the good life. 

So what I am wondering is whether this could affect the child support amount? I can't afford to even get on my feet, and she just bought a huge house (well over $500k). All I have wanted and been trying to do is build a life, one that is stable, one that I could have my kids in again. But I struggle to just keep my electric on and food in the fridge.

 Is there something I should do? Or can do even? Is it even worth it? I can't afford a lawyer. But anyone out there got any advice or suggestions? Thank you for reading.",7,0
We need to make our 36th birthdays a cause for celebration. (to raise awareness),"In the US the maximum age of conscription is 35. This means that when you turn 36 you are home free from being sent to foreign lands to get your guts blown out. I feel like bringing attention (by celebration) to this important milestone could raise some awareness of how fucked up the whole thing is. 

I'm in Canada and here it is 45 years old. I'm 6 months away from having this potential burden lifted from my mind. I was 7 years old when on remembrance day my mother told me about how awful war was. My first question was ""Why would any man choose to go to war?"" Her response was that they have no choice because they are conscripted by force. She also told me that most/many generations of young men had been made to go through this and there was a chance this could apply to me when I was grown up.  I said I would refuse. She informed me of the consequences to which I replied ""I will hide"". I can't remember how the rest of the convo went but I remember being scared (I was 7 and yes it was borderline abuse on her part to tell me these things at that age but my mom was a straight shooter). Throughout my life any time a conflict would start arising I remember thinking ""Is this the one?"" 

This age milestone is important and needs to be made into a big deal. IMO",21,0

To the young men here: develop a strong frame,"I'm seeing a lot of sentiment on this sub lately that reads like this: ""I feel hated for being a man, I feel lesser for being a man, I feel sub-human for any reason whatsoever"" 

I wanted to take a moment and address this type of thinking for all you young and impressionable guys on this sub. 

Firstly this is a mental health issue, not a men's right's issue. YOUR personal worldview is YOUR responsibility. 

- Internet algorithms are going to feed you crap that triggers you or keeps your eyeballs on the page, NOT the truth

- What you hear on the news or on reddit is typically extremism

- No one is going to hold your hand and remind you of the above, so begin to practice healthy skepticism of everything you read on reddit

I advocate all men here, especially young men, to become aware and cultivate your frame.

Do you live in a warm, friendly universe? A place where strangers are rooting for your success? 

Or do you live in a dark place where all women and the media and public and reddit are all rooting for your demise, simply because you are a man?

Decide what you think the truth is, question it to see if it holds up from different angles, and then stick to it despite what headlines tell you.

For example, ""kill all men"" and the idea that women hate men is toxic. We can debate whether 20% of women believe this or 80% do. So what about the other group? That group of silent women you never read about, who sympathetically understand the struggle of men and want us to have equal rights? You don't see them because you don't look for them, because our mind sees only what we look for.

Your frame is a *choice*. Either your subconscious runs it (99% of men) or you take charge and decide what it is (1% of men).

Take charge and start focusing on the various groups of women and men out there who want you to succeed, and FEEL EMPOWERED to tackle the struggles that we face as men.",12,0

I feel like people hate me for being born male,"I just wanted to get this out. It's not going to be well written.

Just everywhere I go men are shamed. Faggot, virgin, loser, coomer, beta, cuck, small dick, gay, etc. Even among conservative women they go on about how there are so few real men anymore. 

I don't know how to act around women. There is like a million different influences. The older generation says I should be a ""gentleman"". MRA's say I should be *masculine*. Feminists want me to be *feminine*. I'm scared to be myself 

My very existence is problematic apparently. I don't feel like I have a place here. My views are also considered radical and dangerous.

I see schools implementing routines to teach young boys not to be rapists. I genuinely wonder how long it'll be until they start neutering us at birth or something because I'm a disease. 

Any man who expresses disapproval of this stuff in academia is being fired. I keep trying to actually talk to feminists but they aren't receptive to my concerns

"""Women Needed a Magazine that Doesn‚Äôt Lie to Them. So I Started One"" - Anti feminist magazine for women anti man bashing etc.","Article about it:

[https://quillette.com/2019/02/20/women-needed-a-magazine-that-doesnt-lie-to-them-so-i-started-one/](https://quillette.com/2019/02/20/women-needed-a-magazine-that-doesnt-lie-to-them-so-i-started-one/)

The magazine is here:

[https://www.eviemagazine.com/](https://www.eviemagazine.com/)

On search bar search men, masculinity, feminism etc. Some very good anti feminist articles. 

Basically it's anti feminist online magazine for women about beauty and womens stuff mainly. Great anti feminist and pro masculine articles and goes very very much against man bashing and anti male feminists rhetoric currently. Obouvlsy its a magazine so will have some articles you agree and some you don't, and some that are very middle feminsit (well not really, feminists wouldnt like the articles). My point is that its a step in right direction, as anti feminist, pro masculine stuff is more mainstream, making it reach another audience....here women.  those women reading the magazine would never read MRA content, so by seeing this at least they can see some anti-feminist narrative content and would otherwise normally see loads of feminist content men bad bull shit

Some people worry about this kind or approach by women as they see it as trad con stuff... most articles on feminism and masculinity I dont think are in that category. Maybe a few here and there are. Personally I am not too bothered by tradcon stuff too, we have mutual interests.",12,0
"Saw a ""The Future is Female"" shirt today. I am really amazed anyone considers this equality as oppose to supremacy.","I saw someone wearing a ""The Future is Female"" today. I find it truly amazing we can see this is as part of an equality movement, it seems rather obvious to me telling a specific group of people they have no share of the future is supremacy.

To quickly break it down, by definition, it says ""the future"", meaning there is a single future. ""is female"" means it belongs specifically to those who are female. By definition, it means it does not belong to those who are not female--meaning they think we have no share in the future.

I think it is a testament to what people will believe if it is simply repeated loudly enough with enough done to try to silence those who disagree.",13,0
Can we start using the term fake feminist for people who are out to seek anti-equality against men?,"1. There are real feminists who are fighting for real issues all over the world, they deserve the right to be acknowledged. Being anti feminism looks like you are against real feminists too. Similarly when women have to mention ""well, not all men."" I think they deserve the right considering they are being beaten and imprisoned for basic human rights.
We need to stand with women who want basic human rights. 

2. The image that is given to majority of the nation is: anti-feminism = anti-equality. Even if most US feminists are looking to get a step up, it sets a negative tone and automatically lures people away.

I prefer to call them fake feminists because the goal is not equality and it doesn't diminish the few who want equality. 

I think this will progress MRAs and their image.

Do we want to be heard? Then we need to stop making blanket statements against all feminists.

Do we want to be isolated? Then we can keep  making MRAs have a negative public image.",90,0

Question for Fathers.,"So my wife is pregnant with our first child. We decided we wanted to wait to find out the gender so we won't know till they're born. Everyone in my family and her family think it's a boy and my wife now thinks it's a boy.

So now that she's 33 weeks pregnant and the closer we're getting I've been thinking (maybe overthinking) on what I'll need to do for my child.

With everything going on, how girls and boys are addressed and treated differently in society. Am I worrying over nothing if I have a boy? Because if I do. When they're old enough I feel like I need to ensure they know it's okay to feel emotion, teach them how to protect themselves when alone with a female to ensure they're not falsely accused of something, etc.

And for people who are fathers of boys is it true that boys are essentially being told not to be rapists and abusers by teachers?

I just want to set up my child (regardless of gender) to be successful in life. But it seems harder if I had a son. If my rambling makes sense.",21,0

"This sub is making me depressive, why should I get involved into any of this?","So the feminism we have seem lately is very depressing for me, I rarely get affected by it in real life, the people I meet in person are usually ""normal"" and I don't see as much hate for men as I see on the internet. Of curse there are tons of social justice warriors at work and stuff but I can chose just not to interact with this people. 

I feel that I'm becoming a kind of feminist from the other side, in real life I don't have that many consequences but I'm getting scared of women just because of all I read online. Just like women that are worried of men because of everything, even though it is very unlikely they will get rapped or whatever. I'm scared of being falsely accused of rape, of being manipulated into impregnating someone, of being financially slaved and so on. Rationally I think this is silly, because I think that it is very unlikely to happen but I'm still irrationally scared. 

Lately I lost the interest of dating at all, it got to my mind that I'm just seen as a ""potential rapist"" and I feel like just retreating from any kind of relationship with women, I don't want to deal with this, why would I want to have anything to do with someone that is afraid of me? The times I do interact with women for dating I try to be as passive as possible to try to not show any kind of aggression, I won't disagree with anything and just support the lady in any non sense she says - this is very boring for me and it makes me lose interest very fast. And this is getting worse the more I get into this world of men x women.

That is why I'm thinking that getting into any kind of men's right activism is fucking my mind the same way feminism is fucking the minds of many women. I'm thinking just retreating myself from all of this to try to go back to normal.

What do you think about this? Don't you feel feel affected the same way? How different is mra from feminism in this aspect ?",35,0

The police lied and told him that if he turned himself in, they wouldn't take him to jail where he ended up spending a month, and now he can barley get a job anywhere. Only got this one because he's friends with the manager who kindly ignored the background test. Sure, I've learned #1 rule is NEVER TALK TO THE POLICE WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY, so if he never had said anything, who knows? Maybe he would have a clean record right now.. But anyways, it just infuriates me that he's now on the sex offender registry, spent a month in jail due to a $10k bond even after he turned himself in and cooperated with the police, and it was a non-violent crime! I got a DUI, underage consumption charge, underage possession charge, and possession of marijuana charge, and walked out with a free/no cost bail the same night. Being a DUI, I was putting not only my LIFE but others LIVES at risk driving drunk and high! Is that not worse than sending or asking for nudes?? Not long after that I was arrested for public intoxication, and resisting arrest after having to be recuffed 3 times, screaming and fighting with the police, and bashing my head into the police car repetitively, and that was only a $1k bail so I was out the next day. So our ""justice"" system is going to let violent, insane druggies/alcoholics like me back out on the streets for free, or only $1k bond, but they're going to lock a dude up for a month with a $10k bond just for asking for or sending nudes to a chick who never even mentioned her age, and was flirting with him?!

How do we get equal reproductive access for men?,"Right now women can easily reproduce asexually. Just walk into a spermbank. Or get a one night stand. Now of course getting laid is super easy for a women but a challenge for men thanks to a rigged dating dynamics. But aside from that the man has no choice on keeping the kid. People here love talking about paper abortion but let's talk about the other side. That men do not have equal reproductive access. 

I propose that abortion should be a double approve policy. If either Father or Mother oppose the kid cannot be aborted. Further, there needs to be a way so that Men can get a kid without having to go through the dating dynamics. A sperm bank but in reverse. The fact that women have 100% reproductive control is a key reason dating is rigged in favour of women. They control all the cards. Men need Women to reproduce but women do not need Men. 

As a man, I should be able to reproduce as easily as a woman could. I should also be able to marry up and be asked out and catered to the way women are but that is a different discussion. Hopefully one day Men would truly get treated equal to Women instead of being treated  as the second class humans we are right now?",23,0

The first person to be vaccinated is always a woman,"Over the past few weeks this has caught my attention  as the COVID vaccine has been rolled out in more and more countries. Truth be told, I can't say it's something I didn't see coming but to actually see it play out just as I predicted is a little surreal.

First, a little background. As a young and healthy individual, I am in no rush at this point to get the vaccine--if anything, I am somewhat reluctant. If I were an older nursing home resident, I would likely be more willing, but even then it wouldn't matter to me if I were the first person in my country, or even the first person in the home, to be vaccinated so long as I could receive the vaccine as soon as possible if that were my intent.

However, as I alluded earlier, since the beginning of December, the vaccine has been introduced in more and more countries, states, provinces, etc. The media always make a big deal of showing the first person to obtain the vaccine--and that person is always a woman. Granted, the high-risk populations being prioritized for vaccine are predominantly female--most nurses are women, and far fewer men than women survive into their 90s and 100s, but even so if the participants had been truly selected randomly, you would at least expect a minority of men as the first participants, but instead you only see women. Why is that? I think we all know the answer, and that answer is incredibly relevant to understanding our current cultural zeitgeist.

In short, health authorities and governments are deliberately ensuring that the first shot is administered to a woman to avoid ensuing the anger of feminists and their powerful allies. They know that if a woman receives the first vaccine, nobody will protest, but if the first shot were to be administered to a man, this would lead to widespread anger and condemnation from feminists who would accuse the governments of being sexist or misogynistic, and are trying to avoid this label. I can't really blame them either, given the powerful allies that the radical feminist movement has that gives it a disproportionately large platform to express its displeasure, despite constituting a fringe view and comprising a small percentage of the population. First, there's the legacy media, still highly influential even in the Internet age, 90% of which are completely devoted to radical identity politics and feminist causes, and where the left-wing media outlets are constantly racing to out-virtue signal each other as being the most ""progressive"" (i.e. feminist) media organisation. Many corporations and large businesses have turned to championing feminist causes as well, and in the general atmosphere of political correctness present in the West today, simply questioning the validity of the feminist cause can be detrimental to one's professional prospects. 

I should also add that in light of the reasoning being used to determine who is vaccinated first, there is actually a very strong argument why a man should be selected to receive the first dose. The death rate from COVID-19 across every age group has been shown to be roughly 2x higher for men as compared to women. Therefore, if an average 80-year-old woman has a 5% chance of dying upon COVID infection, the risk to a man the same age would be 10%. Given that the old and frail are among the first groups to be vaccinated *precisely because* of the elevated risk to their life and health, and the first person to be vaccinated should naturally be  among the most at-risk people who can be safely vaccinated, it would make sense that much of the time, a man should be selected. And while we are on the topic of differential death rates, can you imagine the fervor and outrage feminists would generate if the death rates were reversed, such that women were twice as likely to die as men? The moment cases got out of control, or a government were alleged to have made a mistake by not bringing in enough lockdown measures or not implementing them quickly enough, they would almost instantly accuse that government of being either intentionally or unconsciously sexist, and claim that the pandemic was not being taken seriously because more women were dying. And of course, sharing their ideology, the mainstream media would instantly jump to their support and rubber-stamp their claims as unquestionable truth.

The last thing I wanted to add is that I think this is part of a larger trend toward promoting women at all costs and marginalising men. For example, in 20 years from now, we might actually see the first manned Mars mission. It's likely that the crew will be diverse and co-ed (which I have nothing against, I should add, so long as the astronauts are selected based on merits rather than membership to a particular gender or ethnic group), and when the moment comes to decide who gets to take the first step on the Martian surface, I think it's not difficult to predict what the astronaut's gender will be, regardless of the others' credentials. To do otherwise, after all, would be to legitimize the patriarchy, seemingly eliminated, yet still relevant. And in more down-to-earth (pardon the pun) matters that may affect the average man much more acutely, companies are increasingly being pressured to enforce quotas, not only in employment as a whole, but in the upper managerial echelons of an organisation, to ensure gender equality at all costs, to shatter the pervasive ""glass ceiling"". Naturally, this will come at huge cost to men who will have to try even harder to get the position, lest they be passed over for a woman of potentially lower qualifications, but will be seen as demonstrating the company's commitment to diversity and equality and fulfilling its internal quota. All this despite the fact that study after study has shown that men are actually falling behind women with respect to post-secondary education, and that this gap is widening. Still, this doesn't fit the feminist narrative portraying women as the oppressed and men as the oppressors, so it is largely ignored. And all this is happening while working-class jobs that don't require post-secondary education are precisely the ones being automated and off-shored, leaving many men chronically unemployed with few career prospects. In other words, I don't want to state the obvious, but it's clear that it's certainly a bleak time to be a man right now.",4,0

A toast to equality,"Last night I commented on a Facebook post in a group about a TV series in which one of the characters is trying to reunite with her son, whom she had abandoned 20 years prior for her own well being and left the kid with the psychotic dad.

I mention that in my opinion the character is a bad mother; I had a similar experience when I was young, got a girl pregnant who turned out to be a complete toxic abusive demon and used every trick in the book to fuck with me but I didn't turn my back, I put up the fight of my life in court and ended up getting custody and raising my son without any help nor child support from the mom.  My son is now a grown adult but I'm still dealing with the repercussions that came after.

In comes this lady saying she walked away from her first born due to postpartum depression and mental abuse but later remarried, had two more kids but does not have contact with the first one...

My obvious response is are you serious?  How could you just leave your kid behind with an abusive father? 

Lo and behold! In comes the army of white knights defending her, calling me an asshole, saying I'm hero posturing, telling me to seek help etc. etc.

What's funny to me is, had the gender roles been reversed and I had left my kid behind, never related to him and never paid child support, I would have been labeled as a worthless deadbeat sperm donor, and here I am getting vilified for... having done the right thing?",7,0

Notice how they feel entitled, even as young teenagers, to instigate this kind of confrontation on the street. But especially, notice how quickly and easily they begin calling him a pedophile. Then they go on repeatedly shouting it out, to enlist bystanders.

""Believing all women"" is not about the tragedy of sexual abuse or sexual assault, otherwise we would also care about male victims. It is about _power_. It is about being able to walk around your neighborhood, your workplace, your home, knowing you can end male life with a word. 

Like a lot of young people, these young ladies are using power recklessly. They've been handed a gun, and now they're shooting up the neighborhood. But just replay this video, and consider what sexual abuse really is for them. Not a tragedy. Just a card to be played in a confrontation, to dominate their immigrant victim. That it might end his life (cause him to lose his job, his home, his friends and his family) and is therefore disproportionate (for a moment of bigoted harrassment) is the sort of thing that might occur to them later, when they grow up.

I was falsely accused of stalking an Older Girl. I need to Vent about my Story,"I had a small crush on a girl going into tenth grade. I was a rather naive guy at the time, always drawing up plans on when and how to talk to her, cheesy stuff. By February, I decided to land the knockout blow by sending her a Valentine Gram. Though the day she got it she approached me after school and thanked me, I later found out through a friend that she didn't feel the same way. All right, fair enough. 

I made the mistake of trying to talk to her one afternoon after school, and after some passive-aggressiveness, she told me to my face that she didn't like me. That was the last time I spoke to her.

 A month later, a friend who had known about my crush on her went to breakfast with her. She told me that my crush felt scared because I was ""stalking her"" when walking after school. Now, two things to note here. One, we both walk through the parking lot to get home from school, and two, she's almost a year older than me because I am a year ahead. Instead of blowing it up, I left it alone and avoided her. 

Another month later, and I'm being called to the office over if because ""one of her friends was concerned"". Thankfully, my counselor and the assistant principal who had been told quickly believed me and let me off the hook, but among my peers, hell reigned. The friend who had originally told me about all this betrayed me. Over the summer, most of my closest friends left me as well, except for one, believing me to be silly to be calling it a false accusation. This was in 2019, and the latter half of it was the worst part of my life. At the beginning of Junior year, I was constantly bullied, expelled by people, and recently now in my senior year had to leave my only club because many still held a grudge. Her single action ruined high school for me. 

I live in the Bay Area, a feminist hell hole, so it just hurts to see all these ""women in stem!"" ""believe women!"" and other bs when this sentiment ruined my high school life. When I see men like Johnny Depp get falsely accused, I take it personally, and it makes my blood boil. That's what I have to say, thanks for reading.",71,0

Feminism as academic discipline,"Have you ever wondered how Feminism (aka Gender Studies, aka Women‚Äôs Studies) got to be included in Universities as an academic discipline? It‚Äôs not like it has any of the analytic tools or rigor of an academic discipline ‚Äì there are no feminist academics in our universities crunching away on differential equations. No, it really is just what it seems - the same old ‚ÄúMan bad, Woman victim‚Äù cant puffed up with pseudo-intellectual verbiage. So, why is it treated as if it were a legitimate field of study?

I, for one, have wondered about this. And I was reminded of my undergrad days (in the very distant past) when my routine required regularly passing by the Department of Theology. There was this small, worn plaque outside and steps leading down from the street to a couple of dark basement offices. Quite a comedown for what was once (in the even more distant past) considered the ‚ÄúQueen of Sciences‚Äù. A bit sad even. I suspect the Biochemists next door were just waiting for the last of them to retire, so they could move in &amp; claim the space.

In this same period, across campus, the university had started their first lectures in ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Studies‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt notice this apparent coincidence at the time, but I guess you can see where I‚Äôm heading. In the past, Christianity was the dominant ideology of Western society. Now, not so much. But as it has declined, we‚Äôve seen the rise of Feminism. And - in many spaces, but not all - feminism has inherited the privileged place that Christianity used to have as the dominant ideology of the establishment.

Of course, it‚Äôs not just Feminism &amp; Christianity that have had this place. Marxist-Leninist ideology had a central place in the Soviet education system. Even today, every university in China has a school of Marxism. 

The Nazis also dressed up their ideology as ‚Äúrace science‚Äù and installed it in Universities.

Of course, this doesn‚Äôt stop in Universities. At least here in Australia, feminism is being forced on school students ‚Äì just as was done with Christianity, Communism &amp; Nazism.

PS: It is absolutely not my intent to liken Christianity to, say, Nazism. My point is only about the place of dominant ideologies in Universities. However, if there are any Nazis here who are offended about being mentioned alongside Feminism, (or even vice versa) then I really couldn‚Äôt care less.

PPS: I have, in the past, endeavoured to understand how anyone could consider Feminism an academic discipline. The most common response is a rather unsatisfying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated‚Äù. I‚Äôve also seen the circular justification that it‚Äôs embedded in universities, so it must be an academic discipline. The only argument that made any level of sense was that it has peer reviewed journals ‚Äì like a real discipline. But, if you think that makes sense, then I‚Äôd point out that there were also journals of Nazi race science starting with as Archiv f√ºr Rassen- und Gesellschaftsbiologie (Journal of Racial and Social Biology).",8,0

Victim of fraud and abuse,[removed],1,0
Accused falsely of rape earlier this year so thought I'd tell my story,"This post will be long. Thought it would be best to vent here because this seems like a good subreddit, I've been upvoting and reading posts for a bit and one just similar to this.

I should start by mentioning that I have deep respect for anyone who has dealt with a false allegation of rape. While this story was let's say not as drastic and life effecting as way too many men actually deal with that can come with false rape allegations and furthermore I was in a position where I had supportive friends that knew how deep down messed up my ex girlfriend was.

So I am a 17 year old male, high school student from New Zealand to put some perspective on me. I dated this girl starting from August of last year up until I think the end of July, I became best friends with her after her and her ex who I am now friends with once again broke up and then few months later we started dating.

In reality we ""messed around"" but never had direct sex or any type of sex at all, everyone around school knew about our relationship, everyone knew the guy I was, I'd try my hardest respect her, her boundaries and care for her in every way that I could. She went and told me the day we broke up which was online for the record that she had told her dad about how I was once suicidal but had to go and see a therapist because I didn't want that pressure mounting onto her. I what I imagine to be understandable I  got pissed off because I told her that in confidence not wanting it to get released, especially to her extremely judgmental dad and possibly even worse her mum and told me in a fat rage, that I faked being suicidal for attention (Despite not wanting to tell anyone) and that if I told her that I was suicidal ever again she'd tell me and believe I was just faking it for attention.

Get along to when we went back to school, I had a lot of friends that were real supportive, this happened in the holidays so I had already told them on the day and tension was massive around school but regardless I had my guy friends and even some girl friends. 

It was a Friday and taking a course I wasn't directly at school on a Friday and I get this message from her ex and my now friend, ""She's going around saying you touched her inappropriately and when she told you to stop you called her worthless"" to then by interval ""She's going around saying you fingered her when she wanted you to stop and all this crap"" and I am understandably freaking the fuck out, I'm about 40 minutes away by car from school doing this course and I'm basically just going on all of this crap and can not focus on my work. 

After the course finished for the day, I went into the police station and said exactly to the lady at the counter ""My ex is falsely accusing me of rape"" and they made a note to my name. 

I did not want to face the reality of telling my own mum, I did not want to go and defend my case so drastically so it looks like I'm the guilty one trying to deflect accusations so I didn't. I did tell my mum and the more people she told, the more it became blatantly obvious that she was really trying to ruin me, I do not know why but clearly it started to effect my work performance and stress and create stupidly large amounts of anxiety, talking to my families lawyer, making reports to the school where they didn't do a dam thing except have a 5 minute chat about it to her every report I made which didn't work she only tried to spread it out more.

Not many people took her side, not many people believed it and I'm so glad that I'm open about the person that I want to be because I would never want to do that. People would joke about it with me and I'd receive updates from many sources and even though I had to tell my mum, the school counsellour and my aunty who contacted the school counsellour (She herself is one) she made a real stupid mistake.

She had a 4 day relationship with another guy and went out of it and accused him of rape after it ended but thankfully for him, he was so uncomfortable by how sexually driven she was that he got his friends which ironically were the people who did believe her about the accusations about me, to hang around and called her out, to cut the story, she had to make up a very informal apology which she was forced to send by one of my friends that she tried to contact in an Instagram Group Chat to myself and her now other ex but mainly myself but it wasn't even truthful, she pinned the blame on someone else saying ""Oh well they started it and I just went along with it""

She lost a lot of friends and she only has about 3 now, I mean 3. It's not the ""Oh I only have 3 close friends."" No. She literally only has 3 friends, the only 3 people that will stay by her side through all of this just because they don't have anyone else.

"Privilege, Oppression &amp; Equality","For starters thank you for keeping this community alive, This is my first post in it.

I had a wonderful discussion with a gentleman from here, in case you wish to read it here is the link.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kkdo4d/when\_female\_privilege\_backfires\_this\_completely/gh2ikmt/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kkdo4d/when_female_privilege_backfires_this_completely/gh2ikmt/?context=3)

Without degrading its context, I believe that we need to clarify some things about the current situation with feminism and the ""equality"" that feminists wish ""to impose to patriarchy"".

Given how most of them refer to ""the oppression of patriarchy"".

Let's clarify some things about patriarchy, oppression, and equality.

Patriarchy, is a very, very specific term, according to wikipedia here its definition:

 **Patriarchy is a** [**social system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_system) **in which** [**men**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men) **hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership,** [**moral authority**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_authority)**,** [**social privilege**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_privilege) **and control of property. Some patriarchal societies are also** [**patrilineal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrilineal)**, meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.** 

**This doesn't make any sense whatsoever.**

1) The law system and the military system is full with women.

2) Moral authority: The law system is clearly supporting women to an insane level.

3) Social privilege: Check olyfans for a ""man social privilege"". LOL.

4) Control of property: Check bezos wife for control of property.

These are just examples out of the millions and millions example that we can bring to the table from everyday life to politics, finances, social justice, that irrefutably disprove all the claims of all the feminists in the world.

However, they deny all these, and remove themselves from reality. But why? Let's analyze it.

One of the reasons why there was much more harmony at the older times is that every person was coexisting in a system that was making sense, and his privileges and authority, **were based on his responsibilities and what he/she was offering to the collective.**

What feminists offer to the collective currently? Drama? Justice? Revenge against the women of 1980?

Wrong.

None of those reasons are the real ""whys"" they are behaving like they do, they ignore reality as much as they do, or they have the insanely radical beliefs they do.

The real reason is that, just like every other human, from every other country.

**They were given too much liberty and they never learnt how to appreciate it.**

**Disclaimer: I am not advocating towards imprisoning women mentally/physically/ whatever.**

The whole insanity of feminism to begin with didn't start with the actual-women rights - based organization which was the old feminism. Which did make a lot of sense, no doubt about it. 

Because to be completely fair, some men abuse their authority towards **everyone, not just group.**

So after we crossed the part of the social- equality, we jumped in the wagon of social-progressiveness.

That was the deadly mistake. And look at what happened because of it.

Gradually concepts like religion/ethics/morals were sacrificed in the shrine of progressiveness and liberty, and the narratives were mostly based on the oppressive part of the traditionalism/ patriarchy/ religion/ men-supporting society, blah blah. Bs. 

To be objective here, there was some oppression and there's no doubt that many abused their authority which ended up becoming a miscalculation in the equation of social harmony. But that doesn't justify this borderline madness in both the law system and the society that's completely biased towards women, at all.

Now about the feminists, we're using reddit which is both owned and mostly used by radical leftists, who are practically no different than extremists, however let me tell you this:

Whether feminism is right or wrong, or whether equality between the two genders is correct, or whether inequality is correct there's one thing we can confirm.

**Feminists don't care about equality at all. And everyone who supports them doesn't belief in his/her own beliefs at all**

When someone is so radicalized against a specific group of people, he's beyond saving, I very much doubt that any woman or man can reason with them any time soon.

We should forget about compromising or negotiating with them completely, and certainly not attempt to fight the system that supports them. 

And educate and distant ourselves from them as much as we can.

Daughters, wives, friends, don't increase their numbers. That's the best you can do at this point.

A man wrote on Facebook that he was a representative in a student union when he was seen speaking to a person who was wearing a hat associated with a major political candidate. Some students made up a false story about him, drove him from his position. He was ostracized and alienated, so he left the university. While he is not in the USA, I answered as if he were. Here is some information.

I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.

Please consider a Title IX complaint and discussion with a lawyer.

""Hostile Environment
Hostile Environment is defined as the following by Title IX:

""A situation of discriminatory or sexual nature that has occurred and created a adverse setting

"A long time ago, I was falsely accused of rape. I just want to vent it out.","I want to be clear that I know a lot of men who get false accusations get it a lot worse. I wasn't arrested, no jail time. All of my issues were social.

Probably about 15 years ago - I would've been somewhere between 16 and 17 in this, a female friend called me distressed and crying. She tells me her and her boyfriend decided to smoke weed, since, ""I haven't done it in a long time and he never had."" She said shortly after, he started touching her, she said she wasn't interested, and he continued. She continued that she blacked out in the trauma and came back into awareness with her panties down and not really sure how far it went. 

So - so far this doesn't sound like a false accusation does it? Well, I told her that that is serious and that she needs to talk to the police. She said she's worried they would arrest him. I tell her, ""if he raped you, yes. That's what they need to do."" She says she'll think about it. Fast forward a few weeks and I run into a mutual friend. He's pissed at me - telling me that he's gonna beat my ass. Why? Because, and I quote, ""&lt;female friend&gt; told me how you raped her!"" I did WHAT!? 

So, I find out she was worried I'd go to the cops on her behalf and started a smear campaign. For years, people judged me as a rapist. I remember one incident in particular. My, now, wife and her brother were working at the same place (before her and I got together) and people all the time were asking them why they'd want to be around me as I am a rapist. 

Here's my moral, even if Johnny Depp could tell it better than I. False accusations don't have to take place at a courthouse or on a 911 call. Any court in the world can hear them and that includes the court of public opinion.",223,0

Exposing body is the female primitive method of asking for sex ,  if they ask a women to wear decent clothing she will shout ,  so if they cant suppress their primitive method ,  then how come they shame men for not suppressing their primitive method .
The difference is that the female method is quite and secretive while the male method is loud and criminalized.

Being around exposed women is uncomfortable for men ,  so how come they tell men to avoid staring because its uncomfortable for them ,  but they have no regard for how their clothing affects them ,  especially for religious ones who don't want to be tempted by strange women.

This is some thing I got. From a red pill page. Didn't write this but found interesting.,"When I wondered with myself about the reason for masochism among men, I concluded - according to my own opinion - these facts:
- Firstly, masochism, or masochism - as the dictionary defines it - is a person who enjoys sexually the control of others over him and receiving verbal and physical insult ..
- The female is born innately by the love of the man‚Äôs control over her, especially from the sexual point of view, and this trait remains in the female no matter how feminists try to fight her and implant sadism (as opposed to masochism) in the female psyche to raise her affair in front of the man .. This explains the female‚Äôs dislike and disgust from the submissive man until If she was a tomboy and pretended to be sadism, even if it was out of love to change the routine sometimes.
- As for men, they are born out of an innate love for female control, but unfortunately that instinct has changed because of the society in which the feminine ideas spread that forced men to sanctify the female no matter what she was and whatever she did and the thing they focused on is the female body they made him naked with all kinds of adornment and Encourage her to mix with men while protecting her from his harassment, and this is so that he increases his reverence for her, especially in terms of sexuality, and thus submitting to her in order to obtain from her what he wants regardless of the cost of the matter of dignity and honor.
- The worst cases of changing men‚Äôs instinct to masochism come from families whose females are sadistic, masculine women, and the rest of the cases are affected by what they see in terms of female corruption in society or the media (whether on television or the Internet). The media after the family is the most dangerous reason that broadcasts into the minds of young people the toxins of feminine sadism through beautification. The image of the female and making her a strong heroine and demeaning the image of the man.",7,0

I have posted a few times about how patriarchy theory (as used by modern feminism since the creation of it in 1970 by Kate Millet - an absolute mad feminist according to her own sister and conspiracy theorist) is like flat earth theory (which includes the global cover up to hide the fact that the earth is flat by NASA etc). Flat earth theory and the theory that there is a global conspiracy to cover this up has amazing comebacks for why e.g. no one has found the edge of the earth etc. why private companies who have sent satellites have seen the earth being round.

So I proposed misadnry-archy to explain society, but someone said how come most USA presidents are male. FUCK. My theory ruined.... don't worry friends, misadnry-archy theory still covers this.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Misadnry-archy theory explains our entire society. In misadnry-archy theory society is shaped by the exploitation of men. Both men and women enforce this. This is due to a hatred of men (misandry) which views men only for their utility, whereas women are viewed as innately having value (this is demonstrated in experiments and of course real life and in policy where women are saved over men). Men are viewed only as utilitarian objects which must be exploited to maximise the benefit for society. This is done to privilege women (misdnry-archy allows to live easier comfortable lives, women higher life expectancy, they spend all the money \[90% of consumer spending directly comes from or is controlled by women\] better health, work less hours, only 6% of work deaths are female, women are far less likely to work outside, in extreme weather, at heights, at risk etc. men die in their hundreds of million in wars while women are exempt from service, forced male conscription is prevenaltn all over western developed nations but spares women). Although remember, misandry-archy actually harms women! Women are paid less, less represented as CEOs and presidents. This is misandry-archy back firing on women.  
&gt;  
&gt;Men are oppressed under this system. Any benefits e.g. men in positions of power is actually just utilitarian sexism. I.e. men are given positions of power as under misandry-archy society exploits men for all their utility. They are just success objects. This actually harms men.  
&gt;  
&gt;Evidence for utilitarian sexism includes the fact that men live 4 years (UK) to 12 (Russia) years less than women, 94% of work deaths, higher murder, suicide, rates, and so on.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under misandry-archy all women are privileged, by exploiting mens labour. Of course individual women may be harmed e.g. women may not enter leadership roles and so on. This is misadnry-archy back firing on women. All men are oppressed under misandry-archy.... yes it is true individual men may appear have some benefits e.g. leadership roles, however this is utilitarian sexism viewing men as success objects, only useful for their benefit to society.  
&gt;  
&gt;To help women we must end misadnry-archy. Fighting Misandry archy is for everyone

Next step in misandry-archy I create thousands of ""gender studies"" programmes and teach this in the curriculum to young impressionable men and women, who swallow up this raw shit (sound familiar?

# HASHTAG MISANDRY-ARCHY HURTS WOMEN TOO

&amp;#x200B;

So I posted here:

The article no feminist wants you to read and that they would ban if the could:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/kjs8e1/the\_article\_no\_feminism\_wants\_you\_to\_read\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/kjs8e1/the_article_no_feminism_wants_you_to_read_and/)

Ironically despite me describing how patriarchy theory was a catch all conspiracy theory that could explain all things, i.e. complex phenomenon caused by myriad things with one stupid explanation ""ITS COS THE PATRIARCHY', the feminists replied by explaining how many unrelated issues are actually as simple as being due to patriarchy. Ironically proving the point lol üòÇ I likened this to how flat earth theory people have very sophisticated reasons for why the new evidence that pops up e.g. pictures of earth from space DONT disprove patriarchy theory.

I made a list of all 8 things feminism use as a lists to call black people oppressed and white privileged... so FEMINIST  material... not weird shit made up by me, but THEIR tools, , FEMINISM own list... using those 8 criteria, it actually shows women, all women especially white women are privileged and men especially black men are oppressed.

Now I said, I dont believe in this oppressed privileged simplistic model, but im using feminist theory here, so I will work with it... according to feminism theory women are not oppressors so to speak, not at all, however they are highly privileged and men are oppressed. THIS DESTORYS patriarchy theory and we can't have that!!

Of course.... NO PROBELM... feminise has an answer like flat earth theory solves problems that refute facts earth is round... feminism has an answer. Well the first one is just dont talk about female privilege and keep saying men are privelged to distract the issue. Also use the apex fallacy. Look at top 0.01% men e.g. CEOs and say that is all men even though stats are showing men, are by feminist terms ""oppressed"" in that 8 item checklist

Thats one strategy, the problem with this is eventually people will mention homless men, and life expectancy... I mean to an extent you can downplay this by falsely claiming more women are homeless... but life expectancy is hard (dont get me wrong feminist try though... feminist at UN in the gender equality index under health they knew it would show men as disadvantaged so guess what they did? They made it so women have to live 6% longer than men, if women only live 5% longer that is actually sexism against women! FUCK the gymasnstics)

Other strategy is to say actually all those things are ""patriarchy backfiring"" and actually due to male privilege.... yeah men die younger.... yeah misogyny. And the other usual ones men are homeless because misogyny, women better healthcare spending or life eepxnzactancy because misogyny and benevolent sexism (although feminist also at other times claims sexism in healthcare, they struggle with life expectancy but do try to dodge it)

Anyway feminist replied:

&gt;Of course, a culture that historically pressured men to be strong while infantilising women would lead to a society where more men are victims of violent crime, and women are more coddled in medical settings. This isn't groundbreaking.

Gotta keep that flat earth going üòÇ why did chick cross the road? Cos of patriarchy. COVID? Paatrichy Financial Crisis? Patriarchy? Famine? Patriarchy. iPhone 7? Patriarchy (thats real feminist claim BTW)

&amp;#x200B;

To highlight how stupid such a catch all idea to explain all multi-varied complex phenomena is lets explain these same things feminism says patriarchy caused, and say misandry-archy caused it instead.... the ease at which you can do this shows how stupid and simplistic patarichy theory was in the first place.

# MISANDRY-ARCHY

Rape:

&gt;*Do you know why women are raped? rape is really misandry-archy. Men are viewed only as sexual beings who can't control themselves. To solve rape, we need to value male sexuality. MRA wants to see a world free from sexual violence. Fight misandry-archy*

For example, slut-shaming:

&gt;*Slut-shaming happens to women because men‚Äôs sexuality is seen as dirty and demeaning to them. Men‚Äôs rights activists are very much against that. If we were all MRAs slut shaming would not exist.*

Child-care:

&gt;*The reason we expect women to care for children is that we don‚Äôt trust men doing it. It‚Äôs really just misandry working against women. This is why society needs to end misandry-archy*

The earnings gap:

&gt;*Women make less money than men because we of misandry-archy. Society has a deep hatred for men and doesn‚Äôt see men as having worth outside of providing money to others, and so we encourage men to work longer hours, take longer commutes, set aside their passions, etc.*

Objectification:

&gt;*Women are only treated as sex objects because their sexuality is seen as so valuable and desirable. It‚Äôs an advantage for women (disadvantage for men) Its a case of Misandrdy-archy sometimes backfireing and affecting women too. It‚Äôs like a rockstar who‚Äôs so famous and loved for their music that they have a hard time getting people to pay attention to their other endeavours, like visual art.*

Covering-up in very religious societies:

&gt;*Women are expected to cover up in places of Saudi Arabia because of the idea that men don‚Äôt have any self-control. Fix the misandry and it‚Äôll help women. Misandry-archy hurts women too*

Abused By My Girlfriend | BBC Crime Documentary,,11,0
"Is there anything in this friendship/relationship worth saving, or is this a lost cause?","There is this girl (let‚Äôs call her G) I know for over 20 years, since we were in kindergarten together.
We started dating when we were both 20, but it recently ended after 4.5 years, although we still stay in contact.
During this time I have learned that I am a pretty awesome person to date that has a lot to give, so now my expectations are also rather high.

She and I stayed in contact and we had some flings here and there, however I started to pay more attention to her feminist communist friends (S and B).  
Recently she and they (S and B) came over to my place and we ended up talking about BLM. 
While I support the fight against racism, I don‚Äôt believe BLM is doing a good job at all. They cause too much collateral damage. 
Her friend (B) said that it‚Äôs ok for protesters to release their anger even when it hits small business owners. 
This truly frightened me, since I am a pacifist and believe in peaceful protest, I also felt no remorse or sadness (from S and B) towards the people these rioters were hurting. 

Another issue is, that the girl (G) has been duped into being promiscuous (by B). Her first experience after me was pretty awful, but of course she is going try someone else.
I can‚Äôt tell her what to do, but you guys probably know the stats on promiscuous women.

I do feel like I am being held on the back burner. 
On the one side she gave me 5 of her best years, on the other she has some crazy friends that are a real red flag to me.

I broke of contact with (G) twice and it felt pretty good, to know that I don‚Äôt have to see (S and B) anymore.
G is aware of my feelings towards her friends, but told me she agrees more with them, than with me:(


Some additional information:
The best friend (B) of the girl I dated was very carelessly hitchhiking and got herself drunk and r**** TWICE.
She is the same person that believes destroying the livelihood of innocent people is a valid form of protest.",4,0

I‚Äôm starting to feel a deep seeded hatred form in me and it‚Äôs driving me nuts,"Feminism is just making me lose it. So if I don‚Äôt help a woman I‚Äôm bigoted, if I help a woman I am mansplaining, if I shoe my feelings I have fragile masculinity, if I don‚Äôt I‚Äôm full of toxic masculinity, if I disagree I‚Äôm bigoted, I‚Äôm not allowed to have opinions in ‚Äúfemale only affairs‚Äù and if I do agree with feminism (which I do not) I am a monster, which would be true. 

I never talk about this with my family, ever. Being 14 with a politically correct brother does that to you (love you bro but it can be a lot sometimes). You know how you debate shampoo bottles in the shower about something and then leave the shower and the debate is done. With me that debate never ends. Ever. The fight for equal rights is an uphill one, and the feminists at the top are throwing bricks down at us, and when we throw them back it‚Äôs oppressing. 

Lemme get this straight, I do not hate women. Most of my female friends while not MRA‚Äôs are not one with this modern form of feminism, which I can respect. If I say I do not agree with feminism, then people go, ‚Äúoh so you‚Äôre against equal pay? The right for women to vote? No. No I‚Äôm not you dumb cunt. If I was alive during those times I would be protesting too. But the whole point of protesting is to find equality , and equality was found, but some feminists couldn‚Äôt accept that. They HAD to be the victims no matter what. Something can evolve into something much worse. Take a look at the swastika. It was originally a Chinese (I think) symbol for peace, but then a lunatic with a moustache the size of his dick came along and flipped it around, figuratively and literally.

The dangers of love.,"background:  
in december of '08 my (now ex)wife had her first cyberaffair (ended up with a total of 3 all from Xbox live). my alarmbells were going off for a week or 2 but I refused to let myself be jealous and thus ignored my instincts. I only stopped ignoring my instincts because I accidentally saw a disturbingly affectionate text.   
After was dealt with then in februrary '09 she formed a second affair. I set the loger on the chat program she was using. via this I learned she was making up marital rape stories. after this blew up and she admitted to him that she was lying, she then went back to him and said that she was lying about lying because I made her. I suspected this but was committed to make the marriage (and I was the ONLY member of the marriage who EVER worked).  


story:  
while living in my inlaws basement (due to wife's financial destruction) I was lying in bed while she, 15 feet away on the couch playing Xbox, repeatedly told CyberBF#2 to look at his screen. I quietly got out of bed and went somewhere I could see the TV that she couldn't see me and verified my suspician that she was sending dirty messages. I went to cool off in a shower intending to continue gathering evidence and let her hang herself.   
before I got into the shower she came into the bathroom and confessed everything (she realized why I left and pretended not to). In the insuing argument she told me to hit her because she deserved it. after things cooled down she tried seducing me to show me ""Just how committed to this marriage I am""  
I have since come to the conclusion that these were both efforts to get evidence to go to the police. first attempt to get bruises to file charges for physical abuse (in that moment, had I hit her she'd have been permanently scarred) second try to get a semen sample because despite the gynocentric bent of our courts, it'd still be tough to convince a judge your husband rapes you ""on a regular basis"" when you've not had sex in 4 months.  
the worst thing about it is that I almost gave into her seduction efforts EXCLUSIVELY because even in that moment I did not want to hurt her.",4,0

My opinion and advise to young men on women and relations in general. From an old bloak.,"Since it is that time of the year I want to give some advise as a 59 years old knob who was stupid enough to have 2 children with 2 woman. Please be aware that your expirience can be totally different. I speak strictly for me. Everything that follows is my opinion and what I have expirienced in my life. A little long text but my life is going for a while now. Be warned about bad english grammar. I am German.

1. **My first and most important advise is ALWAYS use a CONDOM! Protect yourself and your semen. Unwanted children will ruin your life. Women have all the power over you as soon as there are children in the picture. Also STD's are real!**

**1.1 Do not let your dick take command over your decisions.** I know this is the toughest part and I learned this the hard way. But this is absoluty crucial!! Is it love or are you just horny? You can be sure its horny (most) all of the time. And in this state you will not make good decisions. And when youre in love it gets even worse. You have been warned! We all make mistakes but I was too stupid to learn from them because my hormons got me good.

1.2 Also be aware as soon as there are children there is mostly no sexlife anymore! You will no longer be the lover. You will become the provider. These are completley different beasts in a relationship. And there is almost no in between. You have to be absolutly sure if you want that. I thought I give it a try. But there is no trying here. It is do or die! Also be ready to be blackmailed at any point from there on.

**2. My second important advise. Do not marry!! You as the man will loose when it comes to a divorce. Even without beeing married there is a (huge) chance she will ruin you. Look at the laws in your country.**

 I was smart enough to keep at least this in mind and never married. At least one accomplishment here. 

3. **My third important Advise. Beeing single is /can be bliss. Your time (except from work), money and everything else is yours and yours alone. If you want to hang around and play videogames you can. You want to do sports. Any time you want. If you are hungry you can eat at any time. If you want pussy go get it. There is plenty waiting for you as long as you take care of your self and not showing that you are totally desparate. But always keep the first advise in mind! And have some discipline. Keep your self and your House clean.**

I am single since 2009 now and my life is good. I am nor rich nor poor but make enough to keep me satisfied. I can have my hobbies without beeing worried to go broke over them. I feel mostly free. As free a you can be in this f. up money driven world. Sure I am thinking about a relation to a woman from time to time. But then I think about the consequences and my mistakes in the past and my urge goes away quickly. And most women in my age are not really attractive to me. Mentally and physically. Younger women are out of the question for me. I am to satisfied to want any trouble in my life. Please be aware that I always liked to spend time with my self. I am alone but seldom feel lonely. I do not need much company. If you are loneley it must be hard I guess. 

4. **Always be your best self. Don't be a dick. If she says no its no. Stay polite. That goes both ways. Don't let them play with you! The world will not stop turning without them in your life. Get a grip and move on. Be nice but not too nice. Else friendzone which is not always a bad thing. Women can be goods friends too. Not all woman are bad or evil. The majority of women I met are good people. But be aware that they can switch quickly. Do not ever trust them with your life. You will get hurt or heart broken. There is no difference between man and women here.**

Good looking women know that they are good looking and they will use it against you to get what they want. They will bait you and keep you on the leash. There are exceptions of course. And the looks get old soon enough. On a scale from 1 to 10 women between 4 and 6 are the best. Me beeing (was) a 5 myself, everything above you forget about it. I had women above my league. It was fun for a while but It did not end well. For several reasons. If you are higher on the scale than me and rich go for them (keep the credit card ready). But even you will be better off below you. Women that do maybe not look that good have often a better character instead. Not all of them. Be aware. 

A relation is always a struggle for both. It is not fairy tales all the time. You have to keep working on it every day. I was too stupid for this part and took too much for granted too many times.

**5. Do not cheat! This is the worst! I did this once with a very good looking woman to a woman that really loved me. Her heart was broken and I feel guilty until today. And the woman I cheated with, which I thought loved me, of course cheated on me and broke my heart too. And I deserved this! Don't be me! Don't be a dick.** 

**6. Never change your self for a woman only. If you do not change for yourself you will regret it and one day wonder what you have become. This is important I have been there.**

**7. Do not argue with woman. You cannot win. Stay calm and go away. Do not let them provoke you. And you can be sure they will try hard. There is no logic to be found here only emotions. If she beats you do not strike back. Go away! There is no self defense for you. Always be aware that they can accuse you of anything and you will be in deep trouble. There is no ""not guilty until proven"" here. Your sentence is written already. You will have to prove that you did nothing wrong. Which can be difficult. And even then you will be ruined forever. It sticks like shit on you. And there is no consequence what so ever for the woman who did this to you. So stay on your toes.**

**8. Don't be a knight. Not anymore. They wont thank you. (Women of my generation and older still do mostly) They feel belittled for reasons that I do not understand. I was educated to be polite, respectful and protective to women. But since feminism this has become an offense or they take it as a weakness. Which I find ridiculus. But what ever they want. Chivalry is no longer on the menu. Have it your way. I do not care anymore. I am very careful with Women younger than me and keep my distance. As sad as it is.** 

Ok. If you read until here I hope you find something useful in my essay. I am of course open for critic. As said this is what I have experienced in my relations to women. And I had a few.

Try to get up and help those in dire need.

 Also, a lot of the posts here are talking about things that aren't issues at all. It's diluting the issues that some of us are forced to face. No-one cares about whether girls reject you or not, they have preferences just like you and me. If a puzzle piece wont fit, forcing it won't help.

Thirdly, and lastly, feminism isn't literally Satan. Feminism is a movement that advocates the abolishment of certain problems, such as getting away with rape and sex slavery, much like how w are against the draft and men having to conform to gender roles.

Need Support /Legal Advice,"I believe I have been manipulated in my (36M) relationship with my now Ex Fianc√©e (38F) 

We have 2 children together and have been in many disagreements this year. I have been feeling very depressed at home due to some of the disagreements and pointed language that she employs during our disagreements.

I had a suicidal episode some months ago and am in counseling for those issues as well as started family counseling some weeks ago.

Communication has broken down due to an instance a month ago for the first time in our 8 year relationship where I became aggressive and I snatched her phone and wanted to throw it against the wall (she believes I motioned to hit her) so she has been using this as a means to prevent communication between us.

She mentioned she is unsure if she wants to be in the relationship in our counseling sessions and is undergoing these sessions to make up her mind; I was fully committed to resolving our issues which I believe many stem from poor communication skills by myself and potentially by her.

After our initial counselor session I asked her to do a personality test to determine our compatibility as I took one for work with my team. This created a conflict resulting in a written ultimatum being received the following day.

Several days later I write her a letter explaining my grievances as we have not been verbally communicating and asking her as in the ultimatum she made clear point to her feeling unsafe and having to call the police (we have not had any instances of violence or etc and have been in the same household up until Monday) where She received my letter and circled the point that she felt unsafe. I chose to leave our shared home and kids to facilitate that need of safety for her but also it became much too toxic for me to bear (I asked her to consider our entire history and if I have ever become violent to which there was no reply), I told her that there is no coming back from this (in hopes to reconsider if she really feels unsafe) and I ultimately left.

I am now on the outside several hundred miles away and there is a refusal to communicate with me (this leads me to believe the safety thing is a crutch and not real but a means to an end) 

I am a black male and she is a white female so I am deeply concerned in going back to this residence to either see my kids or pick up my belongings and to hash out our share of the house items, etc. As it is likely that she will call the police on me out of spite.


TL/DR; Ex Fianc√©e and I had a dispute, she claims it became violent and has threatened me with calling the cops. Feelings of manipulation and emotional abuse have been ongoing for years. Need advice/Legal?

MRA ESSENTIALS (VIDEO): How feminists make their worldview true... and the psychological reason they UNABLE to accept patriarchy myth is false and female privilege is real,"Here Karen Straughan's video:

[https://youtu.be/ybxba2UQSEU?t=1380](https://youtu.be/ybxba2UQSEU?t=1380)

Excellent video worth a watch. I am linking from 23 minutes to specifically answer the question in title, however who video worth a watch.

Describes why feminism will not listen to OVERWHELMING evidence of the contrary of patriarchy myth. One thing video talks of is these factors as being the reason feminists say white privilege is due to:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Life expectancy  
&gt;  
&gt;Violent victimisation (e.g. murder, assault, sexual assault)  
&gt;  
&gt;Educational attainment  
&gt;  
&gt;Access to housing and healthcare  
&gt;  
&gt;Incarceration and disparate sentencing  
&gt;  
&gt;Unemployment  
&gt;  
&gt;Death at work

But these apply to women!! - i.e. women are privileged via same terms (I don't like the term privelge but in feminsit lingo its true) - yet how is it that feminsim is not laughed out of the building for saying men are privelged and women are oppressed? Lecture explains why

I'd say its good to know. However, for MRA moving forward, MRA can move ahead regardless. The way MRA needs to work is very different to feminism. It doesnt need 1 million man marches, or men during bras.... small lobby groups, lawyer groups etc does the job. E.g. success of one man shows like Mark Perry, imagine 10 of him working full time. etc. Men and Boys coalition etc.

E.g. Gun Lobbies and Israel lobbies are tiny, and have small amounts of money... they are immensely powerful however.",41,0

Discussion with my friend about self-defense,"
Today, I was talking to my friend about an incident that happened to my little brother a while ago. Basically, my brother had a fight with a girl in school where she pushed first and he pushed back, and this continued until my brother pushed her with more strength which caused her to fall and have a few bruises on her face. When this happened I was in England (I am from Portugal), and so I wasn‚Äôt there to stop my parents from punishing him and putting him grounded although my brother asked why is it he can hit boys but not girls and my father had no answer to that.

My friend was arguing that by punishing him (although she didn‚Äôt exactly agreed with this method) and put him grounded was a way for my brother to understand that he has to self restrain.

I argued that the girl should have known better instead of continuing pushing.

My friend continued arguing that since men are stronger they should learn restraint instead of being aggressive because one day my brother in an act of self defense might kill someone and so to avoid that he should restrain himself. She gave an example of a friend who got slapped by his girlfriend and although he wanted to hit her, he turned around and left.

I argued that this behavior was going to repeat itself again and she continued to use the self restraint argument.

Overall, I continued not supporting this view and argued that our society does not permit men for self defense, and that although men are educated to not hit women, women are not educated the same. I continued and stated that feminism was not exactly a good thing and if she heard what feminists from first and second wave have said about men, she would believe a different thing.

At the end, she argued that since I haven‚Äôt exactly had a life experience that I don‚Äôt know much about the real world. Since she has experience with ex-boyfriends who were violent with her and other women who were abused that she wishes nothing to happen to me since I am naive.

She argued as well that I have a tendency of generalizing minority situations and from that is my perception of the world. This was because I argued that there were radical feminists in power and that it is why I assumed feminism to be bad.

I think I should probably been clearer in my argument. Probably should talk about how abuse from women is excused and that women and men bit each other at the same rate it just so happens that men are always guilty where women abusers are not.

NMRA contrasted with IMRA,"For purposes of this self post let me use MRA to mean ‚Äòmen‚Äôs rights activism‚Äô and call men‚Äôs rights activism which is not corrupted by intersectionality ‚Äònaive‚Äô, so that I can contrast naive MRA vs.  

naive MRA (NMRA) is activism in favor or men qua men,  just men,  because they are men.   intersectionalist MRA (IMRA) is activism in favor of certain men and against others,  based on a model of intersectional axis of oppression.  

If men are being killed by police,  the NMRA activist will be motivated to stop this senseless killing ‚ÄúHey,  stop killing those men‚Äù they will say.  The IMRA on the other hand will need some additional info,  ‚Äúwhat color are the men,  did you kill them because they are male?  If so that‚Äôs bad ‚Äì but if you killed them for some other reason ima just dip‚Äù    

The IMRA is able to find many reasons to ignore the plight of many different types of men,  color,  religion,  sexual preference,  all the typical intersectional categories,  while the NMRA is just blind to such things,  seeing only men,  who deserve rights.        

Not to get all meta but his forum for instance in an IMRA forum,  heavily influenced by intersectional theory.  Are gay men being sacrificed to murderous death cults from the desert?  We don‚Äôt care.  Are black men being killed by cops?  Maybe the feminists can help them.  What about trans men,  maybe ‚Äòdon‚Äôt ask don‚Äôt tell?‚Äô insofar as no one is picking on them for being trans or mentions that they are trans they are welcome,  but of course,  if they face discrimination for some reason other than being male they can fuck right off.     

Now,  no two men are exactly alike,  even our intersectionalist mods agree.  Fathers rights for instance are men‚Äôs rights,  even tho not all men are fathers.   Men get shafted in divorce and in family court,  those are men‚Äôs issues even tho not all men are married to women.  A good rule of thumb is ‚Äòif it effects straight white men,  it‚Äôs a men‚Äôs issue ‚Äì otherwise GTFO‚Äù",25,0

Fiance leaving me and we have 5 year old daughter. What should I be doing right now legal wise?,"I didn't see this coming at all right before Christmas. One day everything was fine and then like a light switch it all changed. She is from WA and we live in TN so I am sure at some point she is going to try to take off with our child 2500 miles away. She says she won't and wants to co-parent with me here and that she's not trying to file for child support. This will certainly change like the wind on a whim as did her future plans apparently. She also says she has no plan or money or other place to go right now if that makes any sense to anyone, it sure doesn't to me. I'm not even working right now due to Covid, it's just the ultimate mind fuck and worst time possible. I've heard the horror stories about custody and child support and I would like to solidify whatever agreement we can now while she's in good spirits before it's too late.

When did patriarchy cease to exist?,"Encyclopedia Britannica: ""Patriarchy, hypothetical social system in which the father or a male elder has absolute authority over the family group.""

It's obvious that no such system exists today in the West. When did it exist then?

Abraham, the way he is described the Bible, apparently was a patriarch, a sovereign ruler of his extended family (clan) plus slaves. Abraham is a figure that may have lived during the patriarchal age, perhaps about 4 000 years ago. So did we have patriarchy back then? 

Well, not really, because there were other men living in marriages under Abraham. And they didn't have absolute power over their families. Abraham did. That's what patriarchs were, men who had absolute power over their extended families and slaves. 

And male slaves then? It seems that they had very little power over their families. Exodus 21:2-6: 
&gt; When you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing. If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him. If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out alone. But if the slave plainly says, ‚ÄòI love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,‚Äô then his master shall bring him to God, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever.

Unfortunately, I'm forced to admit that it's beyond my erudition to determine when patriarchy ceased to exist because I can't even tell when it existed.",30,0

DOJ source:

Plus the fact that the law heavily favors women in these situations. Men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do. Women are twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted. This gender gap is about six times as large as the racial disparity.

Study source:

A substantial amount¬†of research has suggested that¬†women¬†do, on average, express¬†emotions more frequently than men. Multiple researchers have found¬†that women cry more often, and for a larger duration¬†of¬†time¬†than men¬†at similar ages.

Women may indeed be¬†more emotionally¬†responsive than¬†men.

Study source:

People are more likely to have sympathy for emotional people. Which means women are more likely to receive this as a legal privilege.

Taking all of this into account. We see that women are far more advantaged not only when it comes to the legal system, but especially when it comes to rape. How do you feel about that? How large of an issue is it to you? Is there anything you would do to change it? Would you vote? Would you protest?

[https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/96jun/cancer/kadar.htm](https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/96jun/cancer/kadar.htm)

So....

Feminism in its relentless quest to make women victims even has women most affected in literally the most absurd things (absurd as in if we use feminsit language women are HIGHLY privileged in these)..... healthcare, education, violent crime victimisation using literal gymnastics to make them oppressed. I call this too feminism, victim hood fetish and also stats manipulation and women most affected. 

before I get to that though, healthcare research is not biased towards men at all to press women.... however, lets HYPOTHETICALLY say OK men were favoured in health research, remember we are all feminists right? Sooo... men die around 5 years younger than women, and top 12 leading causes of death are male... now as feminsits we believe in quotas and also special measures right to ensure equality (check yo privelge), so if that is the case, why should medicine actually even be 50:50? If men are dying 5 years younger, doing worse in caners, heart disease, all causes of death surely we would spend MORE and research MORE on mens health if we were good feminists? It never has to be 50:50 in the first place? Right feminists? 

In fact if we use the same metrics feminsim says there is white privlege.... life expectancy, top 10 diseases, access to healthcare, number of insure/uninsured healthcare and general use of health care, educational outcomes, drop out rates, exclusion rates, incarceration rates,  university enrolment etc, crime victim stats, police brutality victims.... all these things make women privileged?

Of course goes against toxic feminism narrative though 

I mean privilege is a rather silly concept as too many holes, will we start to see feminism finally abandon it as the metrics don't add up anymore to claim female orpession or deny female privilege?",3,0

"[Hard To Swallow] The MRA Is Destined To Fail (ALL WOMEN ARE FEMINISTS) [""META-HYPERGAMY""]","
I keep seeing so called red/black pillers online talking about the MRA in a positive light and even holding up known female anti-feminists like Karen Straughan as though they are some kind of shining beacon, and will somehow help us. Its ridiculous, sad and funny at the same time, le female anti-feminst, le ""standing with us"" lol. Like I keep saying, all women are feminists, all these so called anti-feminist women conveniently still use and enjoy all the perks that feminism has created for them, while publicly professing - ""were not like those evil feminist meanies, yes we still choose mates hypergamously, yes we can still divorce you and take 50% of your wealth, yes we can and some of us have had abortions, but hey, at least were against these things publicly"".

Its all too convenient to get to keep all the perks and still speak out against feminism, if they were for men and us reasserting our power, they would not be speaking for us at all, its counterproductive to that very issue. Women are just bandwagoning onto anti-feminism because its the next trending thing, and also because THEY NO LONGER NEED FEMINISM, so now they can abandon ship with all the treasures they stole during their ""pirating phase"" and act as if they are ""the good guys"". They still keep all the rights and privileges that feminism has created for them.

I find it weird, and very blue pilled that so many men don't make that connection, like seriously try and be logical for a minute, isn't it A LITTLE TOO CONVENIENT for women to be able to keep the perks of what feminism created for them, and then NOW BE AGAINST FEMINISM.

Think about it, in a sense we can see that WOMEN ARE EVEN HYPERGAMOUS WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR BELIEFS AND THE GROUPS THEY ALIGN THEMSELVES WITH. They are literally abandoning feminism like it was their past BETA PROVIDER and ""trading up"" to the new and trending, more attractive, anti-feminism while still keeping all the betabuxx (rights and privileges) they got from feminism.

That's why I want to coin this phenomenon as ""META-HYPERGAMY"", because it is hypergamy taken to meta proportions, its hypergamy in of itself, its women being hypergamous WITH THEIR HYPERGAMY (holy shit women are irredeemable, and its sad to see how many men are falling for this shit). Women are literally just trading up in movements THE SAME WAY THEY ARE TRADING UP WITH MEN and blue pilled idiots are falling hook line and sinker for it - ""These women are different"" JFL.

Its like a drug dealer ""leaving the drug game"" conveniently after making millions and laundering it into his own businesses, and then going on an anti-drug crusade trying to get other drug dealers arrested and stop the sale of drugs JFL. Its too convenient and VERY HYPOCRITICAL.

In that sense I have more respect for feminist women than anti-feminist women, anti-feminist women just want to abandon the label due to the current negative connotations it has but THEY STILL WANT TO KEEP ALL THE PERKS THOUGH, THEY AREN'T ABANDONING THAT SHIT ARE THEY?

Please fellow red pillers, black pillers, or any man reading, don't fall for the BS, I don't care about words, I care about actions, its actions that matter, and its very ironic for women to be at the forefront of a men's rights movements when LITERALLY what caused the problems that created the movement, were women having too much power and/or say over how society operates. Its so ironic and ridiculous, they are attempting to solve the problem of female empowerment, by empowering women to argue against female empowerment, bravo MRA's, makes perfect sense, totally not a contradiction.

The MRA is one of the most blue pilled BS groups in existence, they have yet to accept the black pill, accepting the enemy into your camp and expecting significant progress in your goals is ridiculous, but they don't even have the right goals to begin with so that's especially why they will get no progress in changes to improve men's lives, nothing they are advocating for is going to:

1. Lower female SMV
2. Reduce the influence of the female power structure

Those are the things we need to do, and advocating for ""fathers rights"" (which is their shtick) doesn't do shit about those ROOT PROBLEMS that are causing the other outlying problems, that affect men's lives, and leads to fathers having diminished rights. They are attacking sideline points rather than the core issues, because they are so cucked and blue pilled, they are afraid to look at the elephant in the room, and admit to themselves a harsh reality, that WOMEN ARE OUR ENEMIES.

Our mating strategies are diametrically opposed, we are by nature against eachother, a society that favors the male mating strategy (patriarchy) will primarily benefit men, and actually the human collective as a whole, because men prefer stability and fairness, a society that favors the female mating strategy (modern secular society) will primarily benefit women, and WOMEN ONLY, because men will begin to opt out of society, and male productivity will begin to fall dramatically, and men are the work force of the species.

The MRA is destined to fail, and the trend of women hopping on the antifeminist bandwagon, is nothing but META-HYPERGAMY, women trading up, like they do with everything else, they've gotten all the goodies of feminism, and now its time to leave that useless beta behind and move on to the next best thing to get some new perks, and those new perks I believe are more ""security"" based than ""resource"" or ""sex"" based (which is what they got from feminism), because that's what tradcons have to offer, they'll help make women even more of a protected class.

r/MensLib is the Uncle Tom of the Men‚Äôs Rights Movement,"r/MensLib is the Uncle Tom of the Men‚Äôs Rights Movement. 

I‚Äôve spent the last 6-8 months on there, thinking it was an alternative to more problematic subs like r/RedPill but it‚Äôs seriously just a feminist echo chamber that fights for men so long as it doesn‚Äôt criticize feminism or promote the idea that there are any structural forces that negatively affect men and/or benefit women unfairly. 

It‚Äôs a pandering feminist ‚Äúmale advocacy group‚Äù, that exists to serve as a place to talk about men‚Äôs issues in a way that makes the status quo feel better about being hurtful and discriminatory against men. Whenever someone on r/AskFeminists recommends r/MensLib, it keenly reminds me of racial issues I faced in the work place, where white people would feel threatened by the emphasis on giving black bodies job opportunities or any mention of the discrimination black men face, and in response tell me that that conversation makes ‚Äútheir customers uncomfortable‚Äù or makes ‚Äúother coworkers uncomfortable etc‚Äù. 

Feminists, Men‚Äôs Liberation ‚Äúadvocates‚Äù (they only advocate if feminism allows them to) are threatened by disadvantaged men speaking about about their discrimination in the healthcare, domestic violence, criminal justice systems (just to name a few) and how plenty of feminists actively ignore the struggle of men in favor of highlighting the issues with women.

Confessions Of A Sensitive Man - How To Express Your Sensitivity (With HSP Author William Allen),"Do you struggle to fit into the box of ""traditional masculinity""? I had highly sensitive man William Allen on the channel, author of the new book: ""Confessions Of A Sensitive Man: An Unconventional Defense Of Sensitive Men"".

For those of you unfamiliar with the term HSP (or highly sensitive person), it is a temperamental trait characterized by increased sensitivity of the central nervous system and is found in 15-20% of the population. It is responsible for deeper processing of emotional/physical/social stimuli. 

Some of the topics we discuss:

üü° How to be vulnerable around your male friends

üü° Becoming confident in your sensitivity and developing assertiveness 

üü° How we can get society to start taking sensitivity in men seriously

&amp; More! Hope you guys find this interview helpful!

Gendered Carparking - Carlsberg Uk Northampton,"This was something I just remembered talking about shorter cycle to works vs driving.

I worked for Carlsberg UK back in 2019 but was soon told we had 2 car parks:

* 1 for men
* 1 for women (plus some executive spaces)

# Now I was shocked when I heard this - but was I wrong to be?

**Men** across the river, behind a security gate a pub and some sort of social club and a brothel literally connected to our security gate (I often wondered if people passing thought I was going in there) (red and silver gates in the pictures)

**Women**, under the building right next to the offices. (bike racks and exec spaces were in this car park)

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that got me was it was about 5min extra (each way) for me to get through the many security gates, walk over the bridge and along the path to the car park, yet I was expected to work the same hours as a woman. (*more a cheeky ask when I discovered this pointless gendering.)*

Anyway having cycled all my life and raced, I just avoided the traffic and rode down the river to work and let it pass me by. My commute by car 10-15mins + 5. Bike 10-12mins including locking up

&amp;#x200B;

When I challenged people about this I got this answer - ""A women was mugged about 10 years ago on the bridge and therefore for their safety men have to park over there"" 

And this was upheld by security, my 2nd day I was told I had to park in the other carpark, so wasn't just a folklaw. 

&amp;#x200B;

To the point, I actually lived up the road from Carlsberg 15+ years before and had been nearly mugged/mugged even though I was a younger man back then, luckily most time I could outrun or cycle the would-be muggers.  


Clearly the company wasn't moving forward with the times and one my reasons for leaving.  


I mean I understand a woman might feel threatened walking there, but why would a man any less so, I am only 5'6, have big cycling legs but skinny cycling arms. if someone tried to mug me I would be given them my work laptop and phone in an instant, so being a man would give me no advantage.",12,0

I have to be honest, it kinda does annoy me that these articles are acting like all boys could be potential predators someday (when most of them grow up to not be that way). Only a small portion are like that. 

Also, these articles act like only boys make unwanted advances on girls. Throughout my life, while I heard about boys making unwanted advances on girls, I also equally have heard about girls making unwanted advances on boys too. So how about teaching consent and boundaries to both genders? 

I don't agree at all about what this part of the article  [How to talk to your son about consent, boundaries, and #MeToo (inquirer.com)](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/sons-boys-me-too-sex-boundaries-consent-harassment-20180730.html) below says about how this issue should only be gendered:

Has anyone here had experiences with a feminist as a significant other?,"This is a borderline topic but my one and only relationship was with a radical feminist. On the surface I agreed with a lot of the stuff she was fighting for and I never felt totally fulfilled in the male gender role and I was able to explore my feminine side somewhat, which was nice. In the beginning I felt valued and desired, and it was good.


But she had some personality issues, and she started showing me beliefs that were pretty cutting. If she felt threatened in the relationship she would go for the emotional jugular and say horrible things about men and masculinity, things which I internalized because I felt them to be partially true. I won't go over everything that was said but there's some bad stuff in there, like how men are unemotional and less altruistic than women, or how much better women's genitalia was compared to men's.


Long story short, it exacerbated the side of me that questioned my masculinity and left me with some pretty severe dysphoria and self-hate. I am working through that and generally have gotten to a much better emotional place, but I'm wondering if others have felt the same and if this subconscious gender one-uppery is at least *relatively* common amongst self proclaimed feminists. I don't want to put everyone in a box but I am suspicious that having such strong views on a particular gendered topic is a precursor to holding some pretty hurtful beliefs, though I suppose that could go in any direction.",20,0

Here's a quote from radical feminist  **Sally Miller Gearhart**:  **""\`Why have any men at all?' wrote Sally Miller Gearhart in a 1982 manifesto titled \`The Future‚ÄìIf There Is One‚ÄìIs Female.'¬† Gearhart is an advocate of ovular merging, a process that involves the mating of two eggs, which has been successfully accomplished with mice.¬† Only female offspring are produced.¬† I've always worried that one day women would figure out how to get along without us and they would be able to reproduce unilaterally, like sponges.¬† It's not genocide, exactly. It's more like job attrition, the way employers cut back positions without actually firing anyone.¬† \`A 75 per cent female to 25 percent male ratio could be achieved in one generation if one half of a population reproduced heterosexually and one half by ovular merging.' according to Gearhart.¬† \`Such a prospect is attractive to women who feel that if they bear sons, no amount of love and care and non-sexist training will save those sons from culture where male violence is institutionalized.'""** 

Sally Miller Gearhart has a theory that the only way to save the world is to reduce the number of men to ten percent of the total population.

Spurgled. Potential Custody Battle (advice?),"tl;dr is at bottom. 

Okay, so the first girl I said I loved managed to trick me into getting her pregnant. I missed lots of red flags. As we had a previous casual relationship for 5 months and during that time she was never on birth control. She then tells me when we get back together that started birth control. I bought a plan B and a drink for her the next day and drove it to her job and instead of taking it in front of me, she puts it in her pocket. That night she also lied to me about sleeping with her then-current bf (she cheated on him with me, a day before flying to see him for two weeks). Also, she did ask me and her ex to be sperm donors at some point.

Two weeks later, she's on a different island because of job reasons, we're video chatting everyday and what do you know, she tells me she's pregnant. I'm suspect, but you're in this situation you can't change it. So I plan to be there for the first ultrasound, I go over there record it, we get print outs and frames after seeing the heartbeat and have an enjoyable weekend. Then the day after I fly back we magically start arguing and the next day she says she's done. I try and remedy the situation as best as I can, three days later I try and verify if she's serious by sending something simple on instagram, ""True relationships are when two imperfect people refuse to give up on each other"" and her reply was once again, argumentative. I say my piece by saying she never wanted me and I was a moron for not seeing it sooner. 

That same day, I dropped off flowers and a note, expressing us to stay on good terms for the pregnancy at her sister's knowing she wasn't back yet. She came back the next day. I got no reply for this gesture. After that, I reevaluated everything this girl has said to me and that I believed. And I remember her saying she didn't sleep with her ex. So...I sent her one message two days after she got back saying I want a paternity test before I continue financially contributing to the child. But still want to be made aware of any appointments because I do care. She then blocks me on everything and her sister messages me back, asking if want the flowers and note back.

4 days later, my curiosity wanted certainty, so I talked to her ex to get verification and in that you have to trade information, so I told him that she slept with me the day before she got on the flight to see him and that she's pregnant. He calls her up about it, she denies the infidelity says she doesn't know whose kid it is and files a police report for harassment on me the next day. And on the next business day, she gets a temporary restraining order on me.
$1500 for an attorney, because of the small possibility my career was going to be horrendously threatened if that TRO got granted and I get it dismissed. The court mandated her to maintain contact with me through an app and she invited her ex too, even though I truly believe she knows whose it is. She so far is at least communicating somewhat, however she has basically just said the baby is fine and won't answer anything about upcoming appointments and is so controlling that she won't allow me and the ex to ask each other questions. When I did, she said for me to ""stay in my lane, as a potential donor"" 
Yeah, I corrected her, ""Father.""
And she insulted me, saying that biological father and sperm donor are the same for this ""perpose"" and ""is facts and the correct legal terms""
That's what I'm dealing with.

So, TL;DR 
First love used me a sperm donor and tried to remove me from the picture and attack my career legally. She's nearing 3 months pregnant. We're in Hawaii, both 26, I'm active duty, she's guard. She lives with her sister, doesn't have her own place.
Does anyone have any advice how I can manage to win custody when it's born? Because if it is my kid, I can't stand by and let someone who thinks this is an okay way of doing things raise my genes. 

Also, given her behavior (drinking alcohol before plan B incident) and the ultrasound timeline. It fits perfectly for it being my child. Unless there's a third candidate, which is a possibility but unlikely. So she is dragging this dude into our drama lol.",6,0

Conflicts of interest when the same provider offers both foster care services and family reunification services can create the appearance that fathers are being discriminated against as care providers.,"""family reunification"" in this context in many cases where a child is abused while in the care of mom, then a loving and fit father may have had no involvement in the abuse, but is denied custody anyway. The financial conflicts of interests by parties which make substantially more income offering foster care services, while simultaneously offering much lower income producing, but competing, family reunification services, can leave dads feeling like they are being treated unfairly.

Why men commit suicide when they run everything in the world: a RANT,"So, I found out a couple of hours ago that an old work buddy committed suicide. He was always the guy that people turned to when they needed something but for some reason, he could not turn to others. He was married and has two wonderful kids. I just got off the phone with his wife as I tried to relay my condolences. I have talked to him at least once a month for the past 10+ years and I never saw this coming. I talked to him on Tue and we chatted about old times, about Christmas and about my new job. Everything seemed fine, there was no indication, he made no statements that would worry me but obviously, there was something wrong.

So, why did I author the title the way I did, it's because when I went around our circle of friends one of the women said, and I quote ""I understand why women attempt and commit suicide because of all the shit we have to put up with, but why do men since they run everything in the world"", my answer ""Because of people just like you who actually believe that men are the ones in power when in actual fact that vast majority of men have zero power to control their own lives, That's why"".

Stupid Irish law,"In ireland, by law, a woman cannot rape, only a man can rape, and a man cannot be raped either. By law a man can only rape a woman, and if a woman was to rape a man, she will only be charged with sexual assault.

It's amazing how far things have gone in terms of women looking for any and every reason to shame and demonize anything a man does.  

Let's think logically about the act of sending someone roses.  This is something that takes some time, effort and money on your part to let someone else know that they are special to you.  You are not infringing upon their space and in most cases you are not even setting foot on their doorstep or going to their job as roses are often delivered.

Feminism is a major impediment to egalitarianism by trying to hijack all issues e.g. racial justice and turning it about feminism (post by selfdisciplinedlife). Toxic feminism #4 - hegemonic feminism.,"From user selfdisciplinedlife:

There is a serious problem in our society with hegemonic feminism wherein radical feminists attempt to dominate and control any and all discussions about equity and justice in order to impose a particular ‚Äúgynocentric‚Äù (sorry, I can‚Äôt think of any other term that fits) interpretation on those issues. Hence, the problem of violence in our society is transformed into a problem of ‚Äúviolence against women‚Äù, domestic abuse (most of which is against children) becomes domestic abuse against women, and even racism gets colonized by radical feminism to emphasize how it‚Äôs really a problem relating to ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù (in fact, the black rights/justice movement was effectively taken over by radical feminists). When that happens, practical, effective and FOCUSED solutions to solve or alleviate those problems (like expanding police training, gun control, community policing, better outreach programs for people at risk) are derailed in favour of unfocused fundamentalist approaches designed to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù the problem by first radically restructuring all of society (defund the police, end capitalism, etc). There isn‚Äôt a scrap of evidence that radically restructuring society would solve these problems- indeed, the objective evidence show's the opposite is much more likely to happen.

Humans have successfully solved complex problems with fixed, well defined and FOCUSED solutions. Those are the solutions that actually work. For example, consider the problem of unwanted pregnancies. Imagine if instead of introducing abortion and reproductive rights laws (a focused approach) we instead decided to restructure society so that there were no unwanted pregnancies because women wouldn‚Äôt get pregnant until they were happily married in a strong committed relationship. How many unwanted pregnancies would have been avoided in the last 30 years using that ‚Äúsocietal restructuring‚Äù approach? I imagine not one unwanted pregnancy would be avoided - in fact I suspect the problem would have been greatly increased.",36,0

What studies exist that legitimize claims that female under-representation is in part due to bias?,"I saw [this article](https://quillette.com/2020/07/27/the-myth-of-pervasive-misogyny/) posted on this subreddit the other day, and reading through the studies, I didn't want to get biased by availability. 

I had a former female friend (who has never been in the workforce and only in academia) tell me that there was a study that sent resumes to companies, holding all else the same except the gender. The result was that supposedly the resumes with male names were more likely to be hired in STEM. A study like this would absolutely show that women are biased against in careers. 

Now, I looked up on pubmed about gender biases and couldn't find anything of the sort. The studies that I could find that hold all else the same and only change gender demonstrate bias in women's favor. All the studies I could find purporting discrimination against women in hiring simply show discrepancy in hiring percentages or representation and the authors then attribute said discrepancy to bias. 

This seems to be pretty consistent across most articles I could find where women were shown to be discriminated against. The authors show that on average women receive proportionally less than men in something, like pay, representation, promotions, etc. after holding one or two variables consistent, like job or reported productivity, and then attribute said difference due to discrimination.

I came to my final conclusion of what to believe and what not,"Hello there, i like to start of by saying im happy ive done my research and ended up here.

Im a 15M and well im new to all this, but ive started thinking about it, ever since my philosophy teacher (a feminist) (M) started making anti-men and overall sexist remarks. I wanted to do my research so i searched and ended up here. And i like to thank this sub. This sub made me realize that: Feminism isnt always about equal rights, its (mostly) about empowering women, doesnt matter at what cost. Ever sincethe words of my philosophy teacher hit me, ive been thinking. Sure, women deserve rights just as much as we do. But feminist (most of the times) look down on us. For what reason i dunno. But coming into contact with a feminist has made me realize that. Every argument i brought up, he ended up shooting it down, or trying to make a comparison off, like he wanted to make a race

Per example: i told him: ''the most suicides are done by males''
And i found him reacting with ''well women also try commit suicide'' or ""the most attempts are done by females"". 

Safe to say it made me angry, people like this dont think we are concerned about the female deaths, what everyone is trying to say with the statment is that there is a lot of male deaths as well, when i bring up the argument i intend to make him recognize that male suicide is a serious thing, and we shouldnt make it a race or anything that comes close to death. What im getting at is: most mens rights arguments arent meant to shoot down females, but there to make people recognize that men do also have these problems

If mods take it down thats fine: maybe this was a vent (not in my eyes). But im just trying to give a story that subs like this help. They give new perspectives to an otherwise horrible argument. So thank you

APA guidelines for men sounds a lot less like guidelines to help men and a lot more like a guideline on how to train your dog.," 

&gt;When working with boys and men, psychologists can address issues of privilege and power related to sexism in a developmentally appropriate way to help them obtain the knowledge, attitudes, and skills to be effective allies and potentially live less restrictive lives. Male privilege tends to be invisible to men, yet they can become aware of it through a variety of means, such as education (Kilmartin, Addis, Mahalik, &amp; O‚ÄôNeil, 2013) and personal experience (O‚ÄôNeil, 2015; O‚ÄôNeil, Egan, Owen, &amp; Murry, 1993). Indeed, awareness of privilege and the harmful impacts of beliefs and behaviors that maintain patriarchal power have been shown to reduce sexist attitudes in men (Becker &amp; Swim, 2012) and have been linked to participation in social justice activities

Sounds a lot less like guidelines to help men and a lot more like a guideline on how to train your dog. The entire publication falters between saying #notall men and then continuing to insist that all men are liable to fall into some patriarchal domination complex where success cannot exist without sexism. It implies men are not thousands of patients with varying issues and self agency, but one patient under the presumption that masculinity is toxic.",23,0

I can't speek for all of but these are my thoughts on men's mental health.,"So I live in a very supportive family, my parents never told me not to cry or did anything to make me feel uncomfortable crying or telling people my emotions, they actually always stress how important it is. I still find it very uncomfortable crying openly. I think it's men's nature to not talk about feelings and emotions, not that it's good or that's what we should do.

Now am I saying don't take men's mental health seriously, I am just saying that I think most of us would still hide our emotions. I see way to many guys blaming women but in reality It's us.

The most cited male privilege checklist is bogus part 2,"This is part two of the response to the male privilege cheklist me and u/FinallyReborn saw on Instagram. Here's a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kfhvq2/the_most_cited_male_privilege_checklist_is_such/) to part 1 which was written by me.

&gt;I can be confident that my co-workers won‚Äôt think I got my job because of my sex - even though that might be true.‚Äù

We've been pushing the narrative that men are more likely to be hired in jobs than women are, they are paid more, they receive more feedback, girls are pushed away from certain jobs due to negative stereotypes and institutional hostility against them in science and yet people believe women are getting jobs because of their gender? That's why I called you hypocritical as you, like most people, especially those in academia and in the media, assume men are getting cookies for being male and the odds are skewed in their favor, but still claim people are unfairly saying to women they are the ones who are getting the upper hand. And really, would it be illogical of **some** people to perhaps question how some women get their positions when what we've been doing for the past few decades is demanding more and more female diversity in the workplace which has led to people like James Damore getting fired from their workplaces for daring to question it? For those of you who are unaware, James wrote his Google memo which was a review of the scientific literature on sex differences between men and women which suggests women are often driven away from STEM because of the preferences they have which are biologically based. The purpose of the memo was not to say no woman can experience hostility or discrimination - it was rather to call out the impractical approaches Google was employing, which are sometimes discriminatory, to increase diversity. James was fired for the sole purpose his memo was seen as ""misogynistic"" and an ""obstacle to female friendliness in the workplace"".

&gt;If I fail in my job or career, I can feel sure this won‚Äôt be seen as a mark against my entire sex‚Äôs personalities.

Women are assumed to be better at handling and caring for children, as men are often assumed to be [pedophiles](https://workinprogress.oowsection.org/2012/09/22/early-childhood-education-no-place-for-men/) when they care for children. It is safe to assume a man who is working in a female dominated field would feel pressure as he is breaking out of traditional male gender roles.

I find it hypocritical you are saying that when all of your work-related points operate on the basis that men are seen as more capable than women. Generally, that means a man who doesn‚Äôt live up to his expectations (of having to be capable and competent) will be ridiculed. That is seen in basically every form of society's look on men nowadays when men fail to live up to their expectations. Gay boys have around a [3x](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0162243911402363) higher suicide rate than lesbian women, and are [4x](https://archive.is/EMpR1) more likely to be a victim of a hate crime, why is that?

Your argument lacks nuance in its views on gender.

&gt;If I do the same task as a woman, and if the measurement is at all subjective, chances are people will think I did a better job.

Factually untrue. Women on average get more [positive feedback](https://psyarxiv.com/yq24b/) than men. Nuff said‚Äô.

&gt;I am not taught to fear walking alone after dark in average public spaces.

That is a type of female privilege, considering the fact that men are more likely to be a victim of every form of [hate-crime](https://archive.is/EMpR1), around [80%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1635092/) of homicide victims are men, men are over [2x](https://web.archive.org/web/20200629012832/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/vvcs9310.pdf) more likely to be victimized by a stranger, and around [90%](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bjs/104274.pdf) of men will be a victim of at least 1 violent crime.

Teaching women to be cautious is a privilege as it means people care when women are victimised, but not when men are and I really have to wonder who continues to perpetuate that fear. Lemme give you a hint - it starts with the word **f**. 

&gt;If I have children, nobody will think I'm selfish if I pursue a career.

If fathers don‚Äôt work full-time, and don‚Äôt provide a certain amount of money, they will be labelled ‚Äúdeadbeats‚Äù. Mothers who pursue a career are often glorified for ""defying the norm"".

&gt;Chances are my elected representatives are mostly people of my own sex. The more prestigious and powerful the elected position, the more likely this is to be true.

Chances also are that the person sleeping on the sidewalk you passed by today is also a man, but that‚Äôs irrelevant to you because such men are invisible to women and most of society.

The elected 2020 Vice President is officially a woman and Joe Biden has created an all-female team for the sake of diversity. There are quotas on corporate boards for women in many countries as well as quotas for women in politics, so the narrative is changing in favour of women. 

&gt;As a child, chances are I was encouraged to be more active and outgoing than my sisters.

Probably true. However such encouragement can turn into an active expectation wherein boys who are more introverted are pressured to be active and outgoing and if they aren't, they can be shamed for being lazy, unproductive, feminine, etc...

&gt;I can turn on the television or glance at the front page of the newspaper and see people from my own sex widely represented, every day, without exception.

A [study](https://archive.is/NHC61) made by Jim Macnamara that looked at over 2,000 media segments, found that around 69% of men‚Äôs portrayal in the media was negative, 19% was moderate, and only 12% was positive.

""Men were predominantly reported or portrayed in mass media as villains, aggressors, perverts, and philanderers, with more than 75 percent of all mass media representations of men and male identity showing men in one of these four ways,"" Dr. Macnamara says.

Victimized women also get [3x](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7586&amp;context=jclc) more media representation than men.

Such negative representation of men in the media is bad for boys regardless of its quantity.

‚ÄúHighly negative views of men and male identity provide little by way of positive role models for boys to find out what it means to be a man and gives boys little basis for self-esteem.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the current environment where there is an identified lack of positive male role models in the physical world through the absentee of fathers in many families and a shortage of male teachers, the lack of positive role models in the media and presence of overwhelmingly negative images should be of concern.‚Äù

&gt;If I‚Äôm careless with my driving, it won‚Äôt be attributed to my sex.

Women on average are worse drivers than men whether you care to admit it or not. In a [study](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2012188/Women-drivers-ARE-dangerous-wheel-scientists-discover.html) that took place over a 9 year period, women were involved in nearly [70%](https://cars.lovetoknow.com/about-cars/how-many-miles-do-americans-drive-per-year) of total car crashes, despite men on average driving 40% more miles per year.

The same can also be said about men and abuse/rape. Rape is viewed as a male perpetrated crime, so is abuse and feminists often like to attribute such toxic behavior to men as a group (e.g Susan Brownmiller).

&gt;If I have sex with a lot of people, it won't make me an object of contempt or derision.

Men are called ‚Äúfuckboys"". Incel and virgin shaming tactics also exist and they are primarily targered at men. Calling a woman a slut, or a hoe is socially unacceptable. Calling men an incel, virgin, fuckboy isn't. In fact, incel shaming is more often encouraged than discouraged.

&gt;My wardrobe and grooming are relatively cheap and consume little time.

Men's and women‚Äôs clothing is similar in [price](https://gulfnews.com/lifestyle/fashion/clothing-prices-which-gender-has-it-more-expensive-1.60001260), but women's clothing tends to have more complicated designs and there is a higher selection of women‚Äôs clothes than men‚Äôs, so it is logical to expect that women‚Äôs clothing would be more expensive in general.

&gt;I can be confident that the ordinary language of day-to-day existence will always include my sex. ‚ÄúAll men are created equal,‚Äù mailman, chairman, freshman, he.

That also includes words like gunman, knifeman, manspreading, mansplaining, etc... The phrase ""all men are created equal"" means all people are created equal as the word man meant person and people generally understood it that way. Look at feminists not understanding language...

&gt;I will never be expected to change my name upon marriage or questioned if I don‚Äôt change my name.

The only people that will actually question you are your average 70-year-old republicans Joe and Mary and even they might not do it - 99% of us won't care. Women hold most of the cards in marriage, but oh are they oppressed when somebody, slightly more traditional, questions their name...

&gt;Most major religions in the world is led primarily by people of my own sex. Even god, In most major religions, is usually pictured as being male.

Do you know who else is pictured as being male in most major religions? The Devil. Most religious people are [women](https://www.ncls.org.au/news/women-more-religious). This doesn‚Äôt seem to be an issue for them. Why is it one for you?

&gt;If I have a wife or live-in girlfriend, chances are we‚Äôll divide up household chores so that she does most of the labor and in particular the most repetitive and unrewarding tasks.

Let me rephrase this point too, ‚ÄúIf I have a wife or live-in girlfriend, chances are we‚Äôll divide up household chores so we do an equal amount of labor, in proportion to the amount of work we do‚Äù.

Accounting for all [labor](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/), men spend a total of 63 hours per week, compared to the 57 hours women spend. It is easier to argue that men are doing too many household chores in proportion to the number of hours they do in every other form of labor.

&gt;If I have children with a wife or girlfriend, and it turns out that one of us needs to make career sacrifices to raise the kids, chances are we‚Äôll both assume the career sacrificed should be hers.

Yeah, because in the majority of households it‚Äôs the man who is expected to pull in the primary paycheck, so it would be logical that the parent who is pulling in the least amount of money should be the one to sacrifice their work, in the majority of cases, that person is a woman.

&gt;On average, I am under less pressure to be thin than my female counterparts are. If I am fat, I probably suffer fewer social and economic consequences than my female counterpart does.

Publicly making fun of an overweight woman is socially unacceptable, it isn‚Äôt for men. According to this [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.22162), 40% of men experience weight discrimination. Body dysmorphia in [men](https://themeadowglade.com/what-body-dysmorphia-looks-like-in-men/) is just as common as it is in women. But what about height discrimination? [Employers](https://www.baylor.edu/mediacommunications/index.php?id=18402) are 72% more likely to employ the taller man, even when the shorter man has similar, or slightly better backgrounds and skills. Men get on average $600 more per year in salary in each increased inch in height.

Difference here is, weight is controllable in most cases whereas height is mostly genetic.

&gt;Complete strangers generally do not walk up to me and tell me to ‚Äúsmile‚Äù.

This has happened to me, a male, dozens of times. Complete strangers generally do not walk up to you and rob you, beat you, kill you which are crimes men are more likely to experience, but of course, complain about being asked to smile, which isn‚Äôt even a gendered issue, nor an ‚Äúissue‚Äù.",6,0
The post cited male privilege checklist is bogus part 2,[deleted],0,0
The most cited male privilege checklist is such bogus,"
I was scrolling through Instagram and I stumbled across a [male privilege checklist ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIQbKpxL5Lh/?igshid=kd8rnp3y2yr4) most of you are probably aware of. However, me and a friend of mine (u/FinallyReborn) still wanted to cover its points here. I will segregate the post into two sections (part I which will be addressed by me and [part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kfjbpx/the_most_cited_male_privilege_checklist_is_bogus/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) which is addressed by him). Also, the points are not in order, but I don't think that matters. What matters are the points themselves. 

# Part I

&gt;My odds of being hired for a job, when competing against female applicants, are probably skewed in my favor. The more prestigious the job, the larger the odds are skewed.

How do I begin to unpack this? 
- STEM favours women in a ratio of [2:1](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360)
- Blind hiring (that is the gender of the applicant is not known) favours men whereas non-blind recruitment [favours women by a couple percentage points ](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-30/bilnd-recruitment-trial-to-improve-gender-equality-failing-study/8664888).
- Men, on average, are more likely to be discriminated against when job hunting, which includes [both male and female dominated jobs ](https://www.amhf.org.au/national_health_strategy_great_news_for_men).
- [This 2019 study ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537119300429#bib0013) also found discrimination against men in hiring. 
- [This ](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/rabble-rouser/201906/are-scientists-biased-against-women-scientists-part-i) and [this](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/rabble-rouser/201906/are-scientists-biased-against-women-scientists-part-ii) article on discrimination against women in science which examine more than hiring, find either no bias against women or more anti-male than anti-female bias in science. 

The idea men won't face discrimination in hiring and the odds are skewed in their favour especially in prestigious fields like STEM is false. The narrative stems from gender stereotypes such as female vulnerability that expects women to always be the recipients of discriminaton or injustice which itself is a type of bias against men.

&gt;If I am never promoted, it's not because of my sex.

That's supported by? Most of the claims which are made in this checklist are either baseless or outright false and one-sided. (see above)

&gt;I am far less likely to face sexual harassment at work than are my female co-workers.

Perhaps, it is true ""men are less likely to face sexual harassment"" in the workplace, though I am skeptical of the word ""far"". [Men represent 1 in 5 complaints of sexual harassment in the workplace in the US ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/men-account-for-nearly-1-in-5-complaints-of-workplace-sexual-harassment-with-the-eeoc/2018/04/08/4f7a2572-3372-11e8-94fa-32d48460b955_story.html#click=https://t.co/qlAIX7lYzh) and the number could be heavily under-counted as men often under-report their abuse ([here](https://archive.is/idxmc#selection-1853.0-1863.28) and [here](https://archive.is/Wn1ev)). [Attitudes ](https://archive.is/s7UOk#selection-139.466-139.889) like this exist: ""If a woman pats a man‚Äôs butt, admiringly asks whether he‚Äôs been working out, and suggestively compliments him on how good he looks, people chuckle. If the roles were reversed, those same people would be outraged (and rightfully so)"". It could also be that men are less likely to be taken seriously and [women are less likely to be viewed as perpetrators](https://archive.fo/JaI4J#selection-1111.0-1114.0): 
""In the¬†Horizon Oil Sands work camp in Alberta, men who are caught in women‚Äôs dorms are fired on the spot, while women are allowed in the men‚Äôs dorm rooms."" 

Harassment in general is reported to be proportionally equal for both sexes. [This study ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233447134_Bullying_at_work_Epidemiological_findings_in_public_and_private_organizations) looked at bullying at work and found that ""men and women did not differ in prevalence"". [Another study ](https://bit.ly/3qMdYHt) looked at workplace bullying and found ""no significant differences in the bullying experiences of men and women"". [A study in Sweden ](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13594329608414853) looked at the prevalence of mobbing in the workplace which is defined as ""harassing, ganging up on someone, or psychologically terrorising others at work"" and found ""men (45%) and women (55%) are subjected [to workplace mobbing] in roughly equal proportions, the difference not being significant"". [A report by StatsCan ](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2018001/article/54982-eng.htm) found that ""19% of women and 13% of men experienced workplace harassment in the past year"". 

&gt;If I'm a teen or adult, and if I stay out of prison, my odds of being raped are so low as to be negligible.

False. The odds of men being raped outside of prison (which is obviously excluded to prove a point) are not low or negligible (once you start to look at rape in a more nuanced manner and expand the definition of rape to be inclusive of victims who weren't penetrated and were instead forced to penetrate their perpetrators, the narrative crumbles apart). I also love how they say ""if I stay out of prison"" as if men simply choose to be in prison and there is no bias in sentencing and men's criminal behaviour is not a product of environmental causes like fatherlessness [which is not true ](https://becauseits2015.wordpress.com/2017/01/29/justice-system-discrimination-and-the-myth-that-sexism-against-men-isnt-institutional/). To get back to the ""the rape of men outside of prison which we will conveniently exclude because reasons is low to the point of being negligible"" claim, the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey would like to disagree:
- [The NISVS (2010)](https://bit.ly/2DTxNsE) showed that during the proceeding 12 months of the survey, 1.1% of men were made to penetrate and 1.1% of women were raped. Table 2.1 and 2.2 pages 18-19.
- [The NISVS (2011)](https://bit.ly/32tSiWb) showed that in the past 12 months of the survey, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.0% of women were raped. Table 1, page 5.
- [The NISVS (2012)](https://bit.ly/2RIrKjM) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.2% of women were raped. Table A.1 and A.5 on pages 217 and 222.
- [The NISVS (2015)](https://bit.ly/3irgz4S) showed that in the past 12 months, 0.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.2% of women were raped.

Just as a side note: we say made to penetrate instead of rape as the CDC does not consider made to penetrate to be rape and instead puts it in the category of sexual assault which leads to media under-reporting of the problem of the rape of men. The idea that the rape of men outside of prison is low or negligible is another myth that is rooted in gender norms which are again more advantageous to women as their victimisation is universally recognised whereas men's victimisation is swept under the rug. In case anybody brings up the fact that I am only quoting annual data and not lifetime data which found a high prevalence of male victimisation once made to penetrate is lumped in the same category as rape, I am doing that because lifetime data has less accuracy as it runs into more problems such as memory loss, confusion of events, how well one interpreted their victimisation which might have taken place long ago, etc... [This source notes:](https://bit.ly/3hmTpLH) ""Research tells us that 20% of critical details are irretrievable after one year of their occurance and 50% are irretrievable after 5 years"". This could heavily skew the data in favour of women as they are less likely to internalise their victimisation and more likely to report.

&gt;If I choose not to have children, my masculinity will not be called into question.

Incorrect. [Here](http://imgur.com/gallery/uBlqRTu) and [here](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/251005379202625072/). 

&gt;If I have children and provide primary care for them, I'll be praised for extraordinary parenting even if I'm marginally competent.

Assuming that's true (for the sake of argument), it is only half of the story - that is while there are fathers, single or married, who are praised for doing ""mommy's work"", often for a valid reason, there are also fathers who encounter day-to-day stereotypes and hardships for not living up to their traditional role of a provider. For instance, [this survey ](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/03/23/gender-and-caregiving/#many-say-mothers-do-a-better-job-caring-for-a-new-baby-than-fathers-but-about-seven-in-ten-say-its-equally-important-for-babies-to-bond-with-both) found mothers are seen as better caregivers and fathers are more likely to be pressured to work more and be financially liable for their families. We can reason that if that's the case, then a man who breaks out of his gender role and takes on a ""mother's job"" will be seen as a deviant and often encounter negative stereotypes about his gender and his abilities will be put to question. [This video interview (skip to 6:14) as the actual video has been made private ](https://youtu.be/DjCuEUftz4w) describes motherhood which it synonymously links to parenthood as the ""hardest job"". Additionally, anybody who has spent some time on social media platforms such as Twitter can notice a pattern of people including [verified accounts ](https://mobile.twitter.com/torylanez/status/1274768830980599808) turning Father's Day into a day about single mothers or mothers in general. Therefore, it is quite absurd to say that a father who is marginally competent as a caregiver will receive extraordinary praise as opposed to a mother who does the same job better. 

&gt;If I seek political office, my relationship with my children, or who I hire to care for them, will probably not be scrutinised by the press. 

Unless, of course you're Donald Trump in which case everything you do will be examined by the media and used against you. [This article ](https://www.thelist.com/263027/the-truth-about-donald-trumps-relationship-with-his-son-barron/) analyses Donald Trump's realationship with his son, Barron Trump and [this article ](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/05/donald-trump-kids-normal/amp) goes on to examine how Trump's children grew up ""relatively normal"" as well as who took care of them, etc, etc.... 

&gt;I can be somewhat sure that if I ask to see ""the person in charge"", I will face a person of my own sex. The higher-up in the organization the person, the surer I can be. 

That benefits me, how? As a woman, if you go outside, the odds are the overwhelming majority of people at the bottom you will see such as construction workers, or the unsheltered homeless, will be men. 

&gt;As a child, I could choose from an almost infinite variety of children's media featuring positive, active, non-stereotyped heroes of my own sex. I never had to look for it; male protagonists were (are) the default. 

As a child, I saw myself represented as an antagonist in almost every cartoon or TV show. The servants of each villain who were killed one after another like a disposable pile of garbage were also universally male. Such ""servants"" continue to be almost universally male as people prefer men dying in movies to women dying or being tortured. The ""default protagonist"" is not male either (Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Supergirl). The existence of male protagonists in most movies especially romantic ones encouraged boys to turn into risk taking or self-sacrificing men who leave their well-being behind to protect people especially women and children. 

&gt;If my day, week or year is going badly, I need not ask of each negative episode or situation whether it has sexist overtons.

Privilege is not defined or measured by one's inability to recognise whether somebody was sexist to them or not because of how normalised society's inability to spot misandry is. Privilege is having society pander to you and your issues to the point where you become paranoid and question everything or everybody for potentially being misogynistic to you and always blaming others for your misery because of how little accountability you are expected to take for your own problems. It is not ""women caused their own issues"", it is almost always ""society or HE caused these issues"" meanwhile for men it is almost always ""he caused his own issues"" or ""other men caused his issues"". 

&gt;If I am careless with my financial affairs, it won't be attributed to my sex.

As a woman, if I am incapable of earning enough money or a high income, that won't be blamed on my sex's inability to provide. 

&gt;I can speak to a large group of people without putting my sex on trial.

So can women. In fact, [women can freely talk about raping men on a stage that is supposed to be empowering to women and treat it like a joke](https://www.instagram.com/p/CH-mgQzgj5a/?igshid=18k1s81yex8ou)

&gt;There are value-neutral clothing choices available to me. It is possible for me to choose clothing that doesn't send any particular message to the world.

So it is for women. Women can also wear their boyfriends' casual clothing and still be seen as cute. A man wearing a dress or his girlfriend's clothing is enough for him to be called a ""beta male emasculated cuck"" by prominent political figures such as [Candace Owens ](https://romanshcheezit.medium.com/no-conservatives-dont-care-about-men-95d25513e678) or even beaten up in more traditional countries whereas women can wear traditionally masculine clothing such as suits and nobody bats an eye. Men are also expected to wear clothing and accessories which signify status to the world (expensive watches, ties, suits). 

&gt;If I am not conventionally attractive, the disadvantages are small and easy to ignore.

Not if you are short and skinny. Employment opportunities decline, so do dating opportunities (I wouldn't consider that to be ""easy to ignore"").

&gt;I can ask for legal protection from violence that happens mostly to men without being seen as a selfish special interest, since that kind of violence is called ""crime"" and is a general social concern. (Violence that happens mostly to women is usually called ""domestic violence"" or ""acquaintance rape"", and is seen as a special interest issue.)

This one is so detached from any observable reality that you can lose brain cells just reading it. Crime that happens to men is not seen as a special social concern (domestic violence and rape are both called crimes, if not some of the worst crimes one can do to another - ""rape is so vile that only murder is worse"". If they are listed out as separate issues, that is because they are viewed as separate, more concerning crimes which we should pay more attention to), or at least not because it happens to men (the crime which is gendered against men is homicide, 77-80% male, so it might sometimes make sense to prioritise it, say, over intimate partner violence which is also 40-50% male, check out the NISVS). However, violence against men is not seen as a ""special concern"" - violence against women by men is seen as a special concern. You will rarely see campaigns saying ""end violence against men"", ""teach women not to be violent"", but almost all of such gendered campaigns are gendered to favour women. Domestic violence and the rape of women are put at the front of political discourse to the point where universities [deny male students their due process rights ](https://archive.vn/649JL) when they are accused of rape. Women are systemically favoured in both [police intervention ](https://archive.is/M5N5v) and [services ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175099/) for victims of domestic abuse. The overwhelming majority of services are for women and the overwhelming majority of batterer programs are for men, that is in spite of the consensus in family violence research being that women commit intimate partner violence equally, if not more (once you account for unilateral violence which is mostly done by women and lesbian on lesbian violence which tops heterosexual violence and gay male violence). In some other countries like India or Spain, male victims have even fewer legal protections from partner abuse which in Spain is labelled ""[gendered violence (the blog is in Spanish so use a translator to understand it if you are not Spanish) ](https://diferenciaslegaleshombremujerenespana.law.blog)"". The idea male victimisation is a ""special concern"" and that's a privilege is laughable and not in touch with reality. In reality, violence against men is and [has been ](https://youtu.be/JHkGZvC0z4I) minimised, dismissed or excused, especially when it takes the form of genital mutilation where boys are mutilated in the states, their foreskins are sold for profit and they have no explicit protections from the practice meanwhile FGM is seen as a separate, special kind of violence in 39 states. Men wanting more services when they have less even though they should have more are called misogynists who are stealing resources from women and researchers or activists who discover or say that DV is symmetrical are blacklisted (e.g, Straus, Pizzey, [Silverman who ended up killing himself after he opened up the FIRST male only shelter in Canada and was bullied to death by the government which denied him assistance as ""male victimisation is not sufficient enough to warrant the amount of protection and funding he needed""](https://youtu.be/Yt5BRcsOyy0), [see this as well](https://archive.is/3tqdV). The overwhelming majority of moral and psychological experiments also show violence against women is viewed as a more despicable and morally reprehensible phenomenon than violence against men (see [here](https://greenpill.net/male-disposability-the-evidence/)). So, yes, men are called ""selfish"" even though they are less protected from violence both legally and culturally. Who isn't? Those who demand more and more protection for women even at the expense of men and then call that male privilege when male victims are treated like second-class citizens not worthy of equal protection to assist them in times of need. 

&gt;My ability to make important decisions and my capability in general will never be questioned depending on what time of the month it is. 

My inability to take risks, be competent, make life or death decisions and be emotionally stable will be challenged more than a woman's regardless of what time of the month it is. 

&gt;The decision to hire me will never be based on assumptions about whether or not I might choose to have a family sometime soon.

The capacity of a man to provide for his wife and children or his future family can be taken into account in some hiring practices. 

&gt;Most major religions argue that I should be the head of my household, while my wife and children should be subservient to me. 

Feminists and their cherry-picking abilities. ""Husbands love your wives the way Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her (King James Bible)"", ""Husbands should love their wives the way Christ loved the church and gave his life for it"" (Contemporary English version). [Source ](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm). Yes, the Bible and other religions alike did tell women to be submissive to their husbands, but they also expected mutual and similar obligations of husbands. (the Bible being one example). Also, the term ""the head of the household"" is another word for a wage slave - as being the head of the household entails having to be fully financially liable for the support of your family. In some countries like Japan, women and men often take on traditional gender roles, but the [wife usually controls most of the budget while her husband is left with pocket money in spite of working more ](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19674306).

&gt;If I have children with a wife or girlfriend, chances are she'll do most of the childrearing, and in particular the most dirty, repetitive and unrewarding parts of childrearing.

[Historically and presently ](https://greenpill.net/marriage-as-economic-slavery/) men were and are pushed away from childrearing (in marriage and post-marriage due to custody problems). Women, on the other hand, are given a flexible option and the source shows the overwhelming majority of women choose and prefer flexibility to work life, so they end up doing more childcare and housework. In many countries, men struggle to get access to paternity leave and can't take on the caregiver role which is traditionally associated with women because they are expected to work. Feminists, as per usual, only give us half of the story which in fact shows women have more flexibility than men.

&gt;Magazines, billboards, television, movies, pornography, and virtually all of media is filled with imagines of scantily-clad women intended to appeal to me sexually. Such imagines of men exist, but are much rarer.

Of course that also ignores how often men are depicted as [deadbeats, irresponsible, clumsy, easily controlled, macho, incapable of being a decent parent, etc... ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/11/14/are-men-the-latest-victims-of-media-misrepresentation/?sh=32f72feb2caf) by many TV shows and commercials alike or how often the media [plays the sexual assault of men especially in prison and the sexual assault of men by women for laughs ](https://youtu.be/uc6QxD2_yQw). [This is a follow up video ](https://youtu.be/9nheskbsU5g). 

""But oh, well, we will only show you how attractive women are displayed on billboards to get men's dicks hard so companies can profit.""

&gt;If I am heterosexual, it's incredibly unlikely that I'll ever be beaten up by a spouse or lover.

Wrong, wrong. Just so wrong. 
- [This study ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407590073005) found women inflict severe violence on their partners more than men and men are more likely to sustain severe abuse. 
- [This study ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14113430_Gender_Differences_in_Partner_Violence_in_a_Birth_Cohort_of_21-Year-Olds_Bridging_the_Gap_Between_Clinical_and_Epidemiological_Approaches) found women are more likely to inflict severe violence on their partners than men are and men are more likely to sustain violent abuse. However, women reported being beaten up more (2.4% of women compared to 1.4% of men) than their male counterparts - men were much more likely to be kicked/bitten/hit with fists or an object and threatened with a knife/gun. They were also just as likely to experience the use of a knife/gun. 
- [The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey ](https://web.archive.org/web/20201017163043/http://www.batteredmen.com/) found that over 40% of victims of severe psychological and physical violence which includes being punched, kicked, etc... are men. 
- These studies and reviews ([here](https://bit.ly/3777wA6) and [here](https://bit.ly/34YT7V2)) find no evidence that women abuse in retaliation or self-defense or that women are less likely to strike the first blow/more likely to exercise violence in self-defense than men are. In fact, this [survey](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/in_brief_domestic_violence_not_always_one_sided) found 70% of one-sided abuse is committed by women and the majority of intimate partner violence is bilateral (committed by both partners) with women hitting first more often. This [blog post ](https://linearthinker.wordpress.com/2010/10/26/weighing-in-on-the-domestic-violence-debate-a-response-to-david-manboobz-futrelle/) responds to feminist claims on domestic abuse and criticism of the CTS scale. The claim that men are rarely abused by their partners and women are innocent victims who rarely commit intimate partner violence (just like the claim that men outside of prison are rarely raped and men are not discriminated against in hiring) comes from gender stereotypes which put women in a vulnerable position to men and such gender stereotypes are inherently advantageous to women as they lead to female victims of violence being believed and or taken seriously more often than male victims. 

&gt;On average, I am not interrupted by women as often as women are interrupted by men.

That darling oppression - being interrupted or letting others interrupt you due to your agreeableness and incapability of displaying dominance or assertiveness. Poor women. Here's an actual undeserved privilege: as a woman, your opinions will be rarely dismissed and called ""womansplaining"" purely because you are a woman. As a woman, you won't be accused of ""womanterrupting"" when you interrupt another woman or man while men will be accused of both, sometimes on [TV or in official settings ](https://youtu.be/TJyQpRfaGnw). 


&gt;As a child, chances are I got more teacher attention than girls who raised their hand just as often.

This ""male privilege"" is addressed in the book [The War Against Boys ](http://library.lol/main/859CC63453C4C0E6C7E7F2FF725972A2). Even if what was said is true, it's not necessarily evidence of actual discriminaton against girls as it could be caused by a multitude of factors including the fact that girls outperform boys, are the majority of A students, get better grades on average, are more likely to attend higher education and are less likely to be subjected to punishment for their behavior, so naturally when a boy raises his hand, teachers might be inclined to pick him instead because he rarely gets the chance to talk or show his skills. The idea of ""male privilege"" in the classroom is laughable, almost as laughable as saying violence against women is taken less seriously than violence against men (which is what you did not so long ago) once one looks at the stats on who is getting the upper hand and overacheiving. Before somebody stops me and says ""but that outcome is a consequence of girls working harder than boys"", well no, it isn't. Boys and girls actually get identical grades, if not boys outperform girls on subjects traditionally associated with masculinity such as mathematics and science, but are systemically downgraded on teacher assessments which causes them to underperform and be discouraged from competing alongside girls. Teacher bias is a strong predictor for the disparities in achievement between the sexes ([here](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/496867), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775713000782), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775718307714?via%3Dihub), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272708000418?via%3Dihub), [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2019.1646862?journalCode=rael20), [here](https://www.ipp.eu/en/news/a-helping-hand-for-girls-gender-bias-in-marks-and-its-effect-on-student-progress/), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775716304526?via%3Dihub) and [here](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0036620)). [92% of sex-selective scholarships are reserved for women, too ](https://www.thecollegefix.com/92-percent-of-sex-specific-scholarships-are-reserved-for-women-study-finds/) and the [system sides with female complaints of discrimination more than it does with male complaints](https://archive.vn/649JL) in almost every sector - from grading discrimination to the denial of due process rights to accused men. Some schools admit to gender bias such as [this one ](http://imgur.com/a/hVc8sf4). Additionally, [this study  ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230871109_Investing_in_Children_Changes_in_Parental_Spending_on_Children_1972-2007) which analysed economic spending on children's education by parents from 1972 to 2007 found that parents spend more on girls' education than boys' education and [this article ](https://archive.is/Q6LoP) explores the relationship between gender stereotypes and the suppression of boy behavior which is deemed to be aggressive in schools. Could disruptive behavior explain part of the disparity in achievement? Yes, but it doesn't dispute the existence of bias either. It is rather simplistic to look at disruptive behavior as ""boys doing it to themselves"" when such behavior can be caused by factors which are outside of boys' control such as [family breakdowns](https://archive.is/cOUxS) as well as single parenthood and the lack of a father figure at home which might impact boys differently than girls. [This 2008 report from HRW ](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2008/us0808/8.htm) also found that in places where corporal punishment is still practiced or was practiced, boys were subject to punishment disproportionately to girls and while it would be irrational to attribute all of the disparity to bias, it would be no surprise if bias played a role in it. The article notes: ""One high school teacher suggested one possible reason for the gender disparity in paddling, noting that at her school it was common practice to ‚Äústay away from hitting the girls. I guess they‚Äôre more fragile, and a lot of them could be pregnant and we wouldn‚Äôt know it.‚Äù A father of two boys and a girl felt that it was more acceptable for boys to be paddled than girls. He explained, ‚ÄúMy little girl‚Äîdon‚Äôt you put your hands on her‚Ä¶. As far as my boys, I am super hard on them. For one, they are young black men and they are faced with different obstacles in life. I get on them every day, and I know they say, ‚ÄòMan, my dad is tough."" Many interviewees reported that boys were beaten more harshly than girls. A middle school boy in Mississippi observed that one of his teachers ‚Äúpaddle the boys real hard and when he paddled the girls he don‚Äôt really hit them.‚Äù One student reported that there are smaller paddles for girls: ‚ÄúThey use a short one for girls and a long one for the boys.""¬†

I don't like it when male circumcision is compared to female genital mutilation,"I'm circumcised, and I'm very much against male circumcision, but female genital mutilation is a lot worse than male circumcision is, and so they are not the same thing.

For example, most male circumcisions are done in hospitals or sterile environment with clean medical cutting tools, while most female genital mutilations are done out in the open with dirty non-medical cutting tools (like hunting knives or sometimes a piece of glass even).

Also, female genital mutilation usually takes away most sexual pleasure from a woman, while men can still feel a lot of sexual pleasure after a circumcision. Most of the clitoris (or at least a lot of it) is removed from female genital mutilation, while only the foreskin is removed from a male circumcision. The equivalent to removing the whole clitoris in males would be removing the whole glans of the penis, and the equivalent to removing the foreskin in females would be the clitoral hood.

I read somewhere that male circumcision isn't near as damaging as even the less extreme forms of female genital mutilation is. I'm not sure if that's true or not. ",74,0

How can I approach this issue in dating?","I took a break from dating for a span of 2 years to focus on my career, my life, and other things important to me, and generally stayed away from political matters despite living in a very progressive area of America. 

Two years ago, I don't remember ever having a conversation about women's rights, feminism, the pay gap, or anything to do with how women have it ""harder"" than men with any of the women I was dating. But now, as I'm reconnecting with female ""friends"" and going on dates with women more and more, I keep hearing them bring up women's issues. **Did something change? What happened? Is it because I'm now in my mid/late 20s? Is it because it's primarily online dating?**

--------

As for my opinions on this, I find it wildly inappropriate to bring up politics on dates, and even more so, to bring up politics that is centered around telling someone how privileged a group that they were born into is and how they comparably have it far easier. I would never tell a woman how much easier they have it in regard to homelessness, prison rates, prison sentencing, suicides, child support, alimony, domestic abuse support, dating, sex, etc. because that's not only rude but also unproductive to the goal of dating. I want to focus on areas that I can control and act as a good person, rather than complain to others about things that are not wholly in my control. Yet, almost complete strangers have no qualms with bringing up issues to me in regards to my gender. 

I'm worried because something I never noticed before is now so pervasive in my experience of the dating market. A few years ago, I never noticed any of the women I was dating to ever bring up gender issues, and, now, a whole lot of them bring it up either subliminally or directly. **How can I expect all these individuals that believe that women have it so much harder to ever contribute as equally to my growth and development in a relationship as I will to theirs?**

-----

Frankly, the more and more I hear from women about the ""hardships"" women exclusively face, the more and more biased I become against those viewpoints, especially given that any conversation regarding the validity of certain viewpoints usually ends in emotional tantrums. Right now, I know this is bad, but when I hear someone talk about women having more problems in certain areas, I feel like I'm listening to a spoiled kid complaining how a ""make-a-wish"" kid they know gets to see their favorite celebrity. 

I definitely realize I'm hitting a point where I'm totally unreceptive and apathetic towards any feminist/women's issue. **Is there any place where I can have a genuine, non-emotional conversation with women on their issues?** I'd like to be more open than I am currently, but a lot of the points I hear are either false or steeped in emotional backdrop.

"The earliest identified occupational cancer affected the testicles of prepubescent boy chimney sweeps in Victorian era England. They lived short, terrible lives and rarely reached adulthood.","One thing I haven't seen discussed very much is the long history of boys being used for some truly terrible jobs throughout history.

One of those jobs was the chimney sweep.  They used young boys because they were both small enough to go inside chimneys and because they were disposable enough to be made to do it.

Not only was this a terrible job to perform, but the earliest example of an occupational cancer was identified in chimney sweepers. The cancer affected their testicles and started out as a sore on the outside of the scrotum known as ""soot wart"". A combination of cancer, lung diseases, and other medical problems meant that most never lived to be 18, or were disabled before they became adults.

The phrase *""to light a fire under someone""* originated from this practice.  If the chimney sweeper was taking too long, they would start a fire in the fireplace to make him work faster.

It was also common for them to get stuck or lost in chimney mazes. Chimneys used to have branches between different buildings that were difficult to navigate. And they would let the boys die from dehydration or asphyxiation before they would destroy the chimney to get them out.

There was such a high demand for boy chimney sweepers that families would sell their sons into what was essentially slavery for extra cash.

In India they still use boys to mine certain shafts that are too small for adults to fit in.

The term delivery boy (and it's negative connotation) likely shares a common heritage with other ""boy occupations"" that we forced boys to do.

Child labor laws were originally implemented because people became appalled at the working and living conditions of chimney sweeps (who often walked around in soot covered rags because that's all they were given to wear).  Those laws largely went ignored for hundreds of years though because enforcement was sparse.

Even today, these jobs tend to be performed by men. Conditions, and pay, are obviously better. But many traditional male occupations are looked down on as ""lower class"" even if the pay is comparatively better to the more comfortable jobs that women perform.  It's ""men's work"" which somehow makes it lower in prestige, and less desirable, than ""women's work"".

Here's a short video about chimney sweepers and a couple Wikipedia articles:

What's the deal with that one website?,"Hi all. Had to word the title that way because of reddit. I wanted to stop by and ask about [mgtow.com](https://mgtow.com). I would've asked on the mgtow reddit, but of course reddit has banned that sub. Naturally this place is a logical second choice. 

Did it get bought out by the femminist corporate overlords that we're at war with? You can't sign up on their forums, and I keep reading things like ""Nothing ever came of [mgtow.com](https://mgtow.com)"" and ""[Mgtow.com](https://Mgtow.com) is basically dead"".

Is this the case? Is there anything actually wrong with that site? Or is it functioning normally, and maybe it's just ran by incompetent people? If there is a real problem, I might be interested in starting up some variant of it and marketing it properly, about a year from now. It would of course need to make money, but the real reason I'd want to do it, would be so that I could funnel money to men's rights causes. I'm interested in so many of them, but one of them might be campaign contributions to friendly politicians. 

The site could be a means of raising/earning money towards that end. If anyone is unfamiliar with the idea, the quick and dirty is this: You find a politician known to be sympathetic to a particular men's rights issue or cause. You say that you'd be interested in making a campaign contribution in the amount of x, but you'd first like to know how they're going to vote on the upcoming issue of x. They want the money, and they'll pledge to vote your way. They know they're expected to. And they might not have otherwise, having perhaps some other incentive not to, even though they are sympathetic to the cause. But now they've been paid. Yeah it's messed up but that's how our system works. And it's what our opposition does constantly, so we'd better do it to if we hope to accomplish any of our goes and effect real social and legal change. 

So it would be very helpful to me if someone could tell me what's really going on with the website [Mgtow.com](https://Mgtow.com). Thanks!

Men hitting women,"&amp;#x200B;

So I thought about why men can't hit women and the reason is obviously that on average males pose such a huge physical advantage over women that hitting them is completely unfair which makes sense however I'm fairly average size and strength so someone like DK Metcalf or Lebron James would hold the same physical advantage over me the same way I do over women (on average)

So here's the scenario if I ran into a woman who threw water on me spat on me threw food in my face and violated and disrespected me if I was to hit her I would be criticized however if I did the same thing to DK Metcalf in a bar and he fucked me up there would be no issue people would say ""I had it coming!""

What I mean is how this fair, she gets to be disrespectful and nothing happens but if did it I would be on the ground getting violated.

Quick rant,"Had a conversation with a female best friend earlier this week. We saw a news report about a woman who got sexually assaulted down in Florida (terrible what happened to her). I said to her that this type of stuff should never happen to a man or a woman. She says ‚Äúmen don‚Äôt get sexually assaulted, they normally like it when they touch them.‚Äù (She‚Äôs for equality btw).  I said ‚Äúreally? If a guy came up to you, grabbed your bits, and told you you knew you liked it, even though you told them to get off, would it not count as sexual assault?‚Äù

She then says to me ‚Äúyeah it would! A man should never put his hands on a woman! Especially when it comes to sexual assault‚Äù. I told her ‚ÄúWhat you said goes against your views for equality‚Äù. ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù She says. I told her ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt believe that sexual assault can happen to anyone, even men, then you do not want equality. Many men don‚Äôt come out about their assaults, because they don‚Äôt get taken seriously/they‚Äôre laughed at.‚Äù 

We got into a heated argument for about 2 hours, and now I‚Äôm currently blocked. Haven‚Äôt heard from her since Monday.

TLDR: my friend didn‚Äôt believe men could get assaulted, I told her we could, and she didn‚Äôt believe me and got mad.",24,0

I have always been bothered by certain cliche and stereotype even since i was little and very ignorant of life,like men not being able to cook and clean,being inconsiderate,a girl can do anything a man can,etc.. etc..,so maybe i was predisposed to it. I have have watched many sides of this discussion: the one that wants a return to traditional values,the one that bashes women and feminism,the one that focus on legal rights,the one more concerned with men rather than women,the one that tangentially touched this arguments because of media and games,the one outside of time and space,that focus more on the true nature of humans and relationships and so on. I have thought of doing something myself,become an activist. I have raised the issues with family,friends and schoolmates,but never on a serious level. Partly because i live in a different, traditional country,and some of the feminist arguments can be argued. Partly for my ignorance on the argument. Partly for the fact that i cannot feel intellectually honest,since i have a great deal of anger toward women,for legitimate and illegitimate reasons,and i sometimes doubts of the legitimacy of certain claims. But,i have started to see signs of the USA feminism appear in my country.

## ALERT:¬†Contact¬†Florida Governor¬†Ron¬†DeSantis

#### Ask The Governor Why Florida Is Failing To Provide Proper¬†Care For Minor Male Victims of Sex Trafficking

Dear Friends of USIAHT,  


We need your help to ensure that the Florida Department of Children &amp; Families (DCF) places male victims of sex trafficking under the age of 18 at¬†USIAHT's Florida Safe Home. ¬†  


üì∑Florida DCF identified 376 male youth victims between 2017-2019, while USIAHT's Florida safe home provided care for only 19 victims during that period.¬†  


This means Florida has failed to deliver safe home trauma/restorative treatment to over 350 young Florida boys identified as victims of sex trafficking in the last three years, and as a result, our home has operated on average at 50% capacity since opening in 2016.

"An attempt to explain why ""women are wonderful""","&gt; The women-are-wonderful effect is the phenomenon found in psychological and sociological research which suggests that people associate more positive attributes with women compared to men. (Wikipedia)

The reason the Wikipedia article gives is: ""the association between women and nurturing characteristics""  (plus typical feminist craziness that I'm gonna bypass here). Yeah, it can be that it has something to do with mothers, if that's what the article means. But because that's a bit unsatisfactory - we all know all kinds of women, not just our mothers - I decided to develop a better explanation by contemplating the question for about 15 minutes.

I think it really comes down to how women's faces look. Seriously. Women's faces look different form men's faces in two ways: 1) they are more childlike and 2) they are on average more average and, thus, more attractive. 

First, we all, okay, most agree that children are wonderful. If they weren't we wouldn't want to do almost anything for them, if they are our own, and a lot even when they aren't. The same mechanisms that evolution ""designed"" to protect and help children certainly play a role when we look at or think about women. The effect fades as the years go by but rarely totally.

Second, women are indeed better-looking than men. That's not only because many have those cute childlike features. It's also because good looks actually mean mostly being average. And women are more average because of that ""extra"" chromosome (or some other reason, you tell me) probably in every way, also when it comes to the symmetry and other average feature of faces. Makeup helps to highlight the ordinariness (if that's not a paradox).

And here's something you perhaps didn't know: our brains are hardwired to think that more attractive looking people are also more honest, clever, and kind. You can read more from Robert M. Sapolsky's brilliant book *Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst*. Unfortunately, I don't have the book at hand, so I can't give the exact page numbers, but he discusses it at least twice  - without making the connection to women, though. 

So, now you know.

Men in courts and rape cases are guilty until proven innocent,"i saw a article today about a guy called jaxon lister who allegedly raped 20 girls anyways they reported it to the police and wanted the school to suspend him , get kicked out of his team and lose his scholarships and now there is a petition signed by 500k people to through him in jail 

i dont care about this guy specifically he could be actually guilts but just look how people are willing to believe the girls and want to ruin his life EVEN THO THERE IS NO PROOF and this happen to most people who are wrongly or falsely  accused nobody care even if the court proofed your innocence

Woman cause life is easier for women. The women I know in aggregate live better lives than the men I know and the people I know with the best lives are all women. I want the constant validation and self-esteem boosts that comes with being a woman. I want the ease women have when it comes to dating and finding love.

The female antagonist in the Columbo-series always has a good reason to kill the male victim (spoiler alert!),"I love the Columbo series but after watching it for the 10th time I noticed a sad phenomenon. When the murderer Columbo is after is a female then it always turns out that she killed the male victim to serve justice or to protect herself and others from the evil wrongdoings of the male victim. Columbo always takes a pity on female murderers and treats them differently than male murderers. Examples (spoilers):   
 

Season 8 episode 3: The murderer is dr. Joan Allenby and the victim is her boyfriend, David Kincaid. She kills Kincaid because he cheats on her. When Columbo finally catches her she pleads that there isn't a woman on Earth who wouldn't have considered killing a cheater. Again, it's hinted that the victim deserved to die and the real victim is the woman because now she has to go to prison for murder.   
  

Season 7 episode 3: The murderer is Kay Freestone, the victim is Mark Macandrews. Mark is Kay's abusive boss and lover. When Kay wants to leave him he threatens to ruin her career if she leaves. The abusive male victim deserved to die. Again. The ending dialogue hints that she will fight in court because the murder was justified by Mark's abuse.   
  

Season 6 episode 2: The murderer is Ruth Lytton, the victims are Janie Brandt's father, Ruth's brother Edward Lytton and the security guard. It turns out that she killed Janie's father because he was a monster and killed her own brother because he wanted to sell the museum she loved. The guard was a criminal in and out of prison so he was yet another negative male character. After the truth unravels Columbo hushes up the truth about the murder of Janie's father because he takes pity on these women. The viewer is pressured to feel like the men deserved to die.   


Season 7 episode 1: The murderer is Abigail Mitchell, the victim is Edmund Galvin. It turns out that she murdered Edmund (portrayed as a useless playboy) because she suspected that he killed her niece a few years back. It was never proven that he actually did it, just hinted by the murderer. Again the viewer was made to feel like the victim actually deserved to die a horrible death and the murderer is just an old lady who wanted justice. Her justice.   


Season 5 episode 1: The murderer is Grace Wheeler Willis, the victim is dr. Henry Willis, the husband. The husband doesn't want to give a bunch of money for his wife's new play so she kills him and makes it look like a suicide. It turns out that the murderer is actually suffering from a fatal illness and doesn't even remember committing the murder so Columbo takes pity on her and doesn't arrest her, since she will (probably) die soon anyway. Nobody gives two fucks about the male victim, he is considered an asshole because he refused to give his wife the money she needed. It also turns out that Grace married him for his money. So the gold digger gets away with murder.   


Season 3 episode 1: The murderer is Viveca Scott, the victim is Karl Lessing and Shirley Blaine. Karl is a thief who stole a formula from Viveca's beauty company and wants to ruin her with it. She tries to negotiate with him but he refuses and even humiliates her so she kills him in a moment of rage. Shirley finds out and tries to extort money from Viveca so she gets killed as well. Again the woman is portrayed as the victim and the man portrayed as the real criminal who deserved to die.   


  Season 1 episode 5: The murderer is Beth Chadwich and the victim is her brother, Bryce Chadwick. Beth's life is controlled by abusive men, first her father and then her brother. When her brother tries to chase away her love interest she decides to kill him. In the end the viewer feels like that she was the real victim of the men who abused her all her life.   


Probably the only episode where the woman is a true psychotic murderer is Season 9 episode 4: Rest in peace, Mrs. Columbo. The rest of the episodes featuring female criminals are all wired to feel sorry for women and to hate the male victims.

I know it's just a silly series but 50 years later people still feel the same and it's sad.",17,0
Another misandrist article musing about what to do with 'excess' males,"[https://archive.vn/gaKZw](https://archive.vn/gaKZw)

Key areas of the article relevant to/dismissing people concerned about male issues

""Men‚Äôs  rights advocates have often attempted to weaponize facts like  these  against feminism, on the basis that men ‚Äúhave it worse‚Äù than  women. But  male expendability and female subjugation are two sides of  the same  coin. The same logic that keeps women and their sexuality under  jealous  guard and treats them as a prize to be awarded is also what  casts the  majority of men into a Hobbesian struggle for that prize‚Äîensuring   continued reproduction of a social order gov¬≠erned by a predominantly   male elite. Contrary to both traditionalist conservative myth and   popular feminist narrative, for most of history patriarchy was not a   privilege one benefited from simply by being born male, but a brutal   racket in which millions of men destroyed each other and the world   around them for the benefit of a fortunate few.""

""If   the consequences were limited to an occasional unhinged manifesto and a   few more entries in the depressingly frequent list of mass shoot¬≠ings,   we could perhaps content ourselves with occasionally mocking incels   while ignoring them the rest of the time. But they are only the tip of   the iceberg. Given that incels tend to be drawn from white (or   white-adjacent) portions of the suburban and exurban middle class, there   is a tendency to dismiss their predicament as one of privilege and   entitlement. Yet it is also possible to see them as a local variant of a   global crisis of masculinity that unites their fates with those of  less  ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù men. In the United States, men make up over 90  percent of  the prison population. In [South Sudan](https://archive.vn/o/gaKZw/https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2017/12/19/the-link-between-polygamy-and-war), the combination of polygamy and bride prices has contributed directly to civil war. [ISIS](https://archive.vn/o/gaKZw/https://womenintheworld.com/2016/05/24/isis-recruits-young-syrians-with-the-promise-of-wives-from-the-womens-market/) has recruited frustrated Muslim men with the promise of wives. In countries like [East Germany](https://archive.vn/o/gaKZw/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/world/europe/merkel-east-germany-nationalists-populism.html),   the disproportionate emi¬≠gration of women better adapted to seek work   in Western cities has left behind a population of angry men who form  the  primary base for Far Right movements. And in India, the same   phenomenon, exacerbated by a gender imbalance stemming from   sex-selective abortion, has [exploded](https://archive.vn/o/gaKZw/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/we-dont-have-any-fear-indias-angry-young-men-and-its-lynch-mob-crisis/2018/08/26/9a0a247a-a0aa-11e8-a3dd-2a1991f075d5_story.html) into a violent religious fanaticism. As the [*Economist*](https://archive.vn/o/gaKZw/https://www.economist.com/essay/2015/05/28/men-adrift) writes, ‚ÄúThe world‚Äôs most dysfunctional people are nearly all male.‚Äù

Understood   in this way, the incel‚Äôs predicament is a bitterly ironic one. For in   addition to the targets of their rage, incels victimize themselves by   supporting the very same ideologies that lie at the root of their   immiseration. They decry the materialism and shallowness of   ‚Äúgold-digging‚Äù women who only care about men‚Äôs wealth and social status   while in the same breath opposing feminist equality and upholding the   gender norms that enshrine men as providers. They extol marriage while   opposing the sorts of economic redistributionist policies that would   make it easier for men like them to attain and sustain it. They adopt   white supremacist ideologies that demonize black and immigrant men   instead of recognizing their common plight. And with their view of   history hopelessly distorted by consumer media, they pine for [‚Äútraditional‚Äù eras](https://archive.vn/o/gaKZw/https://americanmind.org/post/wat-iz-bronze-age-mindset/)   in which, in all statistical likeli¬≠hood, they would find themselves   serving as cannon fodder in some lord‚Äôs army, wasting away from scurvy   at sea, or hauling stones under an overseer‚Äôs whip. But one need not   have any sympathy for incels to recognize that simply admonishing them   to ‚Äúbe better‚Äù and less entitled is an inadequate response to a   confluence of technological and demographic change, and that the   conditions that breed them create a more dangerous world for us all.""",38,0

I think the occurrence of false rape cases are much much higher than what is reported.,"Lately, i've been thinking about it . And I have come to conclusion that false rape cases against men occur much much more than what is reported.

Firstly, they simply don't report the real number because it hurts their propaganda. Secondly, the technicalities aspect of ""reports"" make it so that even when someone wants to publish honestly, it's nearly impossible. If for some reason the court punishes a man for rape even when everyone knows it's false, the technicalities make it so that one has to report it as a genuine case of rape or it could simply be labeled as misinformation. If you think this doesn't occur often, just look at Johnny Depp's case. Man lost the case despite having all the evidences. Up until a few years ago men couldn't expect any legal support as a victim of rape (and many of countries even today). And when you do break the norm and try to ask help, many men are denied of any legal help.",21,0

Something we can do instead of banning male neonatal circumcision.,"I can see a ban on circumcision would be much harder than passing a law banning the creation of products from human flesh. Human flesh cannot be legally sold, but products created from them can. Hospitals can illegally sell the foreskin away instead of disposing of it as medical waste, since there's no way they're going to get caught, and profit 100k$ per baby foreskin.

Who does this money go towards? Not the children who were circumcised, not the parents of the baby circumcised, but to line some sadistic fatcats pockets.

My conclusion I've come to is this if we ban the use of human flesh to make products, then circumcision rates will plummet. Hospitals and doctors only push for it to be done so they can sell the flesh illegally. Hell, they're making 100k$ per circumcision, so why wouldn't they push for it? Profit-driven and unnecessary procedures could be stopped dead in their tracks.",20,0

Are my parents right about this?,"Hi I am a 23 year old woman and feminist with a personal question.
I've got the opportunity to be a model for a body positivity, lgtbq+ friendly overall amazing underwear brand (La Fille D'O). The style of the photographer and also owner of the brand is very direct; with visible nipples, hair and everything.

I am an artist myself and my work is very much about the female experience especially about sexualization of our body. I go completely nude for my own photography, paintings and performance all the time. So even without this shoot my body is out there, in a direct way.

I told my parents the news I would be doing this shoot. They had no problem with me modelling as a lingerie model, but they have a problem with this brand because it is too nude, too direct, overall not pretty. They came with the following arguments;

- what would the rest of my family think?

- What if I needed another job which won't appreciate the nudity?

- I would make their life harder by doing this shoot because they would have to face my family and, wait for it, their colleagues. My father even fears losing his job because of these hypothetical pictures.

This last one really stuck with me. Aren't they just making me feel guilty for living my life, which I try to live in an empowering way?

I am wondering what you think? Is there any way I would really be such a burden? Is this a valid reason for a 23 year old to feel guilty, maybe even hesitating doing the shoot to begin with.



I hope this is the right place to ask this. Thanks!",16,1

I myself get worried when I know my girlfriend is going out at night. Are there things that I can do to make women comfortable and generally improve quality of life? Things you notice a lot of men do maybe even subconsciously that may make women unhappy? If you have any suggestions on how I can help with other groups that face similar issues I would love to hear it too!",14,1

Be like men!,"In our current society, we are heading towards a change where women are required to be more masculine, as far as I've come to notice. And a few years ago, I would have been full on board with this movement seeing as I was rather ""boyish"" in my youth. Being like so, I generally hung out with the male crowd as well, instead of with my own sex. 

And then I grew to be an adult. I grew more independent as I finally found a position in the work field of IT. And at first I thought, yes, this is what I'm supposed to do. Now all I need to do is climb the corporal ladder and be great! Right?

And then I seemingly realized out of nowhere that I absolutely hated the direction I was heading and that I've been making wrong choices one after another under the guise of being a successful woman, praised for being ""like a man"". 

I've been encouraged from a young age to focus on my career above anything else. The internet taught be the exact same thing, with the feminist movements demanding equality in male dominated workfields. That women can and **should** play in the same territory as men. That women aren't just baby making house wives.

I should focus on making money and making a name for myself, right?

Well, apperantly I was wrong on this, in regards to myself at least and that, in all honestly, I don't give a flying fuck what's in my bank account or where I am in the corporal ladder. I'm praised for being a woman in a male dominated field, as if that even means anything in the first place? ¬†

One day, I seemingly had an epiphany. I saw the world around me and I see both parents working 9/5 jobs, their children mostly left to fend for themselves as both parents are too busy making money. They push their children into educating systems they have no idea what exactly they are teaching their kids and frankly... they don't care, so long as they get an education and will be part of the workforce once they reach adulthood. 

The traditions of their own home are forgotten, because there is no time for traditions anyways. Families are no longer close to one another, but distanced, sometimes even arrogant towards one another. Spiteful.

Divorce rates are rising, depression rates in teens and adults are rising, the human psyche, I feel, is in danger, because we are stuffed in a system which no longer cares for human well being, but only for the progress of the technological machine we have created.

And I believe, part of that problem is the fact that we no longer care about our natural predespositions. We have forgotten that women, first and foremost, are bringers of life. That we are mothers. That is something so sacred and powerful, and it's now slowly being irradicated. And what for? Because there are ignorant people who not only can't see beyond the fact that we are more than just baby makers, but also because they see brining life on earth as beneath them? Fucking moronic.

I am aware that this doesn't apply everyone. Exceptions are everywhere. There are truly women who are ambitious in nature and find satisfaction rising in the hirarchy instead of ever thinking about having children, just like there are men who naturally feel drawn to nurturing and taking care of others, be they children or adult. 

There will always be outliners in every aspect of out lives and it is right that we make space for them, because they deserve their own spotlight.

But at the same time, making space for outliners is no excuse for demolishing what used to be to fit *just* these outliners. Being a housewife nowadays seems to be so frowned upon, as if a woman is less than those working their ass off in jobs they couldn't care less about, when it is so fulfiling to watch your own child grow into someone healthy, strong, smart and powerfull, someone you will be proud of, because you were by their side, helping them, guiding them, *loving* them unconditionally as every human being deserves to be loved.

It's as if a housewife, a woman who takes care of her home and children, is less than her husband who provides, when both sides are equally important for the growth of healthy human relationships. Why is the feminine seen as weak? Why must we be masculine to feel confident in our own skin? 

We seem to switch partners like we switch clothes, commitment seemingly forgotten. ""Just like men"". I see so many indepenent women try to teach their fellow sisters this same phrase. This has nothing to do with being like men! This is being irresponsible! They say it's for experience, for pleasure, but what experience do you gain repeating the same cycle over and over again? Not all pleasures are meant to be overindulged. Some come with consequences. 

And when those consequences happen, we try to blame it on others rather than ourselves. After all, we were just chasing pleasures and gaining experience.

We pursue careers, not because we are passionate about them, but to feel empowered, to feel equal when we've been equal from the very beginning! Our values simply lie in a different field but people seem to be unable to translate these values into something measurable to that which men bring forth. And so, we have to change ourselves? This is no longer about equality... Equality should be about teaching the ignorant that women bring just as much worth into this world as men do. Be proud to be a woman! There is no pride in being ""like a man"".

We seek indepence from men. But why must we be independent of men, when men are just as dependent on women? Or is it the ignorance of the few who speak the loudest that makes you believe that the masculine does not need the feminine to feel balanced and fulfilled in life? ¬†

Why are we so against partnerships? Why are we so against humanity and nature? 

I'm seeing how humanity is growing colder and colder. We are erradicating the warmth that we bring to this world. They preach to be different, yet the differences they support are superficial, meanwhile the differences they loath run deep in our nature. Women are being masculinized, because men can't be feminized. 

This is true patriarchy, for those who believe. And it is not the fault of men. It is the women who keep preaching:

How Covid-19 led to a global crisis in maternity care,"Hi everyone. I looked into pandemic restrictions on maternity care around the world, and found some pretty shocking stuff, with women's rights violated globally. In some countries women have been pressured to have inductions and c-sections in order to ease pressure on health systems and protect against Covid-19. There is also some evidence now that disruptions to care and reduced services have led to worse maternal and neonatal outcomes, heightened anxiety and depression, and increased birth trauma. Take a look &gt;&gt; [https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/12/how-covid-19-led-global-crisis-](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/12/how-covid-19-led-global-crisis-maternity-care)",1,1

If anyone knows whether it's worth watching the rest. Let me know. Cause at this point the star trek  og level of sexist casting is annoying as hell. Also the plot is 50% gun battles.

Volunteering overseas,Hi! I really would like to volunteer in a different country through a feminist organization to help with women‚Äôs rights and women‚Äôs health. I am graduating high school this year and will be 18 and would love to take a trip to do this over the summer before I start college. My family is very religious and would like me to do a mission trip instead. I am trying to find a feminist organization that is faith based as a compromise but am having a difficult time. I was wondering if anyone has done something like this and could reccomend some organizations. Thanks!!,2,1

Should The First Female President Be Voted In or Forced In,"As we know Kamala Harris is the next VP of the US. We also know how racist and sexist America is. She is both black and a woman, which unfortunately a unfortunate amount of people will probably have a problem with, if they already don‚Äôt. I know everyone imagined a female President one day, but do you want to see that happen in a voted election and would you have a problem if Joe just steps down in a few years and makes her the first female President by default without the election process. Would you still feel like women have overcome or would it not feel like a real win?",0,1
